How many examples does the writer use in the passage?	Business people must keep records of the money they take in and the money they spend. The work of keeping such records is called book keeping. The work of deciding how the records should be set up is called accounting. An accountant also finds out, from the records, whether or not a business is doing well. Suppose a man owns a small clothing store. He keeps records that show that he spent money for newspaper advertising, and for suit, coats, shoes, and neckties to sell to his customers. He had to pay a young man to help him in the store. He also paid rent and had other expenses. At the end of the year. He must take an inventory. That is, he counts how many pieces of clothing he has on hand. Then he must find out exactly how many he sold, how much money he spent in running the business. If he took in more than he spent, he made a profit for the year. If he spent more than he took in he suffered a loss. The owner of a small clothing store can keep accounting records without much trouble. But a giant oil company or a big bank has many difficult accounting problems. The company must know how much money is to be paid by its debtors and how much it owns other companies for supplies. It must know how much the company's buildings and machines are worth, and how much the company has lost in depreciation , or wear and tear, of its equipment. All of this information must be kept in the company's accounts. Big companies employ many accountants.	['two']

We often want something personal and thoughtful. But how can we make it? These following ideas may help you. Gift of Time Moms just want to spend time with their children so make it a Mother-Daughter/Son day. Spend the whole day with her. Do the things she likes doing with her. Home Video Take your family videos and make them a short home video. She can enjoy it whenever she misses you.

The writer mainly wants to tell us _ .	"Ted, my little brother, is in Grade One. Last Friday he came back from school with a letter. The letter was from his teacher. ""I got a red flower today. Could you please sign this note?"" he said to Mum. The note showed that he had been talking in class. Ted hardly gets top scores in his school work. The best he gets is ""OK"", but often he gets ""You can do better than this."" Mum knows what it means. She tells me ""You can do better than this"" means ""Extremely bad"" in China. In the USA, teachers never say anything too bad about their students, even if the students are making trouble in class or not working hard enough. The worst they might say is ""Please be nicer tomorrow"". Many parents are satisfied with--- a B-grade for each subject. But things in Chinese schools are quite different. Parents have _ for their children. I sometimes felt that my second-grade cousin spent more time on homework than I did when I was a 6thgrader in the USA! Yet his parents and teachers didn't think he worked hard enough. Is it too strict in China? Or is it not strict enough in the USA? Maybe both are true."

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? _	"Little Mark is only 6, but he has an IQ of 200, a genius among geniuses. _ His parents must keep him intellectually simulated while making sure he is like any other little boy. Mark has been attracted by the way how the world works since he was a baby. When he was 3, Mark was reading fluently, mostly self-taught. His parents haven't been able to keep him away from books since. ""I tried many times to stop him reading. We worry about his crazy fond of reading because he constantly wants to read every-thing whatever it is."" A psychologist at the Centre for gifted children tested Mark and gave him an IQ of 200. The average child of Mark's age has an IQ of 100. At 200, Mark is a genius-even compared with other child geniuses. ""With children like Mark you can tell that's a bright child as soon as they walk in. They just have this sort of intensity, and maybe they're not so good at communicating with people,"" the psychologist said. ""He will never fit perfectly into a class where he's with children of his age.""But Mark's mother worries about the ""socially isolated"" labels. ""Nobody wants their child to grow up with that image. I want him to communicate with others freely, but not to be frustrated academically, so it's really hard to find a balance,"" she says. Helen Dudeney from the Talented and Gifted Children Association says Mark is one in a million with such a high IQ. She points out that geniuses are still rare and difficult for the public education system to handle. ""The lack of coping comes because teachers aren't trained in teaching gifted children,"" says Dudeney. Helen believes it's also extremely important for them to be recognized and supported in their talents. Mark's parents are trying to figure out how best to help Mark. At the moment, there are few options. Mark finds first year work boring and simple, but he must learn to complete the work. His mother says, ""We just want to be happy. Just to have a happy childhood and want to go to school every day."""	"[""Mark's parents are very satisfied with his love for reading.""]"
At the beginning of the scheme, there was some difficulty with the _ .	"London started its first major bike hire scheme on July 30th. Transport For London (TFL), the agency responsible for moving people around England's capital, put 5,000 bicycles in 400 different places around the city. The idea is to cut traffic, reduce pollution and provide a greener way of getting around London's streets. The scheme had a few small problems on its first day as people could not lock the bikes properly once they had finished riding them. As a gesture of goodwill, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced all rentals on the first day would be free of charge. The bikes are available for free for the first 30 minutes but costs go up sharply since then. Renters have to pay $1.60 for the first hour and $78 for 24 hours. The bikes are clearly designed for very short trips. TFL says it sees a ""cycle revolution"" happening in London. It predicts there will be around 40,000 new cycle journeys every day on the rental bikes. Mr. Johnson says he wants to see a return to the turn of the 20th century, when 20 per cent of journeys in London were made by bicycle. The scheme has received a lot of positive feedback in the first two days. Many Londoners believe it is a great alternative to London's overcrowded and overpriced trains and buses. One person, Andy Clark, told the Reuters news agency, ""It's a great idea. I've seen it operating in Paris and Barcelona and thought why don't we have one?"" The Londonist Blog said the bikes were very strong and were ""designed to bear a beating from both careless cyclists and drunken people""."	['lock']
If you feel uncomfortable about attending a social event, the author advises you to _ .	If you've ever been to a social gathering, you might feel awkward and uncomfortable. While social gatherings can be very enjoyable, especially when you are surrounded by people whose company you enjoy, there are social events that you sometimes find yourself wishing you were someplace else. Such occasions can sometimes be the cause of much anxiety and self-consciousness. You may even feel like everyone else is having a good time except for you. Yet the truth is that everyone has felt shy and awkward on occasion. One of the best ways to overcome self-consciousness or get past your feelings of shyness at social gatherings is to focus on the people around you. If you can remember that other people might also be feeling awkward or shy, you might find the thought of speaking to them less overwhelming. The next time there is a social event you feel nervous about attending, you may want to try this exercise: Spend some time with your eyes closed and breathe deeply. When you feel ready, create your own zone of comfort by _ yourself surrounded in a warm white light that is protective yet accepting of others. Imagine people at the event being drawn to you because of the open and warm feelings that you are showing. When you arrive at the event, take a moment to spread this same light of loving acceptance to everyone around you. Smile and greet people warmly. Try going up to someone who is standing alone and introduce yourself. When you show acceptance and openness, people can't help but respond to you in kind. Focusing on how we can make other people at a social gathering feel at ease can help us forget about our own insecurities. The next time you attend a social gathering, invite people to join you in your zone of comfort that you have so lovingly and intentionally created. Let yourself enjoy being encircled in the warmth of their friendships.	['be open and warm to others']
What was the father's favorite?	"When my father was getting ready for work, our house was ruled by knocks and words. He used to come downstairs to breakfast. The morning paper lay beside his plate. He always read the ""Deaths"" first, and then he knocked once on the table. One of my sisters brought his toast ,already buttered for him. Usually he said nothing, but once I heard him say, ""I love you very much, Edith. I would love you more if you buttered my toast on both sides."" He read the paper all through breakfast. Two knocks on the table meant ""I am ready for my tea."" If a single knock followed, that meant ""More toast, please."" After breakfast he said, ""Boots."" The paper was spread for him over the back of an armchair. Yesterday's paper was put on the chair for his feet, and his boots were brought to him, freshly cleaned. He read standing, at the same time putting on his boots. With one boot finished, he said, ""Bus."" At that point one of the girls went outside to the garden gate and waited there. Her job was to stop the bus when it came. It came early sometimes, and it had to wait for my father. ""Overcoat, hat."" One of my sisters had already brushed his overcoat. Now she held it open for him and guided his arms into it. Another girl came with his hat, nicely brushed. ""Handkerchief, pipe ."" They were brought and put, with his tobacco , into his pockets. He looked out of the window and said either ""Walking stick"" or ""Umbrella"". It was handed to him. Ready now, he was still reading the paper. He did not put it down until he heard the shout ""Bus coming!"" Then he kissed my mother and went out. The girls breathed freely. How lucky a man is to have a wife and five daughters at home!"

The passage is written here to show that Lennon has _ .	On December 8, 1980, John Lennon -an English musician who rose to fame as one of the founding members of Liverpool pop band The Beatles - was shot dead outside his New York apartment. In the 1960s and 70s, Lennon was one of the most iconic men on the planet. Some 30 years ago on from his death, he is still respected by many people in the West. The Beatles, formed in 1960 in Liverpool, were one of the most commercial successful acts on the history of pop music, with, according to some estimates, global record sales over 1.1 billion. The band conveyed the progressive ideals in which many young people of the time believed. In the 1960s and 70s, widespread tension developed in both British and American society, regarding issues such as women's rights and the Vietnam War. Lennon in particular became known for his message of peace and for his opposition to the war in Vietnam. This led to an attempt by former US president Richard Nixon to drive him away from the US. Lennon's second-wife Yoko Ono was also politically active. Lennon was also hugely admired for his musical abilities. Along with fellow-Beatle Paul, Lennon and McCartney were the Beatle's song-writing team. After Lennon was shot by crazy fan Mark Chapman,one of his most iconic songs, Imagine, became a humanist anthem . Lennon's legacy survived his death and continued till this day. In 2008, he was ranked the fifth greater singer of all time in US-based Rolling Stone magazine. Former possessions of Lennon or furnishings from his homes continue to be sold for vast sums. In an auction to be held next week in London, lines written by Lennon on the back of a demand for an outstanding bill are expected to sell for PS350,000(3.7 million yuan). In August, a bathroom from his last home in Britain, was auctioned for PS9,500. And in 2009, a British film describing his early years before the Beatles began, was one of the most successful films of the years in the UK. But do Lennon and his music continue to resonate with the young people of today?	['lasting appeal']

Which of the following measures is NOT mentioned to solve the population ageing problem?	There are many older people in the world and there will be many more. A little-known fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization, by 2020 there will be 1 billion, with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries. For example, it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent. It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk? One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live ,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability. Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible, including during old age, to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value the older people in their society. In some African countries, certainly in Asia, older people are respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge. Yet traditions are fading away daily, which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people. As society changes, attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination in employment. Life-long learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people. Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net. To achieve equality in such matters will take considerable time and effort. One thing is sure:there is no time to be lost.	['Providing free health care for sick older people.']
Why were the author's family especially busy when they got off the plane?	"The plane landed with a gentle stop at the airport in Paris. I looked out of the window and noticed the boiling hot sun was shinning down on the city. I stepped down the stairs into the luggage room, and my family were practically busy. I walked down to the convey belt and waited for my suitcase to come along. I must wait there for about ten minutes before it actually came, by then my family had signed forms so we could be let into the country properly. I met up with my dad by the main entrance. My extremely annoying sister Talia was waving at us from the exit of the airport. My dad and I walked over and left the airport. We walked around for an hour before we actually found our hotel. The French taxi driver had dropped us off at the wrong hotel, and we found out the hotel he had dropped us off about an hour away from where our hotel was. We walked around different streets. We walked into different shops, but they all had the same answer ""sorry"". My mom was so annoyed that she took about several mouthfuls of her vodka she'd bought at this alcohol shop before. When we finally made it to the hotel, we checked in and made our way to our rooms. We were on the 17th floor, so the elevator ride up was rather long. I also had to share a room with Talia, which didn't really make my day. Ks5u I got into my room and sat on my bed. I took my shoes and socks off and rubbed my hurt feet. Could this day get any worse? Well it could. ""Let's go,"" my mom said excitedly. ""Go where?"" I said unwillingly. ""Outside of course, we're in France! I want to taste the snails, the frogs' legs, the ... French wine!"" she said. We stepped out of the hotel entrance and lights came from everywhere. It looked wonderful and a bit like New York, but the building weren't as high and everyone looked so kind. We walked down to the Eiffel Tower which was amazing, it was beautiful. I know I had to see this again, but maybe when I wasn't so tired. I sat down on the grass, and looked up at the sky, Paris looked wonderful at night, and the stars in the sky added to the effect. I looked back down and someone caught my eye, his face was not very familiar..."	['Because they had to sign forms to enter France properly.']
What do the education centres do to accept students?	"UK education is all about giving you inspiration to develop your knowledge and skills, freedom to be creative, and support to help you achieve your best. On a UK course you will benefit from excellent teaching and facilities. In order to accept students, UK education centres must meet strict quality standards set by the UK government and education bodies. With such a good reputation for research and education, universities and colleges in the UK attract some of the world's leading academics and professionals. You will be encouraged to express your own ideas and think for yourself. The attention to quality is reflected in the UK's excellent results: Four of the top six universities in the world are in the UK. The UK is a world-leading research nation. 54% of the research conducted by UK universities and colleges is classed as either ""world-leading"" or ""internationally excellent"". At the most recent inspection, 97% of further education colleges were judged satisfactory or better, for their overall effectiveness. In the recent BIS Tracking International Graduate Outcomes survey, more than 88% of international higher education graduates said they were satisfied with their UK learning experience. Likewise, in the Higher Education Academy Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey of UK postgraduate students, 93% rated the quality of teaching positively. For English language students, you'll find the UK has long been at the forefront of language teaching, and pioneered many of the techniques now used around the world. The emphasis is on learning the language through fun and participation: Instead of just listening to your teacher, your classes will involve games, problem-solving and discussions. You might also listen to songs, watch television or read magazines to practise your comprehension skills. The UK's boarding schools also offer excellent teaching, facilities and support. At UK independent schools (most boarding schools are independent), a teacher has just 9.4 pupils on average, so teachers have more time to give you individual support. This is reflected in the results: 91% of students from UK independent schools go on to higher education."	['To meet strict quality standards.']

The passage can't be in/on _ .	Thousands of people have been killed in a massive earthquake in Japan. The quake -- the most powerful to hit Japan in more than 100 years -- caused massive _ and many people are missing and feared dead. The 8.9 magnitude quake struck Friday(March 11) off Japan's eastern coast, and prompted tsunami warnings across the Pacific as far away as South America and the U.S. West Coast. Several days after a 8.9-magnitude earthquake and resulting 10-meter-high tsunami devastated the coastline. The United States Geological Survey says it was the fifth largest earthquake since 1900. The largest, with a 9.5 magnitude, shook Chile in 1960. In Japan, the tsunami swept away boats, cars and hundreds of houses in coastal areas north of Tokyo. The quake shook buildings in the Japanese capital and caused several fires. All train and subway traffic in Tokyo has been stopped, and thousands of people there were unable to get back home. People are just trying to find clean water. Food supplies are running out. In the convenience stores, there are no rice balls left. There is no bottled water left. People are facing a really serious situation in the days ahead for these people that are living in areas that were only moderately damaged. The final death toll could range from the thousands to tens of thousands, depending on how many of these communities are gone. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the government would do everything it can to minimize the effects of the disaster. And in Washington, President Obama said the United States is ready to help the people of Japan.	['March 10th newspapers']
David Birch claims that he only hires liberal-arts people because _ .	"If you know exactly what you want, the best route to a job is to get specialized training.A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training. That's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers.At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement.Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience. But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off.Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval.The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, _ . As further evidence of the erosion of corporate faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State's Scheetz cites a pattern in corporate hiring practices.Although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management.""They want someone who isn't constrained by nuts and bolts to look at the big picture, "" says Scheetz. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have:writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems.David Birch claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, ""I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things, "" says Birch.Liberal-arts means an academically thorough and strict program that includes literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior-plus a computer course or two.With that under your belt, you can feel free to specialize.""A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace, "" says Scheetz."

She never once complained or pitied herself, her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home.

What is the main idea of this passage?	Friendship is always the center in our life. Friends often affect our health and energy. More and more people are turning towards their friends for support and sharing. We may have a very unclear understanding of what makes a friend but we all want to have many good friends around us. There are certain steps that can win you friends or at least help you get close to those whom you want to make friends with. The first step to make friends with someone is to make him like you. If they don't like you in the beginning, it is impossible for them to become your friends. To let someone know that you're interested in him, a little smile and calling him by his name can help. To make the other person feel important, you need to be a good listener and encourage the other person to talk. Give your honest and real opinions but do not make fun of him or her. The second step is to fully understand each other. You need to share his or her opinions. So, it is necessary for you to develop a habit of seeing things from the other person's point of view . The third and final step is to show your support and encouragement towards your friend.	['How to make friends.']
"Who gave the name ""the Swiss army knife"" to the knife discussed in the passage?"	"The Swiss army knife is a popular device that is recognized all over the world. In Switzerland, there is a saying that every good Swiss citizen has one in his or her pocket. But the knife had poor beginnings. In the late nineteenth century, the Swiss army issued its soldiers a gun that required a special screwdriver to take it apart and clean it. At the same time, canned food was becoming common in the army. Swiss generals decided to issue each soldier a standard knife to serve both as a screwdriver and a can opener. _ was a lifesaver for Swiss knife makers, who were struggling to compete with cheaper German imports. In 1884, Carl Elsener, head of the Swiss knife manufacturer(maker) Victorinox, seized that opportunity with both hands, and designed a soldier's knife that the army loved. It was a simple knife with one big blade , a can opener, and a screwdriver. A few years after the soldier's knife was issued, the ""Schweizer Offizier Messer,"" or Swiss Officer's Knife, came on the market. Interestingly, the Officer's Knife was never given to those serving in the army. The Swiss army purchasers considered the new model with a corkscrew for opening wine not ""essential for survival,"" so officers had to buy this new model by themselves. But its special multi-functional design later launched the knife as a global brand. After the Second World War, a great number of American soldiers were stationed in Europe. And as they could buy the Swiss army knife at shops on army bases, they bought huge quantities of them. However, it seems that ""Schweizer Offizier Messer"" was too difficult for them to say, so they just called it the Swiss army knife, and that is the name it is now known by all over the world."	['American soldiers.']
What can we conclude from the passage?	"Have you ever walked outside thinking it was one temperature but quickly discovered it felt colder? That is because of the ""wind chill"" effect. Wind chill is how cold people and animals feel when they are outside, not the actual temperature on the thermometer . It is based on how quickly your body loses heat when it is exposed to wind and cold. When the wind is strong, your body quickly loses heat, making the temperature of your skin drop. When scientists first started calculating wind chill, they used research conducted in 1945 by explorers to Antarctica who measured how quickly water froze outside. But water freezes faster than exposed skin, so the wind chill index based on that data wasn't accurate. In 2001, the US government began to measure wind chill more precisely by testing how quickly people's skin froze. Twelve volunteers were placed in a chilled wind tunnel. Equipment was stuck to their faces to measure the heat flow from their cheeks, forehead, nose and chin while they walked three miles per hour on a treadmill . The experiment revealed how quickly exposed skin can be damaged, particularly unprotected areas like your fingers, toes, the tip of your nose and your ear lobes. In fact, 40 percent of your body heat can be lost through your head! Signs you might have frostbite are when the skin turns white or pale and you lose feeling in that area. The information collected from the volunteers helped scientists work out the math to compute wind chill. It involves wind speed and air temperature. If, for example, the temperature outside is zero degrees Fahrenheit and the wind is blowing at 15 miles per hour, the wind chill is calculated at 19 degrees below zero. At that wind chill temperature, exposed skin can freeze in 30 minutes. You can find a calculation table at www.nws.noaa.gov/om/windchill/index.shtml. Experts advise in cold weather that you wear loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing, worn on top of each other. Air caught between the clothes will keep you warm. The best cold-weather coats have head coverings made of woven material that keep out water. So next time the temperature drops and you want to play outside, listen to your parents when they tell you to wrap up warm!"	"[""Compared with water, people's exposed skin freezes more slowly.""]"
From the passage, we know that use words and sentences to express ideas and thoughts.	"Animals, including insects , don't have a 'language' like ours. They do not 'talk' to each other in words and sentences . But if we watch them, we can see that they have their ways of communicating with each other. Can you see the rabbit's tail? When rabbits see this white tail moving up and down, they run away. They know that they are in danger. The rabbit told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal . Many other animals use this kind of 'language'. When a cobra is angry, it raises its head and makes itself look powerful . This warns other animals. When a bee found some food, it goes back to its home. It cannot 'tell' the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance. This tells the bees where the food is. Some animals 'say' things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when it is pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, evry sound has its own meaning. Sometimes we human beings speak in the same way. We make sounds like""Oh"" or ""Ah"" when we are afraid or happy or when we drop something on our toes."	['human beings']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	Chocolate is one of the most popular foods in the world. Many people choose it as a birthday gift. When a child gets a box of chocolate as a gift, he may feel happy. It is popular among people, especially among children. Chocolate tastes nice. People eat chocolate candy, chocolate cake and chocolate cookies. They also drink hot chocolate. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans. Here are some interesting things about cocoa beans. In the past, the Mayas and the Aztecs used cocoa beans as money because they were small, easy to carry, and not easy to find. A turkey cost ninety cocoa beans and a small rabbit cost thirty cocoa beans. They also cooked the beans and mixed them with water. Sometimes they added corn or hot pepper. They did not add sugar. The drink was very expensive. Only rich people could buy it.	['The Mayas and the Aztecs mixed the beans with water.']
Most of the drawings in the caves are about _ .	"Imagine looking for your lost dog. You step into a cave . But instead of the dog, you find beautiful cave paintings. You see paintings of horses, deer, and bison that are drawn in black, brown, red and yellow. Your first question would probably be ""Who did this?"" This is what happened to four French boys in 1940. They found the Lascaux caves. The paintings the boys discovered in those caves are 17,000 years old. They were drawn by the ancient people called Cro-Magnons. Cro-Magnons looked much like people of today. They used tools, such as fishing nets. But their art was extremely good. The main cave at Lascaux is called the Great Hall of Bulls, which has a picture of bulls and horses in many colors. The largest animal is 18 feet long. There are smaller animals, such as bison, stags and a bear. There is also a strange spotted two-horned animal. To the left of the main cave are the most famous paintings that are the drawings of multicolored animals. One painting is called Little Horses. On the ceiling are horses and cows. The most unusual sight may be in the Shaft of the Dead Man where there is a thinoceros , a carefully drawn dead man, a wounded bison and a bird. Why did Cro-Magnon artists do these beautiful drawings on cave walls? Did the drawings call upon some magical power? Did the Cro-Magnon people hope that the drawings would bring good luck? There is one thing the paintings seem to tell us. The Cro- Magnons were interested in the world. They looked at beauty and they understood it."	['animals']
What is the passage about?	"Online shopping is growing fast in China, and more and more Chinese are buying books online. At the same time, traditional bookstores are facing new challenges. A bookstore in Beijing is going out of business . All of its books are on sale. Bookstore owner Wang Jian says hot sales of books on the Internet pushed him to change the way he did business. China has the highest online book buying rate in the world. More than years ago, dangdang.com became the first online bookseller, and now becomes very important in the Chinese online book market. Facing this challenge, the Xinhua Bookstore also built its online store a few years ago. Zhang Jian, CEO of the Xinhuabookstore.com, says now they are enlarging their online services. A ""price war ""is taking shape between traditional bookstores and online bookstores. Faced with the low-cost advantage of online bookstores, traditional ones can do nothing but lower their prices. At the same time, online bookstores are also starting price wars between each other. Now some traditional bookstores are trying their best to attract buyers in their own way. They exhibit books better and provide a very relaxed reading environment in the bookstore. Even though, traditional bookstores can hardly compete with some of the advantages of online bookstores, for example 24-hour service."	['The challenges traditional bookstores face.']
What made Shawn Lee return to attend college again?	"I went to Arizona earlier this month to see what the college of the future might look like. What I found is an exciting new era of higher education that will help more students get a great, personalized education at an affordable price. This future may not always include the lecture halls, dormitories, and other features of the traditional college experience. Instead, the colleges I visited are experimenting with ways for students to get their degrees online, allowing them to take courses any place and at any time. These "" _ ,"" as they are sometimes called, are at the forefront of the effort to broaden access to higher education, especially for low-income students with full-time jobs and families. During my visit, I heard encouraging stories of students who were taking advantage of these flexible learning models to pursue degrees that could put them on paths to new careers. One of those students was Shawn Lee. He had a compelling story: After dropping out of college decades ago, he found himself in a series of low-paying, often back-breaking jobs. He recently decided to get his degree when he had his first child and wanted to start building a better life. Tucked away in an industrial park in Tempe, Rio Salado didn't look much like a traditional institute of higher education. There were no students running to class. Just a couple of glass-faced office buildings. The college had just 22 full-time faculty serving 60,000 students, with more than half of them attending classes online. Several students I met during my visit said they liked learning online. ""I've taken college classes in a big auditorium with herds of people. There was no personal connection,"" one student said. ""Now I can reach my teacher with the click of a mouse."" After several days' visit, I left Arizona feeling quite optimistic about what the future holds for higher education."

So far the great discovery scientists have made about the function of brain is _	"We often hear people say, ""I have a good memory for things like that"" or ""I can remember names"". But do you know memory is the single most important thing and it has played a very important part? For early men, there were dangerous all around them--bad weather, wild animals. The key to keep on living lay in man's ability to remember these dangers and the ways he had dealt with them in the past. In order for memories to be stored, the human brain became more complex. And as man learned how to deal with them, he became civilized . Surprisingly, scientists today understand little about memory and how it works. They have not yet found a way to open up the brain and observe its function without destroying it. Perhaps there are two types of memory: short-term and long-term. Short-term refers to those facts that stay with us for a few seconds to a few hours. For instance, when you stay at a hotel, you remember the room number and forget as soon as you leave. Long-term memory, on the other hand, means you remember things for a long period of time. If you spend your honeymoon in a particular hotel, it's likely that you'll remember your stay quite clearly. Scientists also believe that a short-term memory can become a long-term memory through consolidation . A lot of chemical and physical changes take place in the part of the brain. Although the human brain weighs three pounds, it contains 30 billion nerve cells acting like a computer. When those changes strengthen the links in certain nerve cells, a thought becomes part of the long-term memory."	['chemical and physical changes']
According to the passage, what is the right attitude to mistakes?	When you make a mistake, big or small, cherish it like it's the most precious thing in the world, because in some ways, it is. Most of us feel bad when we make mistakes, beat ourselves up about it, feel like failures, get mad at ourselves. And that's only natural. Most of us have been taught from a young age that mistakes are bad, and we should try to avoid mistakes. We've been scolded when we make mistakes--at home, school and work. Maybe not always, but probably enough times to make feeling bad about mistakes an unconscious reaction. Yet without mistakes, we could not learn or grow. If you think about it that way, mistakes should be cherished and celebrated for being one of the most amazing things in the world. They make learning possible; they make growth and improvement possible. By trial and error--trying things, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes--we have figured out how to make electric light, to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, to fly. Mistakes make walking possible for the smallest _ , make speech possible, and make works of genius possible. Think about how we learn:We don't just consume information about something and instantly know it or know how to do it. You don't just read about painting,or writing,or computer programming,or baking, or playing the piano, and know how to do them right away. Instead, you get information about something, from reading or from another person or from observing usually...then you construct a model in your mind...then you test it out by trying it in the real world...then you make mistakes...then you revise the model based on the results of your real world experimentation...and repeat, making mistakes, learning from those mistakes, until you've pretty much learned how to do something. That's how we learn as babies and toddlers, and how we learn as adults. Mistakes are how we learn to do something new--because if you succeed at something, it's probably something you already knew how to do. You haven't really grown much from that success--at most it's the last step on your journey, not the whole journey. Most of the journey is made up of mistakes, if it's a good journey. So if you value learning,if you value growing and improving,then you should value mistakes. They are amazing things that make a world of brilliance possible.	['We should treat mistakes as good chances to learn.']
According to the passage, we can infer that Eleanor did well in the field of _ .	"Eleanor Roosevelt was born in New York City on October 11, 1884. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her father died only two years later. Attending a good school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905. Within 11 years Eleanor bore six children; one son died early. In Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. When he was stricken with polio in 1921, she took care of him devotedly. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. When Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House, she understood social conditions well and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She broke the tradition to hold conferences, and expressed her opinions. This made her a target for political enemies but her sincerity of purpose made her personally popular to many. As she had written: ""...if truth and loyalty are stamped upon her face, all will be attracted to her..."" After the President Roosevelt's death in 1945, she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters, ""The story is over."" Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokeswoman in the United Nations. She continued a positive career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband."	['politics']
What's the author's attitude towards American culture?	American culture is unique because it is formed and developed under certain conditions. The major factors contributing to the making of this new nation and the forming of a new culture are the hard environment, ethnic diversity (;) and plural religion, which is quite different from other nations in the world. What is more, these elements are still influencing the American culture. The early immigrants who were English Puritans settled down in northeast part of America from 1607 to 1892. Frontiers were pushed further west. The frontiersmen looked for a land of rich resources and a land of promise, opportunity and freedom. Actually they looked for a better life. So individualism , self-reliance, and equality of opportunity have perhaps been the values most closely associated with the frontier heritage of America. In history, people from different countries in the world rushed to America three times. They brought their own culture to America and later on, different cultures were mixed together. Thus the unique American culture was formed, a common cultural life with commonly shared values. The fundamental American belief in individual freedom and the fight of individuals to practice their own religion is at the center of religious experience in the United States. The great diversity of ethnic backgrounds has produced religious pluralism ; almost all of the religions of the world are now practiced in the United States. Nowadays, we can see the continual influence of the three elements in the current American society. American family is typically parents and their unmarried children. Middle-aged and elderly people generally do not live with their married children. The people in America have a very strong desire to start a new life in a new place. Quite a number of people change residences every year. The average American moves fourteen times in his lifetime.	['He just states the facts.']
For how many days does Hanukkah last?	Hanukkah Hanukkah is a Jewish festival. It is celebrated on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev , which is usually sometime in December. It is often called the festival of lights. The festival celebrates the time, over 2,000 years ago, when the Jewish people fought against an emperor who would not let them follow their own traditions and religion. When the Jewish people won back their temple in Jerusalem, they found there was only enough holy oil to keep the sacred light burning for one day. However, to their surprise, this small amount of oil kept the light burning for eight days and nights, until the people had time to make more oil. At the center of the Hanukkah celebrations is a candlestick (called a Menorah) that holds nine candles. On the first night of Hanukkah the first candle is lit, and each day this candle is used to light another candle, until on the eighth day, the last day, all the candles are lit. During Hanukkah, people go to the synagogue to pray and to remember the miracle of the holy oil. Hanukkah is a time for family and friends to come together. People exchange gifts and greeting cards, and children go to parties. Parents often give their children money at Hanukkah. Potato cakes, called latkes, are a traditional Hanukkah food.	['8']
The purpose of the study done by Paul and his team was to .	"As a young man, Paul Beier hiked in the mountains of California. Since then, he has decided to choose his career as a wildlife protector. He went to school to learn more first of all. After he earned his doctor's degree, he eagerly signed up for a job studying cougars , which once lived throughout the United States, but now live mainly in the Rocky Mountains and westward. They need not only a lot of land to survive but also plenty of food and places to raise their young. But many wild areas have been divided by freeways and taken over by towns. The small wilderness areas of the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California didn't have much room for them. And yet a few still lived there. How did they do it? Many big animals are disappearing. Those that survive are being trapped in shrinking patches of habitat. A patch may not have enough space or food for a cougar to survive. Scientists wondered if cougars could move from one patch to another. If so, maybe humans could preserve wildlife corridors to connect the patches, providing enough room for the animals. But no one had shown that animals use wildlife corridors in real life. To see if cougars had found corridors through local suburbs and freeways, Paul and his research team studied 32 cougars for five years. They used a drug to make each cat sleep, buckled a radio collar around its neck, and let it go. Every day, Paul used an electrical device that sends and receives radio signals to find cougars, listening for radio beeps from their collars. Once or twice a week, he trailed one of the cougars all night. He traced their travels on a map. Sure enough, some of them had discovered paths from one small park land to the next. One cougar became famous for his travels. He was named M6:""M""for Male, and""6""because he was the sixth one collared in the study. M6's corner of the Santa Ana Mountains wasn't large enough for him. Chino Hills State Park was not far away, but the trip was not safe. After dark, M6 used a paved vehicle underground passage to cross undera busy eight-lane freeway. He slipped by a riding stable, and then picked his way through a golf course and across two sets of busy railroad tracks. Finally, he arrived in the sheltered canyons of 12,000-acre Chino Hills State Park. There, the cougar found deer to hunt. During a year and a half, the scientists recorded M6 making this journey 22 times! Then Paul learned of plans to build houses, gas stations, and a mall that would block M6's path. Paul once said,""The loss of this corridor would guarantee the extinction of the cougar from the Chino Hills and endanger the entire population of lions in the Santa Ana Mountains.""A local citizens' group called Hills for Everyone raised money to buy the land and add it to the state park. When the group visited the state capital and showed the map that Paul had made of M6's journeys, the lawmakers saw how important the corridor was. The lawmakers had the passage preserved, with the pavement removed and with native bushes near the openings. While traffic roared above, M6 and other cougars could move safely between the state park and the mountains. Other animals such as deer, foxes, and bobcats could also use the corridor. Paul's research showed that wildlife corridors can save animals. Since his study in the Santa Ana Mountains, scientists around the world have begun restoring and protecting wildlife corridors."

Which is the best title for the passage?	The earliest newspapers started in ancient Rome. They were handwritten news sheets. The first printed newspapers appeared in China during the Tang dynasty, which were printed from carved wooden blocks. Modern papers first appeared in Venice, Italy in the middle of the 14th century. The newspapers of today, with advertising and a mixture of political, economic, and social news and comments, were started in Britain in the mid-18th century. The main function of newspapers is to report news. Many newspapers also provide special information to readers, such as weather reports and television timetables. They also provide comments on politics, economics, arts and culture. Almost all newspapers depend on advertising to make money. Nearly six out of ten adults in the United States and Canada read a newspaper every day. Seven out of ten read a paper each weekend. Readers search newspapers for de-tailed background information and analysis . This is what television and radio news reports seldom offer. Newspapers tell readers what happened, and they also help readers understand what caused an event and how it will affect the world around them. The workers at large newspaper companies work under a lot of pressure to bring news to readers as soon as possible. Reporters, photographers, artists, and editors collect articles in just a few hours. Page designers select articles, photos, advertisements, and eye-catching headlines to make the pages, and then rush their work to the printer. Printing workers may work overnight around printing presses to _ more than 60,000 copies per hour.	['An Introduction to Newspapers']
The woman remembered his math teacher probably because _ .	"The man beside her looked familiar. She felt like she knew him. Then when he opened the book on his knees, she at once knew who he was. ""Now, if anyone ever has a doubt regarding factorisation , just once, read page number thirteen in your textbook. There would be no more doubt."" She smiled at the memory, remembering his patient, cool face. She recalled one by one, all the memories of her middle school Math teacher. He was a widower , always looking sad. He looked tailor-made for a librarian, silent as his books, or a romantic poet, but a mathematics teacher was the last guess anyone could make about him. Oh, how they used to make fun of him, play tricks on him and laugh behind his back! He never laughed but smiled politely at everybody. Sometimes he would make silly mistakes on the blackboard, and then apologize as he erased it out. He always gave in to the girls' demands of shortening his class. His correction was always careless and merciful , and the middle school girls relied on this fact to pass through the hardest of mathematics exam papers. But she didn't remember him for this. Long shiny hair and soulful big eyes. A tall, slim frame. His daughter. They had been best friends and always hung about together. She recalled eagerly all the fun they had in middle school, wild and carefree...until his daughter went down with pneumonia . She could never forget the suddenness and the meaninglessness of it, the feeling of emptiness. After that, he looked even sadder. But, life went on. Now, after almost 25 years, sitting beside him, with a dirty city bus aisle between them, she gathered her courage and said, ""Mr. Rao? I'm an old student of yours. You taught me in middle school."" He looked at her for a while. ""I do not even seem to remember any student."" She knew he was lying. ""I am sorry about your daughter."" There was a pause in their conversation, and it was filled with all kinds of noises. Then he spoke, looking away. ""I do not need any sympathy. In fact, all my new students think I never had any kids."" He had a smile, but his eyes were sad. ""Where do you work now?"" she asked. ""Future Generation High School."" She swallowed, in excitement. The school where her daughter studied. ""Do you happen to know Jaya Kumari?"" Something flashed across his face. Anyone else would consider the expression as recalling something. But she knew it was pain. Then his face was calm again. ""No."" His answer was short. ""Well, she is my daughter."" Her daughter was a topper, a gold medalist in the Math State Competitions. He was pretending. The bus stopped. She stood up and looked down at him. ""I was your daughter's best friend. You must surely remember me..."" ""Excuse me,"" he said, looking nervous. ""I do not want this conversation. Someday, you'll see that it is easier to bury the past."" He said, and went back to his graph. ""Her loss was hard on me too,"" she continued calmly. ""I named my daughter after her."""	['they both suffered the loss of loved ones']
Why did the author look closely at her mother's friend's face?	"About 12 years ago, I began making a series of dolls called ""Wee Mountain Folk."" At first, I made them from cloth but then began using a kind of polymer clay called cernit. The cloth dolls were beautiful, but it was impossible to get the level of detail I can get with clay. First, I use wire to build the shape of the doll. Then I cover the head, hands, and feet around the wire using the cernit. Then I make the doll's clothes myself, using lots of different materials. The completed dolls are fixed onto hardwood bases made by my father, Jim Logan. Generally, the dolls I make show older people taking part in traditional activities. I've always had a great respect for the older generation. Inspiration for the dolls often comes from people I know. Once I was caught looking too closely at the wrinkles on the face of one of my mom's friends. But I explained that her laugh lines made her more attractive. Now I work as a teacher's assistant, and while I was raising my two daughters, Keri and Sheryl, I could work on the dolls only late in the day. The girls loved to come downstairs the next morning to see who'd arrived in the night. It's the detail that I enjoy working on the most. I once made a fisherman doll for a lady to give her father, including a tiny creel -- a basket used by fishermen for carrying fish. When the man got the doll, he immediately opened the creel to see what was inside. Luckily, I'd made a small fish out of cernit and placed it in the basket. Hopefully my story will inspire others to try their hand at doll making -- I find it very relaxing and interesting."	['To get creative ideas.']
We pay attention to our body language because _ .	The impression you make at the beginning of an interview is very important. Employers often decide to hire someone in the first three minutes of the interview. They judge you by your appearance, attitude and manners. A friendly smile when you walk into the room is important. A smile shows a confident and positive attitude. When you introduce yourself, make eye contact with the interviewer. Some interviewers offer a handshake. Others don't. Try to be as natural as possible. But pay attention to your body language. The way you sit, walk, gesture, use your voice and show feelings on your face is all part of your body language. It makes the interviewer know how you feel about yourself and the situation you are in. Are you feeling positively about yourself? Your abilities? Your interest in the job? Speak clearly and loudly enough. Show interest and enthusiasm in your voice. When you speak, look at the interviewer. Also, don't say negative things about yourself, or former employer. Listen to questions carefully. If you don't understand a question, ask the interviewer to repeat or explain politely. Almost everyone is nervous in a job interview. Interviewers know that. They don't expect you to be totally calm and relaxed. But they expect you to try to control your nervousness. They expect you to show confidence in your ability to do the job. At the end of the interview, thank the interviewer for her or his time. It's a good idea to send a short thank-you letter right after the interview, or deliver it by hand. Phone the company if you have not heard anything after one week. Ask if they have made a decision about the job. Good luck!	"[""it can help us win the employer's impression""]"
The weather report is _ right.	"In Britain, people usually begin their talks with weather. For example, they will say""It's a fine day, isn't it?""""Do you think it will rain?"" Many people believe that they are able to tell what the weather will be like. But they never agree with each other. One man may say, ""How cloudy it is now! It's going to rain."" Another man will say, ""No, it's going to be fine later."" People always hope the weather they want. For example, when a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain. When a man wants to travel, he is sure the weather will be fine quickly. Now almost everyone listens to the weather report. It doesn't always tell us the weather we want, it only tells us what the weather will be like. But sometimes it makes mistakes . ,."	['not always']
What should we do if we follow the author's second suggestion?	When asked to point out one or two things that are most important to themselves, many put friends ahead of homes, jobs, clothes and cars. A true friendship carries a long history of experience that determines who we are and keeps us connected. It is a treasure we should protect. Unfortunately, the better friends you are, the more probably you'll have disagreements. And the result can be what you don't want--an end to the relationship. The good news is that most troubled friendships can be mended. First, don't let your pride get in your way. Most of us can forgive each other when differences are brought out in the open. Second, apologize when you're wrong -- even if you've been wronged. Over the course of a friendship, even the best people make mistakes. Sometimes, it may be best if the _ takes the lead and apologizes. When you apologize, give your friend a chance to admit that he has been wrong. Third, see things from your friend's point of view. And finally, accept that friendships change as our needs and lifestyle change. Making friends can sometimes seem easy. The hard part is keeping the connections strong during the natural ups and downs that have an effect on all relationships. My suggestion: consider friendship as an honor and a gift, and worth the effort to treasure and nurture .	['Make an apology first.']
From the passage, we can learn that _ .	"A 14-year-old British student is packing for the next day of school: textbooks, notebooks, pens, 250 grams of flour, an egg and some cooking oil. Wait, what? It's not a joke. From September, cookery will be a compulsory course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. ""One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone. Only four out of ten of us enjoy eating meals with our children,"" British writer Joanna Blythman wrote in her book Bad Food Britain: How A Nation Ruined Its Appetite in 2006. Instead, ready meals have become the first choice for many British kids, because their parents are often too busy to cook a proper meal. The Department for Education hopes that the cookery courses can introduce children to good food and reduce childhood _ . ""It's important that children can develop an interest and understanding of good food,"" said a spokesman for the department. ""We want to encourage them to develop a love of food and cooking that will stay with them as they grow up."	['many British people have unhealthy eating habits']

According to the passage, we can know that dealing with peer pressure is _	"It is reasonable to say that every teenager can be affected by peer pressure at some point. Every day, in any high school, peer pressure has a major influence over the behavior of teenagers. It can be as subtle as being persuaded to be late for class or as extreme as a dangerous drug. Whether subtle or extreme, peer pressure can have damaging, sometimes life changing, and even serious results. ""Teens don't often consider the long-term results that some behavior can cause,"" said Terri Price, a researcher. ""Peer pressure can be very difficult to handle for many teens because of their fears of not fitting in"". Peer pressure has always been part of teen life, but teens experience _ differently than their former generations did in the past. Sources of peer pressure have increased because of the Internet and other electronic communications. Recognizing peer pressure can be as simple as noticing that you have been asked to do something that you are not comfortable with.

Which of the following is NOT TRUE ?	In the 13th century, the Italian traveler, Marco polo , traveled a long way to China , During his stay in China , he saw many wonderful things . One of the things he discovered was that the Chinese used paper money . In western countries , people did not use paper money until the 15th century . However , people in China began to use paper money in the 7th century . A Chinese man called CaiLun invented paper almost 2000 years ago. He made it from wood . He took the wood from trees and made it into paper . He then put these pieces of paper together and made them into a book . Now paper still comes from trees . We use a lot of paper every day ! If we keep on wasting so much paper , there will not be any trees on the earth . If there are no trees , there will be no paper . Every day , people throw away about 2800 tons of paper in our city . It takes 17 trees to make one ton of paper . This means that we are cutting nearly 48000 trees every day . Since it takes more than 10 years for a tree to grow , we must start using less paper now . If we don't , we will not have enough time to grow more trees to take the place of those we use for paper . So how can we save paper ? We can use both sides of every piece of paper , especially when we are making notes .We can choose drinks in bottles instead of those in paper packets . We can also use cotton handkerchiefs and not paper ones . When we go shopping , we can use fewer paper bags . If the shop assistant does give us a paper bag, we can save it and reuse it later . Everyone can help to save paper . If we all think carefully , we can help protect trees . But we should do it now , before it is too late .	['It is never too late to plant trees for paper .']

Which of the following words can best describe the museums?	"Here's the travel plan for some museums on our ""Museums of the World"" tour. The Museum of Bad Art (Boston, USA) shows what it describes as ""art too bad to be ignored"". The museum hopes to bring the worst of art to the widest possible audience and has even published a book of its most ""important"" works. As part of the visit, we'll be shown some truly awful portraits, landscapes and sculptures. The Washington Banana Museum (Auburn, Washington, USA) contains 4,000 objects related to the history of what the museum describes as ""the world's most perfect fruit"". We'll be given a guided tour around the museum, during which we'll learn all sorts of interesting things, such as the fact that bananas were introduced to the USA in 1878 in the same exhibition as Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, and that the banana is now the US' number-one selling fruit. The Hair Museum (Avanos, Turkey) is located in a cave in Cappadocia, in Central Anatolia. It contains 160,000 samples of people's hair. You'll be offered a chance to add your own hair to the collection. Later in the year, the museum curator selects 10 donors to attend a pottery workshop. If you're one of them, you'll be invited to stay in his guest house. The museum du Slip (Brussels, Belgium) is devoted to underwear. The idea behind the museum is that everyone is equal in their underwear. You'll be fascinated to know that it has collected samples from all sorts of people, including artists, politicians and pop stars. The Museum de Carrosses Funebres (Barcelona, Spain) is a museum of funeral hearses . It takes a look at how local people have been transported to their funerals since the 19th century. During the tour, we'll be provided with a fascinating insight into how the people of Barcelona viewed death. Among the 1,000 or so exhibits, pride of place goes to a ""flap-coffin"", which is a reusable coffin from the 18th century."	['Unusual']
Why does Haagen-Dazs seldom do television advertising? _	"Haagen-Dazs from Europe started in 1989 and is 5-10 times more expensive than regular ice cream. There is no real advantage. However, it adopted a unique marketing strategy, and quickly occupied the market as a top ice cream brand. Haagen-Dazs did not set up shops in ordinary supermarkets or grocery stores. Haggen-Dazs leisure fashion shops are located in busy sections of malls. The layout is carefully planned to create an elegant atmosphere, and sometimes, a flagship store will cost several million dollars. Compared to other ice cream brands, Haagen-Dazs consumers are tightly grouped. It is understood that Haagen-Dazs seldom does television advertising. The majority of advertisements are high impact visually in print advertisements. In particular many advertisements target the wealthy consumers. Moreover, if the consumer spends 500 Yuan they can become a member. These members will be regularly sent advertisements by direct mail. Praise of customers is a powerful weapon. There is always much creative ingenuity in Haagen-Dazs advertising, so it is remembered by the people: initial advertisements such as: ""Delicious Haagen-Dazs, like 24K gold, Kobe beef from Japan, original palm oil, mushroom truffles and Chinese ceramics...what 'ice cream'was waiting for."" ""love her, let her eat Haagen-Dazs"" This classic advertisement attracted numerous Haagen-Dazs lovers who became regulars. Today, Haggen-Dazs has about 700 stores in 55 countries with annual sales of more than 1 billion US dollars. Haagen-Dazs has become the world's most popular ice cream brand. In the United States, its market share is 6.1%, 1%in France, 4.6% in Japan, 4% in Singapore, and 5% in Hong Kong. Determined to win the majority of wealthy customers they combined positioning in the marketplace with dedicated brand goals. This is the real secret of success."

Which of the following would be the best title for this passage?	"Robert Kohout, 39, was working outside his home last October when he heard a frightening noise. He turned round and saw Walter Graham's car sinking into 8 feet of water of the inground swimming pool a little distance away from his yard. Kohout immediately called to Graham's wife, Evelyn, to phone 911. Then he ran back to his house to get Terence Reif and Glenn Fajardo to help, who were at work inside the house. ""There was no time for second thoughts,"" said Reif, a farmer's son. ""The only thing to do is to get in the pool."" The car doors were locked. Graham, 73, was unconscious, and his was rapidly filling with water. Reif struggled to break the driver's side window with a hammer but had trouble getting it done underwater. Finally, some four minutes after the car had fallen into the pool, the glass was broken. By then, Graham was floating at the top of the flooded passenger compartment. The three men pulled Graham out through the broken glass. He wasn't breathing and his heart stopped beating, so they performed mouth-to-mouth . The rescue team arrived in no time. Doctors supplied him with advanced life support on the way to the hospital. ""These people were getting to Graham through the glass,"" said Dr. Jeff. ""All three acted without regard for their own safety."" Added Evelyn Graham, ""they were truly angels, watching over us""."	['Angels around Us']
Which word best describes the author's attitude toward walking?	"One important attraction of walking is its long-lasting appeal. Whereas jogging and aerobic dancing can _ quickly, walking provides a popular activity that seems to endure. Fitness foundations estimate that 35 million adult Americans walk for exercise every day, with at least 15 million walking two or three times a week. Among the most regular walkers are those 65 years and older--evidence that walking is an exercise that lasts. In addition to its many physical benefits, walking, like other physical activities, has a comforting effect on the psyche. Walking can help you to think more clearly and feel more relaxed. It also can be a sociable activity. An early morning walk around the neighborhood provides an opportunity to chat with friends or simply admire the flowers. Or because it does not require a team or even a partner, walking is something you can do on your own time, by yourself, whenever the mood strikes. Easily affordable, all you need to start walking is enthusiasm and a pair of comfortable and sturdy low-heeled shoes. Dr.ChristineL. Wells recommends an Oxford-style shoe with ties for better foot support; she does not recommend sneakers or other ""cheapies"". If you plan to walk regularly, you might want to invest in a pair of so-called walking shoes. If so, expect to spend at least $35. For walking during the hotter months, early morning or evening hours are best. Clothes should fit loosely and be lightweight and light-colored. Elderly walkers should consider wearing long sleeves, and all Arizonans need to be particularly concerned about skin cancer. Dr. Wells suggests wearing sunscreen as well as a side-brimmed hat to protect your eyes, ears, nose and back of the neck. Walkers also should drink an adequate amount of water. Wells advises drinking an 8-ounce glass of water before you start out, and more when you return. ""If you walk four miles or more a day in Arizona, I also recommend that you carry a water bottle,"" she says. "" And water is just fine; you don't need those fluid-replacement or electrolyte drinks."""	['positive']
The best title of this passage should be _ .	"My Uncle Dave posed an interesting question to my wife and me when he came to visit us the other day. He asked: ""What do you think the world will be like in 50 or 100 years, in terms of technology and society and so on?"" He says he asks many of the people he meets this question to see what their thoughts are. His point is that no one really knows. I mean, in 1945, could people have even imagined surfing the net or sending e-mails as we do? No way. And the pace of technological innovation is incredible . We're on a more different curve than we used to be. One thing I'm looking forward to is real software agents. There is so much information out there, but I want something that can help me find what I really want. For instance, in about ten years, I think, there will be no longer recorded music, and there will be some big databases from which you can download music onto your hard drive or whatever. At that point, there will be so much music to choose from and you'll be able to sample things before you buy them. But the question will be how I find what I'm looking for and how I do find the music that might interest me. Or more generally, how do I find information that I want without spending all the time myself surfing the net? How do I find people who are like-minded , with whom I might really want to communicate? I want to find those people but it's hard to do. In the future I think that one will be able to build a community of like-minded people who live all over the globe. It's going to be very interesting, I think."	['What the Future Will Be Like']
If you talk with an American friend, it's polite to _ .	"Sometimes people add to what they say even when they don't talk. Gestures are the ""silent language"" of every culture. We point a finger or move another part of the body to show what we want to say. It is important to know the body language of every country or we may be misunderstood. In the United States, people greet each other with a handshake in a formal introduction. The handshake must be firm. If the handshake is weak, it is a sign of weakness or unfriendliness. Friends may place a hand on the other's arm or shoulder. Some people, usually women, greet a friend with a hug . Space is important to Americans. When two people talk to each other, they usually stand about two and a half feet away and at an angle, so they are not facing each other directly. Americans get uncomfortable when a person stands too close. They will move back to have their space. If Americans touch another person by accident, they say, ""Pardon me."" or ""Excuse me."" Americans like to look the other person in the eyes when they are talking. If you don't do so, it means you are bored, hiding something, or are not interested. But when you stare at someone, it is not polite. For Americans, thumbs-up means yes, very good, or well done. Thumbs-down means the opposite. To call a waiter, raise one hand to head level or above. To show you want the check, make a movement with your hands as if you are singing a piece of paper. It is all right to point at things but not at people with the hand and index finger . Americans shake their index finger at children when they scold them and pat them on the head when they admire them. Learning a culture's body language is sometimes confusing. If you don't know what to do, the safest thing to do is to smile."	['look at the other person in the eyes']

But to my surprise, the waiters still kept on serving more. Then a waiter found out the reason. He helped me turn the sign over, with red outside .

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"One bitterly cold day, a snowstorm blew into our area. Needing firewood, I quickly set out with my best friend, Bruce, to look for a tree to cut down. I was glad to have Bruce along. Cutting down a tree in a snowstorm can be dangerous. So it was important to have a friend who could warn me of dangers. When I chose a big 23-meter-tall tree and prepared to cut it down, my best friend suddenly warned me, ""Don't cut down that tree! It's too close to the power line!"" I wasn't sure about it. So I decided to _ his warning. I wanted to finish the job quickly and go home. So I began cutting down the tree. When the tree fell, there was no longer any doubt that my friend was right. The tree caught the power line, bringing it to the ground. I considered cutting the tree off the line. After all, electricity can't travel through wood, so I could safely remove the tree. As I reached out my finger to touch the tree, pain ran up my arm and through my head. I had been shocked! After I returned home and told my mother what had happened, she quickly called the power company. Workers from the power company soon arrived on the scene. One of them asked if I had touched the tree, and when I told him I had, his face turned pale. ""You should have been killed,"" he said. So why am I still alive? It was my boots that saved my life. Within two hours, the workers removed the tree. Soon the snowstorm calmed down--but not my mother. Even though she was glad I wasn't hurt, my mother was well serious with me. After all, I shouldn't have brushed off my friend's warning. Through this experience, I learned that it's important to listen to people who offer a different perspective . Taking the time to listen might actually save a lot of time and trouble. It certainly would have kept me from getting the ""shock of my life""."	['The writer knew nothing about electricity.']

Which of the following statements is TRUE according to Tamsin Smith?	"European Day of Languages falls on 26 September. BBC News Online reported the attitudes across several European Union countries to languages. Tamsin Smith, Rome, Italy Italians place very high importance on learning languages, particularly English. Twenty years ago it was quite difficult to find an English speaker here but today it is quite easy. The strong influence of American and English culture helps young people to learn the English language. They often become familiar with it through ""Harry Potter"" books or Disney movies. English schools, where Italian children are taught all their lessons in English, are also becoming popular among rich Italians. Lucien Libert, Paris, France Languages are very important in France. A good knowledge of the English language is necessary for many Frenchmen to get a good job and the more languages you can learn, the better. English is the first language you learn in school and you start very young. Most people have at least eight years of learning English at school. Learning German or Spanish comes next and Latin is also taught in most schools. While French people learn languages, there is also a movement to protect the French language. James Helm, Dublin, Ireland The English language predominates in Ireland, but the ancient Irish language is a lasting source of pride and interest, and it remains a living tongue that is used in several areas. School are required to teach ancient Irish, and most students learn it as part of the subjects. There is a continuing discussion about how to protect the language best. In recent years some primary schools have introduced foreign language classes for younger students, and the Irish government has tried to encourage schools to offer more languages such as French, Spanish, German and Italian."

What can be inferred from what Stuart Miles said?	"A developer edition of Sony's augmented reality smart glasses will go on sale in ten countries next month, the tech giant has announced. Pre-orders for the SmartEyeglass, costing $840 (PS620), are now being taken in the UK and Germany, with Japan and the US to follow shortly. The black-framed glasses are compatible with recent Android operating systems. Last month Google announced that it was withdrawing its smart glasses for redevelopment. Sony's initial model will come with a software development kit to encourage people to design apps for it, the company said. The glasses, which weigh 77g, contain an accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, image and brightness sensors, 3-megapixel camera and a microphone. They also come with a controller, designed to be attached to clothing, which contains a speaker, touch sensor and the device's battery. Text is displayed in front of the wearer in monochrome green. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has been open about his dislike of glasses as a wearable device. ""We always thought that glasses were not a smart move, from a point of view that people would not really want to wear them,"" he told the New Yorker. ""They were intrusive , instead of pushing technology to the background, as we've always believed."" Stuart Miles, founder of tech site Pocket-lint, said: ""I think [Sony is] wasting their time, energy and effort."" ""Google Glass obviously needed a complete rethink... I can't see how something thick-rimmed and more invasive-looking than Google Glass is going to catch on.

The main purpose of the passage is to _ .	"We are naturally drawn to friends and colleagues with familiar voices, scientists have found.People prefer those who have a similar accent,intonation and tone of voice to themselves , they discovered. Previous research has focused on how masculine or feminine a voice sounds.Men with deeper voices and women with slightly higher voices were thought to sound more attractive,because they suggest a bigger or a smaller body. But the new study,published by a linguistics expert in Canada,suggests there is a more complex mechanism at play.Dr Molly Babel, from the University of British Columbia in Canada, said,""The voice is an amazingly flexible tool that we use to construct our identity.Very few things in our voices are changeless,so we felt that our preferences had to be about more than a person's shape and size.'' She recorded 30 volunteers' voices and asked each to rate the others' attractiveness on a scale of one to nine.Each participant was from western America,with similar accents.The people we assessed were all in the same dialect group,but they showed that dialect to different degrees. ""We seem to like people who sound like we sound,we like people who fit within what we know,""Dr Babel said.She also found that breathy voices in women-typified by the famous American actress Marilyn Monroe-were seen as more attractive. The breathy tone,caused by younger and thinner vocal cords ,implied youthfulness and health A creaky voice,suggesting a person has a cold,is tired or smokes,was seen as unattractive.The participants preferred men who spoke with a shorter average word length and deeper voices. The linguist,whose work is published in the journal PLOS One,said,""Once you're outside of a certain range of familiarity,novel and exotic sounding voices might become more attractive.We also have to keep in mind we find some accents more preferable than others because of social fixed ideas."""

Which statement about a hurricane is wrong?	In the second half of each year, many powerful storms are born in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean seas. Of these, only about half a dozen becomes the strong, circling winds of 75 miles per hour or more that are called hurricanes, and several usually make their way to the coast. There they cause millions of dollars of damage, and bring death to large numbers of people. The great storms that hit the coast start as soft circling wind hundreds -- even thousands -- of miles out to sea. As they travel aimlessly over water warmed by the summer sun, they are carried westward by the southeast winds. When conditions are just right, warm, moist air flows in at the bottom of such a wind, moves upward through it and comes out at the top. In the process , the moisture in this warm air produces rain, and with it the heat is changed to energy in the form of strong winds. As the heat increases, the young hurricane begins to move in a counter-clockwise motion . The life of a hurricane is only about nine days, but it contains almost more power than we can imagine. The energy in the heat released by a hurricane's rainfall in a single day would satisfy the entire electrical needs of the United States for more than six months. Water, not wind, is the main source of death and destruction in a hurricane. A typical hurricane brings 6 to 12 inch downpours, causing sudden floods. Worst of all is the powerful movement of the sea -- the mountains of water moving toward the hurricane center. The water level rises as much as 15 feet above normal as it moves toward shore.	['It sometimes brings the sea water level to the height of 15 feet.']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"China's top labor official said the country is planning to push back the age at which workers can retire. Yin Weimin, minister of human resources and social security, demonstrated that we did not put a timetable on the move when he spoke about it during a forum at the weekend. ""Delaying the retirement age is a very complicated issue and we will study it according to the situations of population and employment and consider different groups of people,"" Yin said. He noted that _ in the retirement age have been brought in by many countries and can be a good way to deal with an aging population and ensure the healthy and stable development of social security. The life expectancy of Chinese people is now 73 years and is expected to rise to 74 during the next five years, he said. Nearly three out of 10 Chinese people will be older than 60 by 2040, according to a United Nations forecast. The retirement age in China currently is 60 for men and 55 for female civil servants and 50 for female workers. The idea of delaying the retirement age is being widely supported by government officials, while many laborers and non-government employees were less enthusiastic about the prospect of working for longer. Currently, they have to pay into their pension plans for at least 15 years before they can retire. Chen Xianlian, a female worker at a motorcycle parts manufacturer in Chongqing municipality is among those who would like to see the retirement age left as it is. ""I have to do lots of tough and repetitive work every day and I feel very tired after my working day,"" the 41-year-old said. ""All my colleagues are discussing the government's possible move to lift the retirement age. None of us wants to work any extra years."" University graduates also fear that any rise in the retirement age could limit their employment opportunities."	['China is probably going to delay the retirement age']
Who is more likely to die of cancer according to the passage?	Findings from a new study were presented at a recent meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society. Researchers in the United States studied 100,000 women during an eight-year period, beginning in 1994. All of the women were fifty or older. The study was part of the Women's Health Initiative organized by the National Institutes of Health. The women were asked questions measuring their beliefs or ideas about the future. The researchers attempted to identify each woman's personality eight years after gathering the information. The study found that hopeful individuals were 14% less likely than other woman to have died from any cause. The hopeful women were also 30 less likely to have died from heart disease after the eight years, Hilary Tinkle from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania was the lead author of the report. She said the study confirmed earlier research that linked optimistic feelings to longer life. The researchers also gathered information about people's education, financial earnings, physical activity and use of alcohol or cigarettes. Independent of those things, the findings still showed that optimists had less of a chance of dying during the eight-year period. Some women who answered the questions were found to be hostile , or highly untrusting of others. These women were 16% more likely to die than the others. They also were 23% more likely to die of cancer. The study also found women who were not optimistic were more likely to smoke and have high blood pressure or diabetes. They were also more likely mot to exercise. Tindle says the study did not confirm whether optimism leads to healthier choices, or if it actually affects a person's physical health. She also says the study does not prove that negative emotions or distrust lead to bad health effects and shorter life. Yet there does appear to be a link that calls for more research.

In deep icy waters under Antarctica, scientists found bulbous tunicates, an underground animal, and many newly-discovered creatures believed to be related to starfish and other marine creatures. Elsewhere in the world's oceans, they have recently discovered many kinds of underwater life forms new to science. It is all part of a research effort called the Census of Marine Life. ""There are about 2,000 scientists worldwide involved,"" said Bob Gagosian, President, CEO of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. Gagosian helps manage the project. ""Everywhere they've gone they've found new things,"" he says. ""The ocean basically is unexplored from the point of view of marine living things."" Researchers have placed small markers on hundreds of fish and marine animals to track by satellite their migration routes and to discover places where sea life gathers. According to Ron O'Dor, a senior scientist with the Census of Marine Life, knowledge of life on the ocean floor is especially limited. ""90% of all the information we have is from the top hundred meters of the ocean,"" O'Dor states. And he says the sea floor is, on average, at a depth of 4, 000 meters. And so, as some machines dive far below what people have previously seen, scientists are discovering new species of plants, animals and living things. Since the census project began, more than 5,300 new marine animals have been found. Ocean researchers say they hope to catalogue 230,000 species during the census --which some say is only a small part of all the creatures living in the sea."

It is _ that makes you itch.	No matter who you are or where you come from, one thing is certain: you are familiar to the mosquito, although you probably wish you weren't. Mosquitoes are everywhere. They can be found all over the world, and they come in more than 2,500 species . Somewhere, at some time, you have surely met at least one. No one loves the mosquito. But unfortunately, the mosquito may decide who she loves. She? Yes, she. Do you know that only the female mosquito bites? Well, it's true. And it's not because she is unfriendly; she needs blood to reproduce. Do you know how the female mosquito decides whom to bite? She is quite selective, and she chooses her victims carefully. First, she uses sensors to find her victim. These sensors are located on her two antennae and her three pairs of legs. With these sensors, she tests your body moisture, body warmth, and chemical substances in your sweat. If she likes what she finds, she bites. But if you are not attractive, she'll reject you for another one. The next time a mosquito bites you, just remember that you are chosen. You are special. If the mosquito likes you, she settles onto your flesh very gently, and she breaks your skin with her long nose tip. Long nose tip? What's that? It's a kind of mouth and it sticks out just below the mosquito's eyes. It contains six sharp instruments called styles. She thrusts all six styles into your skin at once, and if she hits a blood pipe, she'll get a full dinner in about a minute. All this usually takes place so quickly and quietly that you may not have doubted anything is happening. Why does a mosquito bite itch ? The itch is not really from the bite. lt's from the saliva the mosquito mixes with your blood to keep it from being blocked as she sucks up her long nose tip. By the time the itch begins, she has gone. And then what happens? Well after her delicious dinner, the mosquito is tired. She just wants to find a place to rest. Heavy with your blood, she picks a spot on a leaf, a wall or a stone to quietly lay her eggs. Just one drop of blood will produce hundreds of eggs.	['her saliva']
Edison _ at Christmas in 1871 in American.	"At Christmas,1871,Edison,the famous American scientist,got married to Mary. Lots of their friends came to their wedding ceremony . At about two in the afternoon,Edison suddenly thought out a good way to solve the problem on the automatic telegraph after the wedding. So he said to the bride ,""I'll have to go to the factory because I have something important to do. Then I'll come back to have dinner with you.""The bride had no way but to agree. On the night of the festival, other families were full of joy while the bride stayed in the house alone,just looking out of the window. How lonely she was! A worker went into the lab and said as soon as he saw Edison, ""My goodness! I have never seen a bride-groom like you. It's already twelve now!""Edison was greatly surprised. ""Twelve? Too bad! I said I would have dinner with Mary."" he said as he ran downstairs. That's how hard Edison worked.He gave all his life to the invention of lights, films and over two thousand other things. A new invention came into being every fifteen days."	['got married to Mary']
When the fire arose in the middle of the night, the author was _ .	"""Fire! Fire!"" What terrible words to hear when one wakes up in a strange house in the middle of the night! It was a large, old, wooden house and my room was on the top floor. I jumped out of bed, opened the door and stepped outside the house. There was full of thick smoke. I began to run, but as I was still only half-awake, instead of going towards the stairs I went in the opposite direction. The smoke grew thicker and I could see fire all around. The floor became hot under my bare feet. I found an open door and ran into a room to get to the window. But before I could reach it, one of my feet caught in something soft and I fell down. The thing I had fallen over felt like a bundle of clothes, and I picked it up to protect my face from the smoke and heat. Just then the floor gave way under me and I crashed to the floor below with pieces of burning wood all around me. I saw a doorway in fire, then I put the bundle over my face and ran. My feet burned me terrible, but I got through. As I reached the cold air outside, my bundle of clothes gave a thin cry, I nearly dropped it in my surprise. Then I was in a crowd gathered in the street. A woman in a night-dress and a borrowed man's coat screamed as she saw me and came running madly. She was the Mayor's wife, and I had saved her baby."

What can we learn form the passage?	"One day in spring four men were riding on horseback along a country road. These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to attend court. There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping from the trees, and the grass was wet. The four lawyers rode along, one behind another, for the pathway was narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and talked and laughed and were very cheerful. As they were passing through a group of small trees, they heard a great fluttering over their heads and a weak sound made by small birds in the grass by the roadside. ""Stith! Stith! Stith!"" came from the leafy branches above them. ""Cheep! cheep! cheep!"" came from the wet grass. ""What is the matter here?"" asked the first lawyer, whose name was Speed. ""Oh, it's only some old robins !""said the second lawyer, whose name was Hardin. ""The storm has blown two of the little ones out of the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is worried about them."" ""What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass,"" said the third lawyer. ""Oh, well! They're nothing but birds,"" said Mr. Hardin. ""Why should we bother?"" ""Yes, why should we?"" said Mr. Speed. The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying about, and crying to her mate. Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. In a few minutes they had forgotten about the birds. But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big warm hands. They did not seem frightened, but cried softly, as if they knew they were safe. ""Never mind, my little fellows,"" said Mr. Lincoln ""I will put you in your own cozy little bed."" Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was high, much higher than he could reach. But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm little home. Two other baby birds were there that had not fallen out. All cuddled down together and were very happy. Soon the three lawyers who had ridden ahead stopped at a spring to give their horses water. ""Where is Lincoln?"" asked one. All were surprised to find that he was not with them. ""Do you remember those birds?"" said Mr. Speed. ""Very likely he has stopped to take care of them."" In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln joined them. His shoes were covered with mud; he had torn his coat on the thorny tree. ""Hello, Abraham!"" said Mr. Hardin. ""Where have you been?"" ""I stopped a minute to give those birds to their mother,"" he answered. ""Well, we always thought you were a hero,"" said Mr. Speed. ""Now we know it."" Then all three of them laughed heartily. They thought it so foolish that a strong man should take so much trouble just for some worthless young birds. ""Gentlemen,"" said Mr. Lincoln, ""I could not have slept tonight, if I had left those helpless little robins to die in the wet grass."" Abraham Lincoln afterwards became very famous as a lawyer and statesman. He was elected president. Next to Washington he was the greatest."	['Abraham Lincoln was a kind-hearted great man.']
Why did the author want to buy the farm in a hurry?	At a certain time in our lives we consider every place as the possible site for a house.I have thus searched the country within a dozen miles of where I live.In imagination I have bought all the farms, one after another, and I knew their prices. The nearest thing that I came to actual ownership was when I bought the Hollowell place.But before the owner completed the sale with me, his wife changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me additional dollars to return the farm to him.However, I let him.keep the additional dollars and sold him the farm for just what I gave for it. The real attraction of' the Hollowell farm to me was its position, being about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, bounded on one side by the river, and separated from highway by a wide field. The poor condition if the house and fences showed that it hadn't been used for some time.I remembered from my earliest trip up the river that the house used to be hidden behind a forest area, and I was in a hurry to buy it before the owner finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the apple trees, and clearing away some young trees which had grown up in the fields.I wanted to buy it before he made any more of his improvements.But it turned out as I have said. I was not really troubled by _ .I had always had a.garden, but I don't think I was ready for a large farm. I believe that as long as possible it is better to live free and uncommitted .It makes but little difference you own a farm or not.	['He wanted to keep the farm as it was.']

The main idea of the story is that _	""" Dreams may be more important than sleep. We all need to dream."" some scientists say. Dreams take up about one quarter of our sleeping time. People have several dreams each night. Dreams are like short films. They are usually in color. Some dreams are like old films. They come up over and over again. That may be the dreamer worrying about something. Dreaming may be a way of trying to find an answer. Some people get new ideas about their work from dreams. They may have been thinking about their work all day. These thoughts can carry over into dreams. Too much dreaming can be harmful. The more we sleep,the longer we dream. The mind is still at work when we dream. That is why we may have a long sleep and still wake up tired."	['what dream is']
From the passage, we can infer _	"""Hey, little boy, will you support me when I'm getting old?"" Wang Wenshan, 35, asked his newborn baby as he picked him up at home. The Chinese tradition of raising sons to support parents in their old age has been weakened by the rapidly growing economy and improving standard of living. As is the case with more and more developed countries, China faces an aging society. People are living longer and having fewer children. Therefore, many Chinese families are falling into a 4-2-1 family pattern: a couple raises one child and supports four elderly parents. But few realize that a problem is likely to happen ahead. The aging of the population is a trend that now affects a growing number of countries. Not long ago, the Information Office of the State Council, China's cabinet, issued a white paper on measures China is taking to help its elderly population. The paper said China's population entered the aging period at the end of the 20thcentury and the proportion of people aged 60 and above accounted for over 10 percent of the entire population. By the end of 2005, China had nearly 144 million people over 60, accounting for 11 percent of population, according to the white paper. An expanding aged population _ means that many issues must be settled, as the problem concerns every aspect of society. It puts more pressure on each family, causing disturbing economic consequences and serious social problems. It also challenges the labor force supply and the pension system. ""I used to think that it's not an issue for me to provide for the aged,"" said Wang, whose parents and parents-in-law all enjoy pensions and medical insurance. But last year Wang's father suffered a serious illness and afterward Wang began to feel the pressure on his shoulders. After his father recovered, Wang opened bank accounts for each parent and deposited some money into the account every month to prepare for future uncertainties. In addition, he has to save money every month to provide for his son's future education. ""I'm now breaking my back working to support my family: saving pensions for the parents, my son's education funds, and living costs."" Wang also bought some commercial old-age insurance for himself. ""We have to take precautions before it is too late, and many of my colleagues share the same view,"" he said."	['the aging people problem is one of the concerns for the Chinese government']
The main reason why the author doesn't give information about whom Aunt Bet is visiting in the attic is to make the _ .	"Wide awake in Aunt Bet's Southern house, Annie Van Lew shivered at the sounds of distant guns. It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close. _ .Annie sat up in bed and listened.Had a stranger broken in? Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby. Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other. Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . Annie followed closely behind. In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. A thin man stepped out of the opening. As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze. Desperately shaking her head ""no"", the girl raised one finger to her lips. The officer understood and shifted his look. Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring. Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely. Smiling, he said,""What trouble you should have gotten into if your aunt had turned around!"" That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North. The girl chatted as she dared, wishing her new friend luck when he said he would leave at dawn. Back in her room, Annie felt proud and was determined to guard her family's secret to the end."

Why did the kids want to wash others' cars for free?	"Last weekend, my kids along with a few other kids from the neighborhood volunteered to help me wash my car. My 10-year-old daughter came up with the idea of washing other people's cars as well. It was pretty hot outside. She further wanted to give juice for a low cost but not free. I felt happy and decided to help her. She asked me, ""What if we make this 'a smile car wash', mommy? ""I couldn't hold back my tears and encouraged her and other kids to go inside the house and come up with ideas. While I kept myself busy in drying the car, the kids walked up to me with a board of beautiful signs of smiles. They had ""Free Car Wash"" written on it and the theme of their exercise was ""Smile"". It was pretty natural to see a team of kids 5 to 11 years with the task to do something for others. All that seemed natural and came right from their heart. Nothing seemed to matter to them: their playtime, and then heat outside--they just wanted to help and do something nice in the community! I helped them make some fresh juice and brought out some waste materials to help clean cars. Passers-by were amazed and one even shouted at them saying ""Good kids"". One of them even tried giving them 5 dollars, which they refused. A pretty heart-warming scene! The following weekend, I saw the idea of the week, the theme of which was ""Global Kindness"". I was moved by such wonderful and loving souls. They made me smile! One of the slogans on their flag was: ""Do not fear! Smile retrievers are here."""

"By saying ""Time will have the last word."", the writer means "" _ ""."	The time may soon come when we say goodbye to most of the world's languages. Today humans express themselves in over 6,000 different languages. But that is quickly changing. Many scientists say that over half of these languages will disappear within the next 50 years. After 100 years, the languages used in the world will not be more than 20. Why? It is because people from different cultures live and work together much more often than before. This brings changes. The languages of the world's main culture are replacing the languages of the smaller cultures. Most international trade takes place in world languages such as English. People respect their own cultures and traditions, but when it comes to getting a job, knowing a world language is often necessary. It may mean the difference between success and failure. Technology works on the change of languages in an even more amazing way. Modern media such as radio and television give young people in developing countries much knowledge about the world. But this knowledge doesn't come in words from the mouths of their parents or the elders in their neighborhood. It usually comes in the language of a different culture. People in different cultures think it good for them to share a popular language. They can quickly share ideas and work together. Knowing the same language means easier communication and is a basis for trust. Is the death of a small local language such a terrible thing? The answer is maybe. Many cultures may have words for many useful things we know nothing about. If their languages die, their valuable wisdom may be lost forever. The future of the world's language depends on our actions now. Will we protect endangered languages or allow them to quietly disappear? Time will have the last word.	['let us wait and see']
According to the passage, which of the following statements is NOT true?	"Harry Houdini was one of the greatest American entertainers in the theater this century. He was a man famous for his escapes from prison cells, from wooden boxes floating in rivers, from locked tanks full of water. He appeared in theaters all over Europe and America. Crowds came to see the great Houdini and his ""magic"" tricks. Of course, his secret was not magic or supernatural power. It was simply strength. He had the ability to move his toes as well as he moved his fingers. He could move his body into almost any position he wanted. Houdini started working in the entertainment world when he was 17, in 1891. He and his brother Theo performed card tricks in clubs in New York. They called themselves the Houdini Brothers. When Harry married in 1894, he and his wife Bess worked together as magician and assistant. But for a long time they were not very successful. Then Harry performed his first prison escape in Chicago in 1898. Harry persuaded a detective to let him try to escape from the prison, and he invited the local newspapermen to watch. It was the publicity that came from this that started Harry Houdini's success. Harry had fingers trained to escape from handcuffs and toes trained to escape from ankle chains. But his biggest secret was how he unlocked the prison doors. Every time he went into the prison cell, Bess gave him a kiss for good luck and a small skeleton key, which is a key that fits many locks. She passed it quickly from her mouth to his. Harry used these prison escapes to build his fame. He arranged to escape from the local prison of every town he visited. In the afternoon, the people of the town would read about it in their local newspapers, and in the evening every seat in the local theater would be full. What was the result? Worldwide fame and a name remembered today."	['Houdini first entered the entertainment world together with his wife.']
After some of the young men in White Bird's group killed eleven white persons, _ .	"In eighteen seventy-seven,the American government decided to move the Nez Perce Indians from their land. The government had set up a reservation for them in Idaho. Chief Joseph did not want to leave the land. It was holy ground. It contained the bones of his father and mother. But,like his father in earlier times,Chief Joseph knew it would be hopeless to stay and defend the land. There were too few Indians to win a war against the white men. And so in June of eighteen seventy-seven,the Nez Perce left their home in the Wallowa Valley. They left quickly. They were able to take only a small part of what they owned,and just a few cattle and Appaloosa horses. When the Indians reached the Snake River,the water was very deep and ran very fast with melted snow from the mountains. Chief Joseph and his people made boats from sticks and dried animal skins to cross the river. While the Indians were busy,a group of white men came and stole some of the cattle waiting at the edge of the river. The other chiefs demanded that Joseph call a meeting. Two of the chiefs,White Bird and Toohoolhoolzote,spoke for War,but Joseph held different opinion. Some of the young men in White Bird's group were very angry. That night,they rode into the countryside and killed eleven white persons. During all his years as chief,Joseph had tried to keep the peace. Now he saw there was no hope. Although he and his young men had taken no part in the killings,he knew that the white men would blame all of the Indians. Chief Joseph said,""I would have given my own life if I could have undone the killing of the white men."" Many Nez Perce fled. Chief Joseph remained,because his wife was about to have a baby. After she gave birth,he and his family joined the others in White Bird Canyon to the south. Joseph wanted to lead the people to safety in the flat lands of Montana. But the United States army quickly sent horse soldiers to follow them. They were extremely tired when they reached White Bird Canyon. An Indian--carrying a white flag--walked forward to meet them. A soldier shot him. With that shot,war between the Nez Perce and the United States began."	['the United States army wanted to revenge']
Among the possible reasons for the missing-children cases in Canada, which one is the most frequent?	"Never Talk to Strangers? ""Never talk to strangers."" Many children are taught this simple rule as a precaution against abduction . In June, 2005, an 11-year-old boy was lost in the Utah wilderness for four days. During that time, he stayed on the path. He saw people searching for him but deliberately hid from them, afraid someone might ""steal"" him. Eventually, the unfortunate game of hide-and-seek ended and he was found. According to the Canada Safety Council, this alarming incident shows how unwise it is to instill a fear of strangers in children. The ""stranger danger"" message can prevent children from developing the social skills and judgment needed to deal effectively with real-life situations. In a difficult situation, a stranger could be their lifeline to safety. To have a child go missing is a parent's worst nightmare. The threat of abduction by a stranger is minimal when compared with other possible reasons for a disappearance. In 2004, there were 67,266 missing-children cases in Canada. Only 31 involved abduction; in most of those cases the abductor was a relative, friend, or person known to the family. There were 671 cases of children wandering off, and 332 cases of abductions by a parent. Almost 80 percent of all cases were runaways. These statistics cast doubt on the idea that children should never talk to strangers. Wandering off is more common--but a lost children may have to call upon a stranger for help, and must develop the ability to judge what kind of people to approach. The ""never talk to strangers"" rule does not protect children in the situations they are most likely to face. On top of this, it can be confusing. Adults do not model the behaviour; they often talk to strangers. A child may not know how to tell who is a stranger, and who is not. For young children, nothing replaces close supervision . Pre-schoolers do not understand risk and tend to act without thinking. Children need to develop habits and sttitudes that will protect them from the real threats and dangers they may face. The Canada Safety Council encourages parents to give their children age-appropriate positive messages about safety, bearing in mind how youngsters may understand their world."	['Running away.']
As a form of advertising, product placement _ .	"A few years ago, a company called Space Marketing came up with a plan to send a mile-long advertisement into space. To advertising agencies , it would have been ""a dream come true"". However, advertising standards agencies finally decided not to allow Space Marketing to go ahead with their plans and they were forced to give them up. Space may indeed be the final place for advertisers, because on Earth we are already surrounded by advertising wherever we are and whatever we are doing. Apart from the obvious adverts that we see every day on TV, and in newspapers and magazines, there is a whole ' _ ' of advertising messages for our attention. There are ads that we see on the side of the bus we catch to work, for example. And what about the logos we see on the clothing of the people we walk past in the streets? Most of the time, we are probably not even aware of these less obvious advertising methods, but that doesn't mean that they don't work. Take 'product placement', for example. You are in a cinema, watching the latest Hollywood movie. Look carefully at the make of car your favorite actor is driving. And what about his watch? Can you see what brand it is? Chances are, you can, and the company that owns the brand is likely to have paid thousands for it to appear in the film. So, whether Space Marketing finally succeeds in sending ads into space or not is perhaps less important than it might seem. This would not change a thing. Our everyday lives are already strongly influenced by advertising whether we realize it or not."	['is less obvious than TV ads']
Who mentions the importance of friends?	Sharon,Aged 22 The most important thing to keep in mind when going into high school is to be yourself.Besides, I don't know what your middle school was like, but high school teachers will not care about things such as how much homework you already have in one night.It's best to just learn to deal with things and manage your time wisely so you can achieve everything you need to. Frank, Aged 21 I think almost every kid feels both nervous and excited before their first day.You will probably love it.I know I did.You should join some sports or activities that will make your high school experience more enjoyable.Good luck! Eddie,Aged 20 When I started high school I was really nervous too,especially since I had been homeschooled all through middle school and didn't really know anyone.I suppose the best advice would be to just relax.The first couple of days can be a little bit hard,but things will become easier before you know it. David,Aged 19 I'm not going to lie.The first day is kind of frightening .But you'll get used to it.Don't be afraid of anyone;upperclassmen will pick on you more if you let them know you're afraid.Just take it easy.Making some friends and staying with them will greatly help you get used to high school quickly.After the first week it's really not bad at all.Don't worry.

The report was written by _ scientists.	Scientists have written a report on the future of trade and industry. They talk about the role robots will play in industry. What is a robot?Basically ,it is a machine which is designed to do the work of a human being. It is usually controlled by a computer. Once it has been given a set of things to do,it will do the job on its own. Nowadays,Britain has 120 robots at work in industry. This compares badly with other industrial countries. In Japan,there are 4,000 robots in use. In the USA there are 2,000 and in Germany there are 500. According to the report,the government must help people understand how robot technology can be used. Also,people must be educated to know how important this new technology is. The designing of new robots will be very important in the future. The report says that special robot centres should be set up where people who design robots and people who will use them work together. The assembly work of the future will be complex . So firms must develop robots to do it.	['English']

The habit of listening to music can make a student _ .	We know music is very important in our daily life. Do you notice music playing at any of those places when you go somewhere? Today most stores, stations, restaurants and other places play music. You might even hear music in an office or on a farm. Scientists believe that music influences the way people behave . They think that the sound of western classical music makes people feel richer. When a restaurant plays classical music, people spend more money on food and drinks. When the restaurant plays modern music, people spend less money. Without music, people spend less. Scientists also believe that loud, fast music makes people eat faster. Some restaurants play fast music during their busy hours. This makes people eat faster and leave quickly. Restaurants can make more money in this way.

And listening to music can help you relax.[ The next time you hear music somewhere, be careful. It might influence the way you do things. ,.	['think and learn better']
The author's purpose of writing this passage is to _	People in the United States honor their parents with two special days: Mother's Day, on the second Sunday in May, and Father's Day, on the third Sunday in June. Mother's Day was proclaimed a day for national observance by President Woodrow Wilson in 1915. Ann Jarvis from Grafton, West Virginia, had started the idea to have a day to honor mothers. She was the one who chose the second Sunday in May and also began the custom of wearing a carnation. In 1909, Mrs. Dodd from Spokane, Washington, thought of the idea of a day to honor fathers. She wanted to honor her own father, William Smart. After her mother died, he had the responsibility of raising a family of five sons and a daughter. In 1910, the first Father's Day was observed in Spokane. Senator Margaret Chase Smith helped to establish Father's Day as a national commemorative day, in 1972. These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead.Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery. On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories.

When the earthquake took place, the writer was _ .	"I shall never forget the day when the earthquake took place. The time was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and I was driving along the road to take my daughter from school. Our plan was to go swimming together. I had finished my work at 4 o'clock and then gone to the Post Office. Then I'd stopped off at a shop in order to get some fresh fruit. We like to have some fruit to eat after our swim. I was driving along a high road on my way to my daughter's school. Over my road was another road which was built like a bridge for cars coming to the other way. I was hungry so I put the bag of apples in the seat beside me and started to eat one. Suddenly I saw the cars in front of me start to move from side to side. Then my car started to shake! I didn't know what was happening. Perhaps something had gone wrong with my car. I drove a little more slowly and then I stopped the car and at the same moment the road fell onto the cars in front of me. I found myself in the dark. I couldn't move. The bottom parts of both of my legs and my feet were hurting badly and I couldn't move them. All around me was quiet. But above me I could hear shouts and a lot of noise. Then I memorized what had happened. I had been in an earthquake. For about two hours nobody came. Luckily I could reach the bag of apples, so at least I had plenty to eat. Then I heard people climbing towards me. A team of people had come to see if anyone was under the broken road. I called out. ""I'm here!"" I heard a shout. Soon a stranger climbed to the side of the road near my car. ""How are you doing?"" he asked. ""Not too bad,"" I said, ""but my feet and leg feel as if they're broken."" ""We'll have you out of there just as soon as we can."" They didn't get me out until the next morning. I had been in my car for fourteen hours."	['under a road built like a bridge']

""We want to be sure that the pets here go to good homes,"" Mr. Snow said, ""So I need to ask you some questions."" After they talked for a while, the Browns decided to get a small dog. It wouldn't need a big house or a big yard. A small dog would bark and warn them if someone tried to break into their house. After Mr. Snow gave the Browns a book on pet care, they chose one and wanted to take her home right away. But the animal doctor hadn't examined her yet. So Mr. Snow told them to return on Sunday. On Sunday afternoon the Browns went to the animal shelter. The animal doctor said, ""Shadow has had all of her shots . She will be healthy."" The Browns thanked the doctor and took Shadow home."

What can we learn from News 2?	Here is some news of the future. March 20, 2035 There was a lot of news around the life extension drugs that hit the market a decade ago. They didn't promise that you would like forever, but they gave you a chance to extend your life an extra five to ten years. Even though the life expectancy rate at birth has increased greatly, the life expectancy for seniors hasn't improved that much. Basically, you have a greater chance to become a senior, but you will not have a much longer lifespan, and this is where the anti-aging drugs intend to kick in. So, do the anti-aging drugs work? Well,it is too early to tell. But the sales so far are very good. April 19, 2035 Of the total US population of 378 million, people over 65 years of age now make up 20% for the first time. The senior ratio of only 4.1% by year 1900, and 12.4% 30 years ago. The number of people above 65 compared to those of what is considered working ages, between 15 and 64, is currently 33.7%. This is up from 18.5% since year 2005, which means that for every retired person there are now two workers, compared to four workers 30 years ago. The number of people above the age of 80 has grown to 23.8 million, making them 6.3% of the total population compared to 3.6% in 2005. April 12, 2040 Although introduced in the market only five years ago, 10% of all hydrogen fuel now sold in the US is of the environmentally friendly Re-Hydro label, produced through eletrolysis based on a source of 100% renewable energy. Several producers have turned to producing Re-Hydro, mainly because of lower tax, which also keeps the price of Re-Hydro on the same level as regular hydrogen. Most analysts believe that Re-Hydro will be the dominating fuel in the future.	['The US population has been aging rapidly since 2005.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) --- Two people found dead on a rain-flooded road in Beijing Sunday night are doubted to have been killed by lightning, as the heaviest rainstorm in 13 years hit the city from Sunday through Monday morning and is expected to last into Monday evening. The victims, a man and a woman were found dead on a road outside a plant in Nancai Industrial Park in Shunyi District at 9 p.m. Sunday. The northern district of Miyun recorded rainfall of 243 mm in 22 hours before 6 a.m. Monday, said Wei Jianmin, chief forecaster of the Beijing Observatory . He said the rain is important to fill up Beijing's important water source of the Miyun Reservoir , which has received 17 million cubic meters of water during the rain so far. Although the rain had little effect on traffic Monday, it caused a disorder in the city's busy air traffic. According to Beijing Capital International Airport's website, 329 flights were called off due to the rainstorm. Meanwhile, traffic on a rail link between Beijing and Chengde City in neighboring Hebei province was put off after several sections of the track were flooded in rainwater Sunday night. Workers are still rushing to clear the railway. The city acted Sunday evening to take measures against rainstorm-caused disasters. More than 6,000 people living in the hilly regions of Miyun and Pinggu districts in Beijing's outskirts were brought to safe grounds Sunday evening before floods threatened more than 10 villages and caused four landslides there. The China National Meteorological Center on Monday morning continued a rainstorm warning, forecasting rains to hit Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Liaoning and Hebei provinces in the north, as well as eastern Shandong and Jiangsu provinces in the next 24 hours.

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	Some people think that as more and more people have televisions in their homes, fewer and fewer people will buy books and newspapers. Why read an article in the newspaper, when the TV news can bring you the information in a few minutes and with pictures? Why read the life story of a famous man, when a short television program can tell you all that you want to know? _ . Today, newspapers sell in very large numbers. And books of every kind are sold more than ever before. Books are still a cheap way to get information and enjoyment. Although some books with hard covers are expensive, many books are printed today as paperbooks , which are quite cheap. A paperback collection of short stories, for example, is always cheaper than an evening at the cinema or the theater, and you can keep a book for ever and read it many times. Books are a wonderful provider of knowledge and pleasure and some types of books should be in every home. Every home should have a good dictionary. A good encyclopedia , though expensive, is useful, too, because you can find information on any subject. Besides, you can have such books as history books, science textbook, cookbooks, and collections of stories and poems. Then from time to time you can take a book of poems off your shelves and read the thoughts and feelings of your favorite poets.	['reading is a cheap way of learning and having fun.']
"The""comparison shopping""refers to the behavior of."	Advertising actually has a dual function:to sell,as well as to inform.If you stop to think of it,advertisements(ads)provide information of almost everything in our household and immediate environment,from shampoo to fuel for cars.An obvious purpose is to inform consumers of new products and services as well as to remind them of established ones.Performance,price,value for money,quality and reliability are some of the main features mentioned in ads. Yet there is another important side of advertising that should not be forgotten:choice.A number of ads for different brands of the same product,e.g.toothpaste,shampoo or washing powder allow the consumer to choose.Choice is an important part of buying. In this busy day and age,there is little time for _ .To determine which product is the best to buy,and at the most competitive price,consumers these days rely on advertising in its various forms.This saves time and energy and makes shopping easier. Few can deny that ads benefit the consumer since they encourage healthy competition.When companies compete for the consumer's dollar,this is good for the purchaser of the product or service.Advertising tends to increase competition since it informs consumers of what is available.One company's offer will be either matched or bettered by another company in its advertising. It was unheard of ten years ago to buy products directly using a personal computer,but it has become a matter of course for some people to browse the Internet,surfuntil they find an e commerce site and then select the product.Marketing products has been almost turned upside down by new ways of selling and buying.More than at any time in history,the choice of goods is unlimited.The whole world is a customer's marketplace.For busy people like you and me,advertisements actually do us a favor.

Which writing strategy is NOT used in developing the passage?	"While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. ""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity."" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. ""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents."" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures."

Parents come to the Institute because they want _ .	"An American psychotherapist Glenn Doman wrote a best-selling book calledHow to Teach Your Baby to Readin 1963. Now translated into 17 languages, this book arose from his work with brain-damaged children in Pennsylvania. Doman and his team of specialists had wondered why brain-injured children didn't improve with treatment. Then they realized that orthodox methods of treatment only relieved the symptoms, not the problem, which of course was the brain itself. So they develop a new approach. ""All we do for all the children here is to give them visual, auditory and tactile stimulation with increased frequency, intensity and duration, in recognition of the orderly way in which the brain grows,"" says Doman. ""The result was that by 1960 we had hundreds of severely brain-injured two-year-olds who could read and understand."" The team had discovered that even children who had half their brains removed could, by stimulation, achieve higher IQs than the average normal child. Then the team began to think if such amazing results could be achieved with brain-damaged children, what would happen if the same treatment were given to normal children? So eight years ago the Better Baby Institute was opened for the benefit of normal children. The same stimulating environment was provided, and by the time the children left, around seven years old, they could generally speak and read three foreign languages, play a musical instrument, read three full-length books a week and do all the other things that a so-called ""normal"" child could do. In Doman's view, the child's passion to learn during the years up to six must be fed. He believes that, like muscles, the brain develops with use, especially so in those first few years. Nowadays, parents come from all over the world to Pennsylvania to see and learn from the workof Doman and his team; they want to discover how they can fulfill their roles as nature's teachers, by using their love, understanding and instincts for the benefit of the children. For in the words of Doman, ""every child born has a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci used""."	['to develop their own abilities to help their children']
What do you think of the bar manager?	"There was a man playing the piano in a bar. He was a good piano player and always performed in this bar. People came in just to hear him play. But one night, a customer told him that he didn't want to hear him just play the piano any more. He wanted him to sing a song. The man said, ""I don't sing."" But the customer was persistent . He told the bar manager, ""I'm tired of listening to the piano. I want that man to sing!"" The manager shouted across the room, ""If you want to get paid, sing a song. Our customers are asking you to sing!"" So he did. He sang a song. A piano player who had never sung in public did so for the first time. And everyone was surprised by his song ""Mona Lisa"". He got lots of applause that night. He had such a talent for singing, but _ for the past years! If without such a chance, he may have lived the rest of his life as a no-name piano player in a no-name bar. However, now he has become one of the best-known singers in America. You, too, have skills and abilities. Maybe your ""talent"" is not as great as the singer above, but it may be better than you think! And with effort, most skills can be improved. So, in your life, you should be brave enough to try doing different things and find out what talents you really have!"	['Rude.']
The passage showed that _ .	Six chimps were introduced to a slot machine called the Chimp- O- Mat, which would give out one grape when a white coin was insert into the slot. When Dr Wolf showed a young chimp named Moos how he could win himself a grape by inserting a coin, Moos immediately picked up another coin, pushed it into the slot, then stuck out his paw and waited for a grape to drop out.. Besides white coins, the chimps were given yellow coins to insert into the slot, but nothing came out because they were worthless. The chimps soon learned this fact. When a handful of white and yellow coins were thrown into the cage housing, Bula, Bimba and Alpha, the three chimps rushed for the white coins and never touched the yellow ones. Now the chimps were madly in love with money. Would the six chimps value money enough to work for it? To find the answer, Dr Wolfe designed a work machine. The chimps were shown that when a large handle was lifted, they could pick one grape. When they had learned the skill of lifting the handle to get the grape, Dr Wolf made a change to the machines so that instead of the grape they would find a white coin. This coin would still buy them one grape at the Chimp- O- Mat. Thus the complexity of getting a grape was not only doubled, but also the money to buy the grape could be achieved only by honest work. The handle they had to lift to get the coin weighed eighty pounds. Great effort is needed for a young chimp to raise that weight, yet the formerly lazy chimps not only quickly mastered the new operation, but also showed great eagerness to work for money.	['The chimps were willing to work if something was paid back']
According to the passage _ of the buyers are NOT content with their houses.	"Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were "" "" into buying ""third grade"" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied. Experts have suggested consumers gather thorough knowledge about a developer and their work before deciding to buy a house from it. They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible."	['80%']
Why do English people like DIY ?	"DIY, which means Do It Yourself, is quite popular in UK. Lots of stores and supermarkets sell DIY things. TV programs show people how to DIY. English people like DIY. There is a saying in UK---""An Englishman's home is his castle"". Huge numbers of people spend their holidays making their homes beautiful ""castles"". If there is anything that needs fixing around their houses, such as painting the walls or putting in a new shower, they will do the jobs themselves. They share DIY experiences with their friends. More and more people have discovered the joy of DIY. Sometimes people also DIY for saving money. With the economic downturn at present, many people can not afford to buy a bigger house. They are looking at how they can make their houses better without spending a lot of money. It is not surprising that DIY is so popular. DIY can be difficult. There is a huge market for DIY furniture which people need to put together themselves with a few basic tools . However, people often find it not easy to build a piece of furniture because they can't understand the instructions. Sometimes the instructions are simple and clear, but the furniture itself is difficult to build. One thing is for sure, though most DIY projects are started with the best intentions (,), many of them may not get finished. DIY can also be dangerous. For example, anything electrical should be done by a professional worker. Unluckily, many people don't care about this warning and put themselves in danger. It is reported that in just one year over 230 000 people were hurt while doing DIY in UK, including 41 000 who fell off ladders . Therefore, DIY can bring us fun and help us save money, but it is not always as easy as it is thought to be if _ . Maybe factories should make products that are easier and safer for us to DIY."

What do we know about the NSF?

The mixing of science and art in Antarctica isn't new.Some of the earliest explorersbrought along painters and photographers.Edward Wilson was a British painter,doctor,and bird expert who journeyed with RobertFalcon Soott on two separate Antamtic expeditionsmore than 100 years ago.Herbert Ponting was a photographer who also accompanied Scott on one of those expeditions.In hundreds of photos,Pontingcaptured the beauty of the continentand recorded the daily lives and heroic struggles of the explorers.

There is only one difference between and old man and young one: the young man has a beautiful future before him while the old man a splendid future behind him and maybe that id where the rub is. When I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and unknown -that I was a new boy in a hug w school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem.

While eating fried chicken, pizza and burgers will all entail a gym session of over an hour doing cardio or lifting weights, women have it far harder than men and must work extra hard to banish calorie-packed meals.

As for women, fifty one minutes of cardio would help counter the 24 grams of fat in a Big Mac---over a quarter of the recommended daily allowance - --or an hour and eight minutes of weightlifting. However, the 450g Tesco chocolate cake was by far the worst offender. Clocking in at a whopping 1,710 calories and 90 grams of fat, only a hardcore gym session is going to shift the calories you've absorbed from this dessert. The average woman would have to lift weights for almost four hours to work off the calories in this cake. Comparatively a chocolate bar seems healthy, with 237 calories which would take 25 minutes for the average woman to run off. Alternatively you could spend thirty three minutes doing weightlifting exercises. Men will have to complete 40 minutes of cardio and 53 minutes of weightlifting while women will have to complete 48 minutes of cardio and 64 minutes of weightlifting against the calories in French fries.

In the United States, age sixteen marks the time when you can _ .	"In the United States, sixteen, eighteen, and twenty-one are important ages in a person's life. There are no special celebrations for these birthdays, but each is a time when a person can do new things to mark their transition into adulthood. After turning sixteen a person can work, get a driver's license and leave home. Many high school students learn to drive and get part-time jobs soon after celebrating their sixteenth birthday. At the age of eighteen a person in the United States can vote and smoke, but they are prohibited from going into nightclubs, buying wine or gambling until they are twenty-one. In many Latin cultures, a young woman's fifteenth birthday is important. At this age, she is regarded as an adult. To mark this special day, families with teenage daughters have a celebration called a Quinceanera. The day begins with the young woman and her family going to church. Later, there is a party and many guests are invited. In Japan, young people became adults at twenty. At this age, they can legally vote, drink wine and smoke. The second Monday in January is a national holiday called ""Coming of Age Day"". On this day, twenty-year-old celebrates by first going to church to pray with their families. Later, they listen to speeches given by city and school leaders. Afterward, they may celebrate with family or friends late into the night. In some countries, birthday celebrations continue through adulthood. Some people celebrate their fortieth and fiftieth birthdays, or their retirement year, with a huge party."	['drive and get a job']
"""You can never go home again""in the last sentence of the passage means that _ ."	"Last week I visited one of my old neighborhoods in Washington D.C.I had not been there for twenty years and as I walked along the street, my mind was flooded by memories of the past. I saw the old apartment building where I had lived and the playground where I had played. As I viewed these once familiar surroundings, images of myself as a child there came to mind. However, what I saw and what I remembered were not the same. I sadly realized that the best memories are those left untouched. My old apartment building, as I remember, was bright and alive. It was more than just a place to live. It was a movie house, a space station, or whatever my young mind could imagine. I would steal away with my friends and play in the basement. This was always exciting because it was so cool and dark, and there were so many things there to hide among. There was a small river in the back of the building. We would go there to lie in the shade of trees and enjoy ourselves. However, what I saw was completely different. The apartment building was now in disrepair. What was once more than a place to live looked hardly worth living in. The windows were all broken. The once clean walls were covered with dirty marks. The river was hardly recognizable. The water was polluted and the trees and flowers were all dead. The once sweet-smelling river now smelled terrible. It was really heartbreaking to see all this. I do not regret having seen my old neighborhood. However, I do not think my innocent childhood memories can ever be the same. I suppose it is true when they say, ""You can never go home again."""

Robert Spring spent 15 years _ .	"Robert Spring, a 19th century forger , was as good at his profession that he was able to make his living for 15 years by selling false signatures of famous Americans. Spring was born in England in 1813 and arrived in Philadelphia in 1858 to open a bookstore. At first he make some money by selling his small but genuine of early U.S. autographs . Discovering his ability at copying handwriting, he began imitating signatures of George Washington and Ban Franklin and writing them on the title pages of old books. To make less the chance of detection , he sent his forgeries to England and Canada for sale and circulation . Forgers have a hard time selling their products. A forger can't approach a respectable buyer but must deal with people who don't have much knowledge in the field. Forgers have many ways to make their work look real. For example, they buy old books to use the aged paper of the title page, and they can treat paper and ink with chemicals. In Spring's time, right after the Civil War, Britain was still fond of the Southern states, so Spring invented a respectable maiden lady known as Miss Fanny Jackson, the only daughter of General ""Stonewall"" Jackson. For several years Miss Fanny's economic problems forced her to sell a great number of letters and manuscripts belonging to her famous father. Spring had to work very hard to satisfy the demand. All this activity did not prevent Spring from dying in poverty, leaving sharp-eye experts the difficult task of separating this forgeries from the originals."	['as a forger']
What does Paul Davies think of human existence on Mars?	While all my classmates seen to be crazy about a one-way ticket to Mars , I'd rather say Mars is totally unsuitable for human existence. People won't have enough food supplies there, and the terrible environment would make it impossible for them to live a long life. Besides, the journey won't be safe. Can anybody explain to me just why people would go to Mars, never to return? Steve Minear, UK Here are the things you can think of: the desire to explore a foreign and unique environment, the excitement of being the first humans to open up a new world, the expectation of fame and glory...For scientists there is another reason. Their observations and research will probably lead to great scientific achievements. Donal Trollop, Canada There are already too many people on the Earth. I think that sometime before the end of the century, there will be a human colony on Mars. It will happen when people finally realize that tow-way trips to the red planet Mars are unnecessary. Most of the danger of space Flight is in the launches and landings. Cutting the trip home would therefore reduce the danger of accidents, save a lot of money, and open the way to building an everlasting human settlement on another world. Enough supplies can be sent on ahead. And every two years more supplies and more people will needs, and Mars is far more pleasant than the other planets in the outer space. Paul Davies.

People often wear _ for an informal party according to the passage.	"One day this same friend invited me to a party . It was not a real party , it was some kind of informal get-together . Since it was summertime he had a cookout where most of his American friends and s were known to me , but there were others I had never met before . It was the most embarrassing party for me when I noticed that everyone was wearing jeans and simple T-shirts for the day , while I arrived in proper dress with my shoes and my hair all fixed for a fancy party . It was hard to explain my embarrassment to the other guests . When one of them turned around and said ""What nice clothes ! What's the occasion ?"" I felt my face burning hot with embarrassment . I did not answer at all . Many times I thought about going home and changing , but I knew that they would notice . It would be even worse for me , because I knew they would quickly think that I felt out of place . So I wanted to pretend that I was okay ."	['a T-shirt']
What punishment waits for Buster Brown?	"Buster Brown was a thief and a good one too, he thought. He'd never been caught by the police because he never took chances. He was always prepared for any unforeseen event or emergency. Confidently, he stood outside the house of his intended victim and read the sign on the front gate of the house. ""Don't worry about the dog--be aware of the owner!"" it said. Buster smiled and found his way in. The house looked quite normal outside, but inside it was very _ with fascinating objects on show. As he began putting them into his bag, a dog came into the room. It stopped when it saw Buster, then wagged its tail madly and went over to him, licking his outstretched hand. ""Good boy, ""Buster whispered. ""What a great guard dog you are--trying to lick me to death."" Satisfied he'd made friends with the dog, Bluster began to wander round the house, choosing items to put in his bag. His skilled eye picked out only the best antiques :a pair of silver candle holders, a silver tea-and-coffee service, etc. . His new friend, the dog, sat and watched, as if wondering what was happening. ""Well, boy,"" Buster whispered, finally. ""That might do. Any more and I won't be able to carry it! "" He swung the heavy bag onto his shoulders, just as the lights came on, nearly blinding him. He shielded his eyes with his hand. ""You're a very silly person,"" the figure in the doorway said, his voice dry and dust. As the man came closer, Buster could see he was well dressed. His face seemed familiar, but Buster couldn't quite place where he had seen him before. ""You should have taken more notice of the sign outside,"" the man rasped. ""I knew about this attempted robbery last week and I also know you will end up behind bars for 20 years. Fancy trying to rob the house of the world's greatest fortune -teller!"""

What does the author suggest at the end of the story?	"I discovered the power of fear when I became stuck to my driveway, as if my feet were crazy--glued to the cement .As much as I tried, I could not move them. The realization that my daughters were playing in Nancy's house, just one-half block away, paralyzed my legs, making me unable to move when I neared the end of our driveway. Dense, black smoke was rising from behind the Sycamore Maple trees on the other side of the street and was enveloping three houses, making them barely visible. Nancy's house was one of them. I tried to call out for my daughters hoping to see them run safely to my arms, but my voice was also stuck - stuck in my throat with no intention of coming out. There I stood, helpless, paralyzed and silenced by fear, unable to protect the two little girls I loved more than even I had realized. Although trapped in a body that couldn't move or speak, I could still hear. I could hear other mothers anxiously calling their children. I could hear a frightening silence that covered the neighborhood instead of the usual happy voices of children. And, finally, I could hear the alarm of the fire engine. As the alarm announced, ""We're on our way,"" it instantly dissolved the crazy glue that had held my feet to the cement and it unlocked the soundproof box that had silenced my voice. I was free to make sure my daughters were safe. As I continued down the driveway, two little girls, my two little girls, ran toward me from across the street. They had come home to tell me about the fire in the garage next to Nancy's house. Not only did my feet and voice work now, but my eyes were also in good working order and had no trouble producing tears."	['She burst into tears of relief and happiness.']
The robbery took place _ .	"At three a.m., Jack Mills was sitting at the controls of the mail train. The train was made up of 13 cars. At the end of the train, 71 mailmen sat sorting the mails. Inside the second car, there were only five mailmen and 128 bags full of five-pound notes. This train had run more than 100 years without being robbed. At three minutes past three, Mills and his helper, David Whitby, saw a yellow warning light. They slowed the train, and then stopped. Whitby went to the telephone beside the track. It was out of order. Then he saw a man moving between the second and the third cars. Before Whitby could give a warning, he was knocked down by two men. Mills' cars with all the mailmen had been disconnected by the robbers. At the bridge, the bags of money were unloaded from the train and thrown into waiting trucks. One of the robbers who obviously knew the schedules of all the trains kept looking at his watch. At 3:45 he said, ""That will have to be enough."" The robbers drove away with more than 2,500,000 pounds."	['in the early morning']

When I was 13, my family moved away , Linda and I kept in touch through letters ,and we saw each other on special times - like my wedding and Linda's. Soon we were busy with childern and moving to new homes, and we wrote less often , One day a card that I sent came back , stamped ""Address Unknown"", I had no idea about how to find Linda. Over the years, I missed Linda very much, I wanted to share happiness of my children and then grandchildren , And I needed to share my sadness when my brother and then moth-er died, There was an empty place in my heart that only a friend like Linda could fill. One day, I was reading a newspaper when I noticed a photo of a young woman who looked very much like Linda and whose last name was Wagman --Linda's married name.""There must be thousands of Wagmans.""I thought, but I still wrote to her. She called as soon as she got my letter, ""Mrs , Tobin!""she said excitedly, ""Linda Ev-ans Wagman is my mother."" Minutes later I heard a voice that I recognized at once, even after 40 years ,We laughed and cried and caught up on each other's lives, Now the empty place in my heart is filled, And there's one thing that Linda and I know for sure; We won't lose each other again!"

Children need _ .	Early to bed, early to rise , makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. This is an old English saying. Have you heard it before? It means that we must go to bed early in the evening and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy. We shall also be rich (wealthy) and clever (wise). Is this true? Perhaps it is. The body must have enough sleep. Children need ten hours' sleep every night. If you do not go to bed early, you cannot have enough sleep. Then you cannot think properly and you cannot do your work properly. You will not be wise and you may not become wealthy! Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We must sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep properly, When the daylight comes, we must get up. This is the time for exercise. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running, jumping, swimming, and playing games are all exercise. If the body is not used, it becomes weak. Exercise keeps it strong. Exercise helps the blood to move around inside the body. This is very important. The brains in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains. If we keep our bodies healthy, and take exercise, we can think better. Our bodies also need air to breathe. Without air we die. We must have a lot of clean, fresh air to breathe if we want to be healthy.	"[""ten hours' sleep""]"

One day Mark Twain was invited to give a talk in a small town. At lunch he met a young man, one of his friends. The young man said that he had an uncle with him. He told Mark Twain that his uncle never laughed or smiled, and that nobody and nothing was able to make his uncle smile or laugh. ""You bring your uncle to my talk this evening,"" said Mark Twain.

All your college education will not help if you don't put your mind to selling. Think on your feet. Use psychology,"" Andrew spoke with diffidence overwhelmed by his father's criticism. ""You've been in this shop for six months and you haven't succeeded in selling a single computer. I tell you what. I'll give you one more chance. I'll give you another three more weeks. If you still can't make one sale, I'll call in your elder brother to replace you. He will also take over the shop when I retire. There. I'll just give you one last chance to prove yourself,"" said Mr. Whitely, his patience wearing thin. Andrew's heart missed a beat. This time he would have to do it. Do or Die! A sense of urgency gripped him. Somehow he must prove himself to his father. It was now the end of the day and the shop was being closed. The assistant employed by his father, called Mike, chuckled and put his arms round poor Andrew to comfort him,"" Sort it out yourself. It's gotta come from yourself."" he said. The shop was located in a bustling shopping center. Andrew left the shop and walked round the complex aimlessly and by chance entered a large bookstore. He glanced at the books and was about to leave when his eyes caught some interesting titles:' How to increase your confidence,'' The art of communication,''How to sell well'amongst others. The next minute he was out of the store with the shopping bag bugling with books. In his apartment (for he loves separately from his parents and little sister),he settled himself in his easy chair and devoured the contents of the books, one by one. His keen intelligence enabled him to focus the details that matter and pick out the ideas and techniques expounded.In a week his image underwent a transformation. Gone was the stubble that used to give him an untidy image likened to a heroin addict.He was also smartly dressed now. Instead of his usual slurred speech and incoherence ,he spoke with clarity, purpose and forcefulness.He was more convincing and persuasive. Above all, confidence flowed from his being and he seemed to have learned a few tricks of the selling trade. He worked hard at his sales pitch and one day he succeeded in selling a computer. His first sale. He had finally achieved the quota of one sale within the given time frame of three weeks. The job, the shop, was his. He had to thank Mike for it. And now he had to go beyond his first successs and score, consistently and persistently. Nevertheless he had proved himself at last and the future looked bright and promising."

What can be inferred from the passage?	"Half a year before graduation from college, my son David began to seek a job. Due to the financial crisis, the competition was ever-fierce. My son targeted a company that was located in a coastal city. It was intended to employ only one person among more than twenty candidates, I said to David, ""You should not harbor too much hope for fear that you would feel terribly disappointed when you fail."" He said to me, ""I am not afraid of disappointment. As long as I try, there will always be hope!"" Three young men could enter the final round, which would later decide one person to be employed. Everything seemed to go quite well and David entered the final round in a week. Unexpectedly, the interview was unbelievably simple, during which the interviewer only chatted with them for a while. The interview strategies my son prepared were not useful at all. The interviewer said the company would inform them of the result in 3 days. On the morning of the third day, David received the text from the company that he was not employed. David felt disappointed. In nightfall that day, David suddenly told me excitedly on phone that he had been employed. Greatly surprised, I asked him, ""What's the whole matter?"" David told me that he received another text saying that he was employed. David felt very confused about it. Later he found out the first text sent to him was also part of the test in the interview. Three men received the same text this morning and only David's reply was satisfying to the company. I asked my son, ""How did all of you reply?"" My son said, ""One did not reply. The other said ""goodbye"" and I said ""thank you""."" Only then did I know that my son's ""hope"" came in that way. That is, when you feel disappointed, do not forget to say ""Thank you"" to the one who disappoints you. Actually, it is a piece of cake to say ""Thank you"". Saying ""Thank you"" shows respect for others' work and demonstrates your grand generosity. Therefore, while under the same condition, you will get the upper hand in terms of opportunities compared with others!"	"[""The author believed it's beneficial to say thank you.""]"

Eating was difficult for the grandfather because _ .	"An old man lived with his family. The family would eat together nightly at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon, dropping to the floor. When he grasped his glass of milk, it often spilled clumsily at the tablecloth. With this happening almost every night, the son and daughter-in-law became annoyed with the mess. ""We must do something about grandfather,"" said the son. ""I've had enough of his milk spilling, noisy eating and food on the floor,"" the daughter-in-law agreed. So the couple set a small table at the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed their dinner at the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in wooden bowls. Sometimes when the family looked in grandfather's direction, he had tears in his eyes as he ate alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp warnings when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence. One evening, before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood pieces on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, ""What are you making?"" Just as sweetly, the boy replied, ""Oh, I'm making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up."" The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. These words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears streamed down their cheeks. Though no words were spoken, both knew what must be done."	['he was old and weak']

Compared with humans, robots are better at _	"In the future, when robots can be used both in homes and in other areas, they could improve the living standards of people. Many people burn their energy on their day-to-day tasks like cooking, cleaning after work, etc. When robots can complete such jobs, people can spend more time with their family and friends. Experts say that many major problems in the modern world are caused by miscommunication. When people have more time, they can talk freely to solve such issues and eventually create a happy society. Robots can be used on certain jobs to avoid accidents caused by careless behavior of some people. When robots are used on such work, it does not risk any human life due to accidents at the workplace. Human resources can be efficiently used by performing tasks which demand human skills like critical thinking and problem solving. Robots can be used on low-end jobs like moving heavy things and heavy weight lifting. While some people talk about how robots can be useful to humans, others voice their concerns about reduction in human value and the creation of a lazy society due to heavy dependency on robots. When robots become cheaper to produce, employers may prefer to use more robots than humans. As the technology constantly improves the abilities of robots, it could weaken the value of humans. Many people may rely on robots heavily. Some may even develop the habit of using robots on tasks that they can easily do. This could create a lazy society. As an aging society, Japan sees it a must to build robots that take care of elderly people at their home, because without them, the nation's health care system can't cope. There will simply be too many elderly people to care for as the nation faces a decreasing birth rate, an aging population, and the loosening of family ties. However, many of Japan's elderly people would prefer human helpers rather than robots. Above all, Japan wants, if not ""needs"", its immigration policy is anti-immigration. In conclusion, robots can be used on anything that can eventually improve humans' living standards but we can't depend on them too much. Robots can be used to help humans live in harmony and form a happy society."	['working safely.']
Which kind of animal has a long-term memory?	"There's no doubt that man is the smartest. But do you know what other animals are smart, too? Dolphins Dolphins are very smart. Most of the ""tricks"" they're taught to do are actually behavior they would engage in on their own. They love to play, race and generally enjoy their life to the fullest. They speak a language we have yet to completely understand and like all civilized creatures, dolphins' mothers always provide their young children with guidance and possibly, love. Great apes The great ape family primarily consists of gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans. Their brain chemistry is so similar to humans' that NASA once used chimpanzees in place of astronauts during many dangerous missions. Gorillas have been taught sign language and orangutans exist in complex familial relationships. Elephants Everyone has heard the phrase ""an elephant never forgets"". Elephants establish long-term friendships, recognizing and remembering their friends years later. If an elephant comes upon a fallen friend, it has even been known to feel sad. Parrots As proved by this list, parrots are very smart. They are also the only animals listed that can actually hold a conversation. Some parrots know hundreds of words by imitating humans. The birds are also capable of remembering words and using them intelligently in response to situations."	['Elephants.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	Should teenagers help their parents do chores? Is it important for us to learn how to do chores? I have a classmate called Li Ting. She is the only child in her family. Her parents love her so much that they don't let her do any chores. On weekdays she gets up, has meals, goes to school, has lessons, she only plays with her friends. So she doesn't know how to do chores. One day, her father was badly ill and was in hospital. Her mother had to take care of her father in the hospital and couldn't cook meals for her for a week. Li Ting didn't know how to cook meals. She had a lot of trouble cooking meals and often felt hungry. She only had instant noodles for her meals. From the story, we know it's very important for us to learn to do chores.

Early last season, I wrote a column about an art of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the stadium.After it ran,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs.He said,""I read what you wrote about Jordan.but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice. A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Had Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood? ""Not two boys,"" Jordan said. ""But four."" And he named them. He said four names. And what did they talk about? ""Everything,"" Jordan said. "" Anything. I've asked to see their grades so that I can check to see if they're paying attention to their study. If it turns out that one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it."" It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life,one more thing that no one knows about, and one more thing Jordan does fight for. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do J! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come. For someone they can depend on."	['wanted to make sure they all studied well']
How many ways to find the missing children are mentioned in the passage?	The first ting we do is to put an APB and this goes to all the police stations in the country. Next we telephone the hospitals. Often the person we are looking for has been in an accident. Then we might try parents, friends or relatives they might be with. We try to follow their movements and to find the last person they saw in local or national papers--especially papers they might read. There are other things we can do: put posters in places where they might be, go on television. Here in America there is a magazine in which there are photographs of missing children. This is often the last hope. Of course, with nearly two million missing children every year, we can't do all these things for everyone. We haven't got the time, or the money , or the people who work for it.	['Six.']
What problem did Millie have at the beginning of the story?	"It was another day to jump rope in gym class. Lynn and Mike turned the long rope in big, slow circles. The whole class hurried to get in line to wait for their turn to jump. Millie stood at the back of the line and _ . Nick went first. He watched the rope and ran in at just the right time. Everyone counted. He made it all the way to 30 jumps. One after another, the kids watched the rope, ran in, and jumped. Then it was Millie's turn. She watched the rope go around and around, but she didn't move. She felt like everyone was looking at her. Millie's friends cheered. ""Go, Millie, go!"" Millie's face turned red. At last, she gave it a try, but she failed. The truth was that Millie had been jumping rope at home every day. With a short rope, she could jump 100 times without missing. She just didn't know how to run in and start jumping with a long rope. Since she was the only kid on her street, there was no one to help turn the long rope. Just then, Ms Miles, the gym teacher, brought out a bunch of short jump ropes. ""Let's see how long each one of you can jump without missing,"" she said as she gave each student a short rope, ""Ready, set. Go!"" Millie smiled for the first time ever in gym class. As she jumped, she sang rhymes quietly to herself. After a while, Millie realized that everyone was cheering, ""Go, Millie, go!"" She was the only one still jumping rope! The surprise almost made her miss a step, but she kept going. When at last she was too tired to go on, she stopped. The whole class cheered. Everyone was looking at her and smiling. Millie smiled back!"	"[""She didn't know how to start jumping with a long rope.""]"
What is the best title of this passage?	The ecosystem is 1ike a chain.If any of the links are broken,the whole system is in danger.This is why wetland protection has been put high on the agenda in recent years.Zhao,vice--director of the State Forestry Administration,says nearly 60 percent of the country's natural wetlands are still not under effective protection.Most Chinese people are ignorant about the importance of protecting the wetlands. Ocean,forestry and wetlands are the three global ecological systems.Wetlands can conserve and purify water resources, prevent flooding and help protect the ecosystem. As well as ecological values, they can also offer economical returns. In recent years,many wetlands have become farmland.Drawing too much underground water,hunting and fishing also ruin their ecological system. Every year,the wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China provide habitat for birds.Local residents search the area for the birds' eggs. They consider the eggs to be a natural gift. rather than wildlife that should be protected. If they were educated,perhaps this is one activity that could be brought to an end. China is now ready to make a plan to save some of these areas.Some have been restored to raise awareness among the public.But these moves are not enough.There should be laws in place to provide legal support to the fight. Environment protection is a campaign which needs support from everyone in society.Education may be the first step.	['Wetland protection keeps ecological harmony.']
The Harry Potter books led the author to _ .	"In reflecting on the events of my life that have impacted me, I returned to the night of August 1, 2006. I found myself in a hall in New York City sitting by my mother, not at all tired, although we had flown the day before, and driven five hours to the city for ""An Evening with Harry, Carrie and Garp,"" a charity event with readings by three authors. The excitement rushing through me kept me awake and thinking; I was standing and applauding a woman as she prepared to read. The Harry Potter series was my gateway to my academic adolescence. I was so fascinated by the magic world that my mother began taking me to academic conferences focused on the books. Since 2005, I have attended presentations about the Latin origin of terms and spells, the ancient tales, and the idea of magic. These books opened my eyes to the whole world, and to knowledge itself. They kept my brain working over the summers. More importantly, they helped me adopt the ideas useful in school and beyond, that there is always another way to do something, or to understand an issue. With uncertainty and doubt come creative ideas and new ways to look at problems that may result in new, different, faster and easier solutions. And all this came from a little ""magic"" from a book that many people see as a series for children. I also attended lectures about Ms. Rowling's ability to beautifully write the story, with every small detail connected to something else, for example, details in books by Jonathan Swift to Chaucer to Dickens and Austin. I learned that like all great books, Rowling's stories encouraged a connection across mind, body, and soul. Although the series has been criticized by those who believe it encourages bad behavior in children, I was able to hear discussions by those who claimed that these books teach wonderful messages if one gets its deeper meaning. It is my generation's shared text; all college freshmen are familiar with the stories, and that gives us a set of common beliefs and ideas that help us start to learn new things."

The flat is on the _ floor.	Hello, I'm Frank. I'm twenty-four years old. I live in Shanghai now. There are many tall buildings, big houses and busy streets in this city. My flat is on the eighth floor of a ten-floor building. There is a nice park. In the morning, there are many people doing exercise in it. My flat is small. It has no kitchen. There is only one bedroom. It looks nice and tidy. My favorite place is the balcony . I often sit on the balcony to have a rest . I work in a restaurant on a busy street. It is a good place to meet friends and taste nice food. I'm always busy cooking food and making coffee for the customers . When I'm free, I'll help the waiters clean the chairs and tables. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I'm happy here.	['eighth']
From the passage we can see that in our life, besides something material, we need something _ .	As we know, most of the material things in our daily life have to be bought with money. But money is not all powerful. Money can't buy many things such as time and true love. There are 24 hours in a day. Sometimes when we are very happy, we wish that the period of happiness would last longer. But no matter what we do, or how much money we are willing to pay, we cannot make a day last longer than 24 hours. On the other hand, when we are unhappy, money cannot make the unhappy time pass away more quickly. True love is another thing which money cannot buy. Suppose we have someone who really loves us very much. Once he dies, he can give us no more love. Can our money raise him from death and make him love us as before? Here we can see very clearly that money cannot buy us love. Money can buy us diamond things, beautiful clothes, but never time and love. So money, after all, is not all powerful.	['spiritual']
Which of the following does Tom probably agree with?	"Dear Mr./Ms, I would like to suggest that the starting time be changed at our school. Classes at Sebastian Valley Middle School simply start too early in the morning. Getting eight to nine hours of sleep each night is almost impossible when classes begin at 7:30 am. In order to shower, dress, get organized, eat a quick breakfast, and meet the school bus by 6:45, I would have to get up at 5:45. Early in the morning, students are too sleepy to learn well. Without enough sleep, young people cannot think clearly or enjoy learning. According to a report called ""Are Students getting Enough Sleep?"" From Sebastian Valley Times, ""Sleepiness disturbs concentration, reduces short-term memory, and causes bad feelings."" Researchers have learned that teens normally fall asleep and wake up later than adults. Teens who stay up late at night have trouble getting up early in the morning. Studies show that some schools have already adjusted school hours to better match the teen sleep cycle , as a result, students in these school are learning better on the new schedule . Some of my classmates argue that starting school an hour later will prevent them from taking part in after-school athletic programs. A solution would be to carry out these programs before school instead of after school. The students who are involved in sports and clubs would continue to arrive at the usual time. The rest of the student body could get a little more sleep and arrive an hour later. Teens usually have a later sleep cycle, and learn and behave better when rested. So I would like to suggest that we have a meeting to discuss the problem and listen to all the students' voice. Thank you for considering this request !"	['Sleep is food for the brain.']
He was a different man at home because _ .	"My grandfather was a teacher.He was the headmaster of a school for boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen.I know that he was a kind and gentle man at heart,because when I was young (and he was old),he gave me presents and seated me on his knees,and told me stories.But I believe the boys at his school were afraid of him. At school,when he walked into a classroom full of noisy boys,those boys went red in the faces,and looked down at their shoes.If a boy brought his poor,careless work,which was not the best that boy could do,my grandfather picked up the boy's work and threw it across the room,shouting,""Do it all again,and bring it back early tomorrow morning!"" If the boy was late,or if he forgot to bring the work,he had to do it again.My grandfather never forgot. He was a very different man at school,from the man I saw day by day in his own home."

Anjan thinks that we can get the meat protein from _ in the future.	3D printers are certainly the superstar today---they are being put to all kinds of uses, including creating model cars for movies. However, none of these ideas are as crazy as the one suggested by Anjan Contractor, who believes that they will be the key to ending world hunger . If you think that sounds a little crazy, you are not the only one, but after hearing scientists, the idea seems to become true. According to scientists, food will become _ expensive and possibly, even out of reach, for billions of people in the future. It means billions of people won't have enough food. This is where 3D printers may save the day. Anjan, an engineer says that the only way to support the large population will be to provide every kitchen with a 3D printer and print out meals. More importantly, it would be to make the basic food from things that we now do not think can be eaten. Anjan thinks that we could easily get the meat protein from insects . Similarly, the vegetable nutrition could be made from greens like grass. Would you want to try 3D printed food?	['insects']
When children stopped to look at the violinist, their parents _ .	"A man sat at a metro station in Washington DC and started to play the violin; it was a cold January morning. He played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time, since it was rush hour, 1,100 people went through the station, most of them on their way to work. Three minutes went by, and a middle aged man noticed there was musician playing. He slowed his pace, and stopped for a few seconds, and then hurried up to meet his schedule. A minute later, the violinist received his first dollar tip: a woman threw the money in the money box without stopping, and continued to walk. A few minutes later, someone leaned against the wall to listen to him, but the man looked at his watch and started to walk again. Clearly he was late for work. The one who paid the most attention was a 3-year-old boy. His mother tagged him along, hurried, but the kid stopped to look at the violinist. Finally, the mother pushed hard, and the child continued to walk, turning his head all the time. This action was repeated by several other children. All the parents, without exception, forced them to move on. In the 45 minutes the musician played, only 6 people stopped and stayed for a while. About 20 gave him money, but continued to walk their normal pace. He collected $32. When he finished playing and silence took over, no one noticed it. No one applauded, nor was there any recognition. No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the most talented musicians in the world. He had just played one of the most beautiful pieces ever written, on a violin worth $3.5 million dollars. Two days before his playing in the subway, Joshua Bell sold out at a theater in Boston where the seats averaged $100. This is a real story. Joshua Bell's playing in the metro station was organized by the Washington Post as part of a social experiment. The outlines were: in a common environment at an inappropriate hour: Do we enjoy beauty? Do we stop to appreciate it? Do we recognize the talent in an unexpected situation? One of the possible conclusions from this experience could be: If we do not have a moment to stop and listen to one of the best musicians in the world playing the best music ever written, how many other things are we missing?"""

Compared with cats and dogs, horses _ .	Dear Editors, On my way to work every morning I drive by a farm where I can see some horses off in the distance in the woods. They are there every single morning no matter how cold or rainy or windy it is. There is a shed on the farm, but it doesn't look to me that the horses are ever taken into the shed. Is this right? I don't think horses should be treated like this. Sam Dear Sam, Thanks for taking an interest in these horses. Problems about the care of horses are different from cats and dogs. Think of wild horses that spend their whole lives outdoors finding whatever food and shelter they can on their own. The point is that horses don't require as much shelter as a lot of other farm animals. However, that doesn't mean that they don't need some shelter. It is hard to tell from your letter whether the situation for these horses is unacceptable. Above all, do you know the people who own the horses well enough to just talk to them as a neighbor and express your concern ? Maybe they will tell you that the horses do go in the shed at night. If direct contact is not a choice and you can see that the horses' situation is poor, then call 911, report the situation and ask law enforcement officers to look into it. If you just can't see enough to prove such a report, call the Oswego Court Humane Society on 207-1070 for help from the Large Animal Assistance Project (LAAP). A volunteer from the project will help solve the problem. Speaking of volunteer assistance, since you appear to be a horse lover, why not talk to the LAAP about volunteer opportunities for you? It's big job, but totally rewarding, and the project always needs knowledgeable horse people to help.	['need less shelter']
The best title for the passage would be _	"Dear Michelle, Why can't my daughter manage her life better? She is 17 and an honor student, but she seems to be wasting her life away with a boyfriend who is holding her back. He consumes every waking minute of her precious time and smooth-talks her as well. His goal is to get her to agree to go to the college of his choice, not her choice, and because his grades are lower, his choice will be limited. I feel like I want to rescue her, but she pushes me away and shuts me out. She has only brought us pride and joy; and now this! Help! A worried mother Dear Mother of a 17-year-old Girl, Hmmmmm. What's the matter with kids today? Remember that song from ""Bye Bye Birdie""? Well if you do not, let me fill you in about teenagers and their life-management skills. Do not expect too much too soon because at the ripe age of 17, life-management is not within their reach, nor should it be. Life experience creates both the conditions and the skills for management, and if management went before experience, there would be little of it. Your daughter is an honor student for good reasons. She is smart, studies with intelligence and you have given her good values. When the time comes for her to apply for college, and she visits the ones that are specifically designed for students at the top of their grade, she will most likely break away from her boyfriend's influence. It is rare for an honor student to change the path of their academic career for _ . That being said, there might be some adolescent wisdom in her behavior after all. Perhaps she is choosing to worry you, her parents, for unconscious reasons. Being such a good girl and being a steady source of joy might have become a bit too much for her. Let your daughter have her own private moment of 11th grade rebellion. She deserves a break from perfection. Michelle"	['How can I help my girl?']

If you are thirsty and want to have a drink while sitting in the bus, you'd better _ .	The bus is a usable form of transportation all over the world because we can easily take it to go everywhere. Also, we do not need to worry about danger on a long-distance trip. Now, we have comfortable buses in London. I would like to describe how comfortable they are. First, the number of seats on a bus has been reduced from 44 to 19. The reason why the number of seats is now 19 is that the seats have been changed to big and comfortable sofas. Originally, they changed the normal seats to airplane seats and took out ten seats from the buses. However, every customer wanted to have a more comfortable seat on the bus when they went on long-distance trips, so they changed them to sofas. Also, the owners of the bus companies wanted to make more money, so they tried to meet the passengers' needs. They changed the airplane seats to sofas, so the number of seats is now 19. As the new buses appear, the prices go up, too. The owners have many ideas, which you have probably never thought about before. Now they have bus attendants who serve water, snacks, newspapers, and towels. Also, you can change the direction and the height of the sofa to make yourself more comfortable, and there is a service bell on each sofa. Moreover, some companies show movies on the buses. In addition, when you go on a long-distance trip, they have luxurious buses that have an LCD screen on each seat. That is not the only surprising thing on the bus. They also have different TV channels, movie channels, and seventy TV games for killing time while you are on the bus.	['ring the bell on your sofa']

When fish swims nearby, you can catch them with your hands. When you have tanks of air on your back, you can stay in deep water for a long time. But you must be careful when you dive in deep water. To catch fish is one of the most interesting parts of this sport. Besides, there are more uses for Skin-diving. You can clean ships without taking them out of the water. You can get many things from the deep sea. Now you can see that Skin-diving is both useful and interesting.	['you can take tanks of air with you']

Why do people prefer shopping online according to the author?	Recently, many shoppers chose to avoid the crazy crowds and do their holiday shopping from the comfort of their computer.Sales at online stores gained by more than 15%, making it the biggest season ever.But people are also returning those purchases at record rates, up 8% from last year. What went wrong? Is the shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to accept excessive addiction? Or that people shop more impulsively --and therefore make bad decisions --when online? Both arguments are seemingly reasonable.However, there is a third factor: a question of touch.We can love (lie look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of a texture , the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or, for that matter, the weight of an earring.And physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase. When my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I joined up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the difference between the online and offline shopping experience.I carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways.The first was a fairly hands-off approach.Whenever a customer would ask about my book, the volunteer would take them over to the shelf and point to it.Out of 20 such requests, six customers made the purchase. The second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and then holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer's hands.Of the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it.Just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales.Why? We feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we hold things in our hand.That's why we establish connection by greeting strangers and friends with a handshake.In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might produce a sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more. A recent study also showed the power of touch, in this case when it came to traditional mail.A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered ill a letter, as opposed to receiving the same message online.Brain images showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional center of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond.The study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession. This sense of ownership is simply not part of the situation in the online shopping experience.	['It is more comfortable and convenient.']
Ben Slye's attitude toward the volunteers' effort was that of _ .	"University of Maryland student Ben Simon and his friends couldn't stand to see good food thrown out on their campus.""We basically noticed that some of the extra food from the dining hall was going to waste at the end of the day.And we met with the dining services and asked them whether it would be okay if instead of throwing out the food we would donate it.And they were on board,"" he said. So 18 months ago,the students began what they call the Food Recovery Network.Each night,volunteers would show up at a campus dining hall to pick up leftovers and deliver them to area shelters and food banks.So far,they have donated more than 23 000 kilos of food that would otherwise have been thrown out. Nationwide,$165 billion worth of food is wasted each year,according to the National Resources Defense Council.Spokesman Bob Keefe says that is about 40% of the country's entire food production.""If we can reduce our waste in this country by 15%,we can feed 25 million hungry Americans.That is a huge benefit.That is what programs like this Food Recovery Network are doing,"" he said. Christian Life Center is one of the beneficiaries of the students' efforts.Ben Slye,the senior pastor ,said,""It has been just amazing to see these students take their own time,their own vehicles and own gas money and be able to make an effort like this.Each week we are able with this food probably to feed over hundred people."" The University of Maryland's Food Recovery Network now has 200 volunteers and the program has expanded to 18 schools across the country.""I want to grow 18 chapters to a thousand chapters within five years.And once we get to the Food Recovery Nation being at every college campus in America,we want to expand to restaurants and farms."" said Simon. The volunteers are committed to making that happen."	['appreciation']
"What did the author think of the ""junk"" he bought?"	"The first time I went for a walk around my father-in-law's neighborhood was garbage day, and I was shocked to see what people were throwing out. It was back in 1981, and I saw many people gathered in someone's front yard. As I went nearer to see what was happening I got my first introduction to yard sales. For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight. The following weekend, at another yard sale, I saw a 14-inch color1 TV being sold for almost nothing. I felt I could not miss the offer and bought it. Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to s. So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business. Every few months I would gather several boxes of American ""junk"" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home. As word got out about my father's ""trash"" market, people all came to buy these things. Three years later, when I visited my family for the first time since leaving home, I learned that many of the families in our neighborhood had a piece of ""trash"". It proved that I had the responsibility to keep people back home up to date with the latest technology you no longer need.(304words)"	['He thought they were valuable.']

In which country did not the researchers test the drinkable book?	"The expression ""a thirst for knowledge"" may soon have a new meaning for millions of people who have no way to get clean water. Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned. Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages. ""The idea of classic texts--that's of interest maybe later. We have discussed a little bit more exciting text. But we really haven't had the time to go through _ "" she says.

Some Prison Service guards died when they tried to _ .	"MEGADIM, Israel (AP)-The worst forest fire in Israel's history on Thursday destroyed one of the country's few forested areas, killing at least 36 guards on their way to rescue prisoners there, destroying homes and forcing the evacuation of thousands. The fire ran through the Carmel forest in Israel's Galilee, reaching the coastal city of Haifa, jumping from place to place in the forest. The fire broke out around midday and quickly spread and was still burning out of control as midnight approached. Investigators supposed that the fire could have been set accidentally, or it might have been a criminal act, but pretty much ruled out some sort of attack by a Palestinian group. ""This is a huge disaster,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""The government is using all means to control the fire."" He said some countries such as Cyprus, Italy, Russia and Greece agreed to provide backup. Most of the dead were Prison Service guards racing through the fire toward a prison to evacuate the prisoners, most of them Palestinians. A tree fell across the road, blocking their bus. Some guards were burned alive inside, while others died as they tried to escape. Fourteen bodies were found near the burnt bus 10 hours after the fire started. The fire heavily damaged one of Israel's few large forests, made up of natural growth and planted areas, a favorite place for camping and a home for dozens of species of wildlife. Forestry workers tried to evacuate animals from the fire. The forest recovered slowly from a fire in 1989, but experts said Thursday's big fire was many times worse."

The Diaoyu Islands are actually inhabited by _ .	"Six Chinese surveillance ships have entered waters near islands claimed by both China and Japan. China said the ships were carrying out ""law enforcement"" to demonstrate its jurisdiction over the islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. At least two of the vessels left after the Japanese coast guard issued a warning, Japanese officials say. The move came after Japan sealed a deal to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owner. Japan controls the uninhabited but resource-rich East China Sea islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan. The Japanese Coast Guard said the first two Chinese boats entered Japan's territorial waters at 06:18 local time (21:18 GMT Thursday), followed by another fleet of four other ships just after 07:00. The first two ships then left the area. A third ship left later on Friday morning, one report said. No force was used, Japanese officials added. ""Our patrol vessels are currently telling them to leave our country's territorial waters,"" the coastguard said in a statement. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that its ships were there. ""These law enforcement and patrol activities are aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,"" a statement said. The US has called for ''cooler heads to prevail'' as tension intensifies between China and Japan over the islands, which lie south of Okinawa and north of Taiwan. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is due to visit both Japan and China from this weekend as part of a tour of the region that also includes New Zealand. The dispute has seriously marred diplomatic relations between China and Japan and threatens to damage the strong trading relationship, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing. The row has also generated strong nationalist sentiment on both sides that observers say now makes it very difficult to be seen to be backing down, says our correspondent. The Japanese government says it is buying the islands to promote their stable and peaceful management. Its move followed a bid by right-wing Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara to buy the islands using public donations - an action that would likely have further provoked China. China, on the other hand, says the islands have historically been its territory and fishing grounds. Meanwhile Japan's newly-appointed ambassador to China, Shinichi Nishimiya, remains in hospital in Tokyo after he was found unconscious near his home in Tokyo on Thursday. No details have been given on his condition. He was appointed on Tuesday to replace Uichiro Niwa, who has been criticised for his handling of one of the worse diplomatic rows between Japan and China in recent years."	['Nobody']
Many people in Western countries may think black cats are _ .	"What do you think of black cats? Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. ""You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,"" Cathy Marden, a scientist said."

What can we infer from the text?	"My first full-time job after high school was selling vacation packages via the telephone for a well-known company. One day, I was put through to a man who sounded a bit out of breath. I started with my normal pitch , expecting to hear the normal reply --""I don't want any."" Instead, he spoke in a faint, weak voice and told me how he wished to take a vacation I was offering, but he couldn't because he was dying of illness. He explained how he was lacking in oxygen then, and it took almost all his energy to answer the call. He asked if I smoked, which I did, and begged me to stop. He told me smoking was what was killing him. He told me to spend every day with my loved ones, and tell them how much I love them. At this point, I couldn't control myself. We ended the call, but I held on my phone to prevent another call coming in so I could _ I wrote down his name and address, and sent him a card appreciating his advice and praying for him and his family. Shortly after, I received a letter from Frank, along with a picture of him and his wife. We continued to write back and forth over the next few months, and became very fond of each other. He was old enough to be my grandfather, and in many ways, I felt as if he was. About a year later I received a letter from his wife. When I started to read, tears came to my eyes. She told me how Frank's battle with the disease had finally come to an end, and he passed away shortly before the Christmas. She wanted to thank me for the letters to Frank, and explained how Frank touched many lives over the years. At his funeral, to show just that, they read the 1st letter I had written to Frank to show how he affected a 19-year-old he'd never met."	"[""There was something wrong with Frank's lung.""]"
According to the passage, what is the function of insulin?	"Have you ever noticed that people have thinner arms and legs as they get older? As we age it becomes harder to keep our muscles healthy. They get smaller, which reduces strength and increases the possibility of falls and fractures . New research is showing how this happens and what to do about it. A team of Nottingham researchers has already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age. When older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown. The research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. ""We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,"" Professor Rennie said. "" The results were clear. The younger people's muscles were able to use insulin we gave to stop the muscle breakdown, which had increased during the night. The muscles in the older people could not. In the course of our tests, we also noticed that the blood flow in the leg was greater in the younger people than the older ones,"" added Professor Rennie. However, scientists think that weight training may reactivate muscle blood flow and help retain muscles for older people. ""In fact, doing exercise three times a week over 20 weeks reactivates the leg blood flow responses of older people. They became identical to those in the young,"" said Professor Rennie."

Which of the following do you think is the best title for the passage?	Some people don't mind being fat. Other people can keep slim without any effort. But a lot of people do put on too much weight and don't like it. The question is, what can they do about it? Some believe exercise can be helpful. But the trouble is that it only makes you want to eat more. You might sweat out a couple of pounds playing tennis or climbing a mountain, but you put it all back on again with a big steak or bread and jam. A helpful way is food choosing. But what sort of food should you choose? Some believe that the less they eat, the slimmer they will be. They don't eat anything until they become weak with hunger. Some stick to milk and bananas. You'll find you need a lot of bananas, and unless you live where they grow, they aren't cheap. Others say that if you eat things like hard-boiled eggs, and apples with their skins on which are hard for your stomach to digest, the more you eat, the thinner you get. This is because you use up the fat in your body to get the energy to digest the food. For most of us these methods are too extreme. The simplest way is just to cut down on the carbohydrates that means not eating bread, potatoes, cakes, sugar, rice, and so on and eating anything else you like. It's straight forward and often quite effective.	['Food and Health']
How long had Jerry lived at the Children's Home by the time he met the writer?	"He came again the next day and worked until it was time to leave. His name was Jerry. He was 12 and had been at the Children's Home since he was only four. I thought of him. He was honest . For example, the handle of the ax broke one day. Jerry said the Children's Home would mend it. I handed him some money to pay for it. He wouldn't take the money. ""I'll pay for it, mama. I broke it. I didn't hit the wood in the right place. "" _ And it was a weak handle. I'll speak to the seller. "" It was only then that he would take the money. Another thing about Jerry was that he would do those little but helpful things. The things would not be badly needed but would make life so much easier. For example, he found a hole near the fireplace. ""I'll put some wood in the hole, mama. Then when a sudden storm comes up, you can stay warm. "" One cold day, Jerry sat close by me near the fire. We watched the fire bum. He suddenly talked of something he had never talked of before. ""You look like my mother, especially next to the fire"" But you were four, Jerry, 'when you came to live at the Children's Home. Do you still remember your mother?"""	['Eight years.']
How did the boy's teacher explain his success of the tournament?	"Sometimes your biggest weakness can become your biggest strength. Take, for example, the story of one 10-year-old boy who decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident. The boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three months of training, the master had taught him only one move.""Sensei,"" the boy finally said, ""shouldn't I be learning more moves?""""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,"" the sensei replied. Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training. Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy skillfully used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals. This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared _ . Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened. ""No,"" the sensei insisted, ""Let him continue."" Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament. He was the champion. On the way home, the boy and sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind. ""Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?"" ""You won for two reasons,"" the sensei answered. ""First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm."" The boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest strength."

The dollhouse game showed that the boy _ .	When I was 4, my parents decided they could no longer live together. That same year, my mom moved to Los Angeles (L.A.) and a therapist was hired to decide where I would live. Playing with a dollhouse in her office, I showed her the mother's room on one side and the father's room on the other. When she asked me about the little boy's room, I told her the little boy didn't know where to sleep. The therapist finally decided I would stay with my dad during the school years and visit my mom on long holidays and for summers. I began flying between two cities and leading two different lives. I remember my last school day in Grade Six. My friends made plans to go to the beach together, but I couldn't join them because I had to fly to L.A. It wasn't that I didn't want to see my mom and stepdad; I just didn't want to leave my friends. It wasn't easy to put up a wall, and pretend I didn't hate saying goodbye to them. In the morning, my dad drove me to school with my packed bags, and after school, my friends went together, and I went to the airport. What has come of this in the end is that I'm always missing somebody. When I'm in northern California, I miss my mom and stepdad, while in L.A. I miss going out with my friends, my dad, and my little brother and sister. But after so many flights, I've learned that it's also fun traveling between two cities and experiencing different lives. Other children may not have the opportunity to experience so much.	['had no feeling of belonging']
What makes each person different from anyone else except twins according to the passage?	While learning the science lessons, I used to get a doubt--why ear, nose, tongue and eyes should be called as special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we maintain contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connectivity. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a meal, but the hearing pitch does change after a heavy meal. We usually give credit of the taste to our tongue, but do you know that unless saliva dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something. Women are much better smellers than men. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly recognize the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different smells, which are strongly tied to the memories. Pupils do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a much delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can enlarge their pupils, change the focus and make their vision less clear. Each and every one of us has a particular or individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except the twins. This smell is very subtle yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this smell that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around.	['The particular smell of a person.']
Which of the following words can best describe the Hoverbike?	"Many people have long dreamed of being able to fly around as simply as riding a bicycle. Yet the safety and strength of a flying bike was always a big problem. Over the past 10 years, developments in technology have moved the dream of personal flying vehicles closer to reality. Now, two groups of inventors say such vehicles may be available very soon. Grant Stapleton from Malloy Aeronautics says the Hoverbike, which is able to get in and out of small spaces very quickly, will be a truly personal flying vehicle. ""It can be moved across continents very quickly because it can be folded and packed,"" he adds. Mr. Stapleton says safety was the company's main concern when developing the Hoverbike. He ays the designers solved the safety issue by using overlapping rotors to power the vehicle. The company is testing both a one-third size model and a full-size prototype of the Hoverbike. Inventors say their Hoverbike will most likely be used first by the police and emergency rescue teams. In New Zealand, the Martin Aircraft Company is also testing a full-size prototype of its personal flying bike, called Jetpack. It can fly for more than 30 minutes, up t0 1,000 meters high and reach a speed of 74 kilometers per hour. Peter Coker is the CEO of Martin Aircraft Company. He said Jetpack ""is built around safety from the start, "" In his words, ""reliability is the most important part of it. We have safety built into the actual structure itself, very similar to a Formula One racing car. "" Jetpack uses a gasoline-powered engine that produces two powerful jet streams. Mr. Coker says it also has a parachute that can be used should there be an emergency. ""It opens at a very low altitude and actually saves both the aircraft and the pilot in an emergency,"" he adds."

Children were always warned not to touch tomcat, because _ ?	"Everyone in the apartment complex I lived in knew who Ugly was. Ugly was the resident tomcat. Ugly loved three things in this world: fighting, eating garbage, and, shall we say, love. The combination of these things combined with a life spent outside had their effect on Ugly. To start with, he had only one eye and where the other should have been was a gaping hole. He was also missing his ear on the same side, his left foot appeared to have been badly broken at one time, and had healed at an unnatural angle, making him look like he was always turning the corner. His tail has long ago been lost, leaving only the smallest stub, which he would constantly jerk and twitch. Ugly would have been a dark grey tabby, striped-type, except for the sores covering his head, neck, even his shoulders with thick, yellowing scabs. Every time someone saw Ugly there was the same reaction. ""That's one UGLY cat!!"" All the children were warned not to touch him, the adults threw rocks at him, hosed him down, squirted him when he tried to come in their home or shut his paws in the door when he would not leave. Ugly always had the same reaction. If you turned the hose on him, he would stand there, getting soaked until you gave up and quit. If you threw things at him, he would curl his lanky body around feet in forgiveness. Whenever he spied children, he would come running, meowing frantically and bump his head against their hand begging for their love. If you ever picked him up, he would immediately begin suckling on your shirt, earring whatever he could find. One day Ugly shared his love with the neighbor's huskies. They did not respond kindly, and Ugly was badly attacked. From my apartment I could hear his scream and I tried to rush to his aid. By the time I got to where he was laying, it was obvious Ugly's sad life was almost at an end. Ugly lay in a wet circle, his back legs and lower back twisted grossly out of shape, a gaping tear in the white strip of fur that ran down his front. As I picked him up and tried to carry him home, I could hear him wheezing and gasping, and could feel him struggling. It must be hurting him terribly, I thought. Then I felt a familiar tugging, sucking sensation on my ear. Ugly, in so much pain, suffering and obviously dying, was trying to suckle my ear. I pulled him closer to me, and he bumped the palm of my hand with his head, then he turned his one golden eye towards me, and I could hear the distinct sound of purring. Even in the greatest pain, that ugly battled-scarred cat was asking only for a little affection, perhaps some compassion. At that moment I thought Ugly was the most beautiful, loving creature I had ever seen. Never once did he try to bite or scratch me, or even try to get away from me, or struggle in any way. Ugly just looked up at me completely trusting in me to relieve his pain. Ugly died in my arms before I could get inside, but I sat and held him for a long time afterward thinking about how one scarred, deformed little stray could so alter my opinion about what it means to have true pureness of spirit, to love so totally and truly. Ugly taught me more about giving and compassion than a thousand book lecture or talk show specials ever could, and for that I will always be thankful. He had been scarred on the outside, but I was scarred on the inside, and it was time for me to move on and learn to love truly and deeply. To give my total to those I cared for. Many people want to be richer, more successful, well liked, beautiful, but for me, I will always try to be Ugly."	['the tomcat was really dirty and nasty.']
You will _ if you use a computer to learn the language.	"Very soon a computer will be able to teach you English. It will also be able to translate any language for you,too. It's just one more incredible result of the development of microprocessors - those tiny parts of a computer commonly known as ""silicon chips"". So give up going to classes, stop buying more textbooks and relax. In a couple of years you won't need the international language of English. Already Texas Instruments in the United States is developing an electronic translation machine. Imagine a Spanish secretary, for example, who wants to type a letter from the boss to a businessman in Sweden. All he or she will have to do is this: first type the letter in Spanish. The letter will appear on a television screen. After a few seconds the translated letter will appear on another television screen in Stockholm in perfect Swedish. And that's not all. Soon a computer will be able to teach you English, if you really want to learn the language. You'll sit in front of a television screen and practice endless structures. The computer will tell you when you are correct and when you are wrong. It will even talk to you because the silicon chips can change electrical impulses into sounds. And clever programmers can predict the responses you, the learner, are likely to make. So think of it.You will be able to teach yourself at your own pace.You will waste very little time,and you can work at home.And if after all that,you still can't speak English,you can always use the translating machine.In a few years,therefore,perhaps there will be no need for BBC Modern English,or BBC English by Radio programmes - no more textbooks or teachers of English.Instead of buying an exciting new textbook,the computer will ask you to replace it with a microprocessor.Fast,reliable and efficient language learning and translating facilities will be available to you.Think of that,no more tears or embarrassing moments.One little problem is that a computer can't laugh yet - but the scientists are working on it.Happy learning!"

The reason why the toys most boys play with are different from those that girls play with is that _ .	There seems never to have been a civilization without toys, but when and how they developed is unknown. They probably came about just to give children something to do. In the ancient world, as is today, most boys play with some kinds of toys and most girls with another. In societies where social roles are strictly determined, boys pattern their play after the activities of their fathers and girls after the tasks of their mothers. This is true because boys and girls are being prepared, even in play, to step into the roles and responsibilities of the adult world. What is remarkable about the history of toys is not so much how they changed over the centuries but how much they have remained the same. It is the universality of toys about their development in all parts of the world and their continuing to the present that is amazing. In Egypt, the Americas, China, Japan and among the Arctic peoples, generally the same kinds of toys appeared. Nearly every civilization had dolls, little weapons, toy soldiers, tiny animals and vehicles. Because toys can be generally regarded as a kind of art form, they have not been subject to technological progress that characterizes inventions for adult use. The progress from the wheel to the oxcart to the automobile is a direct line of advancement. The progress from a rattle used by a baby in 3,000 BC to one used by an infant today, however, is not characterized by inventiveness. Each rattle is the product of the artistic tastes of the times and subject to the limitations of materials then ready for use. (words: 285 ; time : 5ms)	['their social roles are strictly determined']

Beginning college can be an exciting but awkward time. Follow these tips to adjust to your new life rapidly and make the most of your college experience. * To save time and money, use the college's bus system. Taking the bus to school is quick, easy and free in most college towns. You won't have to locate or afford a place to park either. It's also a good way to be environmentally aware. * Save pennies on books by waiting until class starts. You might not even need all of the recommended books. New textbooks cost an arm and a leg. Try buying used textbooks -- it's a surefire way to save money and serves the purpose as well. * Do never look at college life as an endless series of parties and social activities. But there is a whole lot more to college if you're serious about graduating. Having a good college experience is all about balancing work and fun. * Be aware that your living environment can largely affect your academic success. If the dorm doesn't suit you, consider living at home with your family or renting your own apartment. The best location for your studies isn't always your dorm. Find a quiet area, like the library, to do your work. Alternatively, buy some headphones that block out noise. * Be mindful of your diet. Make healthy food choices and watch what you eat. Avoid foods that are processed or high in sugar. The ""freshman 15"" is real. Many college students gain at least 15 pounds during their freshmen year. * While electives can be helpful when figuring out your major, you shouldn't entirely rely on them.

. How will researchers improve these high-tech clothes?	Clothes can make phone calls, play music, dial your pal's number, keep you warm during cold weather and operate your computer? This is not a fantasy. A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a wide range of clothes -- clothes that have minds of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a kind of fabric that can be blended with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result are electronic garments. If you think the wearer has to be wired to different devices, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 percent shock proof, they say. The Electrotextiles team has also created the world's first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These 'lap- tap' gadgets are all set to take over laptop computers! Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably with others at the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim jacket with flexible earphones sewn into the hood and the electronic ski jacket with a built-in heater. The ski jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning system and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids. Having completed the cloth keyboard, scientists have already started to work on a new project--a necktie that can be used as a computer mouse. What is the next? Do you have any idea?

Madden arrives shortly after 6 am to prepare her classroom and work on the school breakfast program. ""My family all went to St. Teresa's School,"" she says. ""I always said, 'One day, I'm going to come back and get one of those big desks.'"" With a watchful eye always on the lookout for ""one of those big desks"", Madden returned to St. Teresa after graduating from college and taught second grade at the Olneyville neighborhood elementary school until it was burnt in a fire in 1990 and had to be closed. Madden then went to Holy Ghost School where she started as a second-grade teacher and then moved up one grade level. ""I take care of setting up and serving breakfast,"" she says. ""In winter it is still dark when I arrive here."" Madden praises Holy Ghost School Principal Carol Soltys and the school's workers for their continued support. ""It's a family,"" she said. Her class is small this year with 15 students, including some from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Haiti, Guatemala, Nigeria and Ghana. Madden admits that she's encouraged by her former students, now grown-ups, who want their own children to enjoy a similar experience in a safe, good environment. ""They tell others, 'I send my child to Eileen Madden's School, '"" she adds."	['Eileen Madden decided to be a teacher when she was young.']

Why didn't the old man ask the previous riders for a ride?	"It was a bitter cold evening in northern Virginia many years ago. The old man's beard was glazed by winter's frost while he waited for a ride across the river. The wait seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid north wind. It was long before he heard the faint, steady rhythm of hooves along the frozen path. Anxiously watching several horsemen coming up, he let the first one pass by without any effort to get his attention, then another passed by, and another. Finally, the last rider drew near where the old man sat like a snow statue when old man caught his eyes and said, ""Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side?"" Stopping his horse, the rider replied, ""Sure! Jump aboard."" Seeing the old man unable to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman got down to help him. The horseman took him not just across the river, but to his destination just a few miles away. As they approached the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's curiosity caused him to inquire, ""Sir, I noticed you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. Then I came up and you immediately asked me for a ride. I am curious why, on such a bitter night, you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you here?"" The old man looked the rider straight in the eyes and replied, ""I reckon I know people pretty good. I looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately found no concern for my situation. It would have been useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I looked into your eyes, your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need."" Those heart-warming comments touched the horseman deeply. ""I'm so grateful for what you have said,"" he told the old man. ""May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion."" With that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House."	['Because he assumed they had no concern for him.']
Why WAZA is not pleased with Wonderful Friends?	"The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as ""cute pets"". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create ""entertaining"" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly. WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes."	['The programme showed no respect for animals.']
What can we learn from the passage?	Anyone driving the twists of Highway 1 between San Francisco and Los Angeles recently may have glimpsed a Toyota Prius car with a curious-looking thing on the roof. Harder to notice was that the person at the wheel was not actually driving. The car is a project of Google, which has been working in secret but in plain view( anyhow, no one can keep such a thing from the public) on vehicles that can drive themselves, using artificial-intelligence software that can sense anything near the car and imitate the decisions made by a human driver. With someone behind the wheel to take control if something goes wrong and a technician in the passenger seat to monitor the navigation system , seven test cars have driven 1,000 miles without human intervention and more than 140,000 miles with only occasional human control. One even drove itself down Lombard Street in San Francisco, one of the steepest and curviest streets in the nation. The only accident, engineers said, was that one Google car was rear-ended when it stopped at a traffic light. Autonomous cars are years from mass production, but technologists who have long dreamed of them believe that they can transform society as profoundly as the Internet has. Robot drivers react faster than humans, have 360-degree perception and do not get distracted or sleepy, the engineers argue. They speak in terms of lives that could be saved and injuries that could be avoided--- more than 37,000 people died in car accidents in the United States in 2008. The engineers say the technology could double the capacity of roads by allowing cars to drive more safely while closer together. Because the robot cars would eventually be less likely to crash, they could be built lighter, reducing fuel consumption. But of course, to be truly safer, the cars must be far more reliable than, say, today's personal computers, which crash on occasion and are frequently infected. The Google research program using artificial intelligence to revolutionize the automobile is proof that the company's ambitions reach beyond the search engine business. The program is also a departure from the mainstream of innovation in Silicon Valley, which has turned toward social networks and Hollywood-style digital media. However, the Google researchers said the company did not yet have a clear plan to create a business from the experiments.

According to the passage, a humanoid robot, put on the ISS, shall carry out the tasks except _ .	"TOKYO--Lonely astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) may soon be getting a robot friend from Japan. Japan's space agency is considering putting a talking humanoid robot on the ISS to watch the work while astronauts are asleep, monitor their health and stress levels and communicate to Earth through the microblogging site Twitter. Japan's space agency JAXA announced this week that it is looking at a plan to send a humanoid robot to the space station in 2013 that could communicate with the ground through Twitter--primarily feeding photos, rather than original ideas --and provide astronauts with ""comfort and companionship"". Following up on US NASA's ""Robonaut"" R2 program, which is set for launch on the Discovery shuttle next week, the Japanese robot would be part of a larger effort to create and refine robots that can be used by the elderly, JAXA said in a statement. Japan is one of the leading countries in robotics and has a rapidly aging society with one of the world's longest life expectancies. Improving robot communication capabilities could help elderly people on Earth by providing a nonintrusive means of monitoring the robot owner's health and vital signs and sending information to emergency responders if there is an abnormality, JAXA said. ""We are thinking in terms of a very humanlike robot that would have facial expressions and be able to talk with the astronauts,"" said JAXA's Satoshi Sano. The robot was being developed with the advertising and communications giant Dentsu Inc and a team at Tokyo University. The NASA project has a humanlike head, hands and arms and uses the same tools as station crew members. The ""Robonaut"" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station's Destiny lab. NASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans. For now, the $2.5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab."	['get a friend for astronauts from Japan']
What is the subject discussed in the passage?	"Several years ago, I had a huge falling out with one of my best friends. So huge, in fact, that now I can't even remember what happened. In the past nine years, I've seen her twice, and each time we've been polite but distant. And that troubles me because we were once inseparable. I'd like nothing more than to go back nine years, and continue our friendship. But how? How do you reconnect with friends you've lost throughout the years? Linking to your past The desire to reconnect with lost friends isn't unusual. Why? Because friends link us to the past. "" _ ,"" says Sandy Sheehy. Although you can share information about your past with friends you've met recently, you don't have a shared history with them. So you wind up only telling them about your past, rather than sharing it with them. But many people never try to reconnect. Women especially have trouble taking the first step. Shyness or fear that the other person doesn't want to reconnect often stops many women. And that shouldn't be. Your friends probably want to be in touch with you as much as you want to be in touch with them. Searching for friends Fortunately, finding lost friends isn't as difficult as it once was, thanks to tools like the Internet. Our experts offer these suggestions for locating contact information: Search Internet sites designed to locate people like classmates.com and switchboard.com. Contact your high school or college alumni office to request current address information. Surf online yellow pages. Check current phone records from your friend's hometown. Network with other friends who might have known your friend. Get in touch with any of her relatives, if you know where they live. If you know where she works, find the company's website and search the directory of personnel."	['How to rebuild friendship.']
The A&E department is incredibly busy because _ .	"A hospital has been forced to ban Pokemon Go players from the site after a monster hub was found in the A&E department. Royal Stoke University Hospital discovered that its casualty unit is on the same spot as a Pokemon Go 'gym' ---- where players can train their newly caught Nintendo creatures. The University Hospitals of North Midlands Trust agreed last week that patients can play Pokemon Go on wards because walking around is healthy. But the Trust has been forced to post a warning on its website about public access to A&E. It said if Pokemon Go becomes a major annoyance it would ask Nintendo---- which decides on the locations of the virtual gyms according using GPS----to have it removed from the premises . Kevin Parker, associate chief nurse, said, ""Members of the public who do not need to be at Royal Stoke should not attempt to enter A&E or any other part of the hospital building to play the game. The A&E department is incredibly busy this summer. We want the public to understand that anybody who visits the hospital solely to play the game will provide an unwanted distraction to the important work of the hospital. I'm also aware of various reports in the media of unsafe areas that the game has been played in."" ""Royal Stoke University Hospital is a safe area where gamers can enjoy Pokemon Go."" Michelle Harris, the Trust's manager, said the game could still be played by those already in hospital. ""We recognize that the Pokemon Go game encourages walking and exercise, which is something that the Trust is equally keen to promote,"" she said. There are a number of ""walking routes"" established throughout the Trust that can be used to combine walking and playing the game. ""Walking just 30 minutes, five times a week, can help reduce the risk of preventable illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease."" There have been several warnings about the game since its UK release. Last week a group of teenagers in Wiltshire were left stranded almost 100ft underground after they got carried away searching for Pokemon Go characters. The four boys, aged 16 and 17, ended up getting lost and had to wait to get a phone signal before they could call for help. Eventually, they contacted Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue team, who took them to safety. Damien Bence, of the fire and rescue team, said: ""Pokemon Go is obviously leading people into dangerous situations."""	"[""players' arrival disturbs the work of the A&E department""]"

What do we know about the Snow Castle?	"Jamie Wardley is a special kind of artist - an ice sculptor. He first trained as a sand sculptor. Later, he learned about ice sculpture. Now he does sand sculpture in the summer. And in the winter, he sculpts ice. When sculpting ice, Wardley has to work in cold temperatures. If the weather is cold enough, he can work outside. But winter in the United Kingdom is not always very cold. So often he works in a large freezer where the temperature is about -12degC. Wardley enjoys sculpting ice outside in the winter. When he sculpts in the open air, people can watch. They can be part of the creative process. Wardley makes ice sculpting sound simple. But the tools Wardley uses are sharp and dangerous. And the ice is very heavy. Each block of ice weighs 120 kilos. And some larger sculptures are made from several combined blocks of ice. Sometimes ice sculptures can be as big as buildings. In Kemi, Finland there is an ice hotel called the Snow Castle. Each year, Wardley helps build the Snow Castle. Inside the Snow Castle, the temperature is -50C. Even the dining tables are made of ice. So you have to wear winter clothes when eating and wear a hat when sleeping. ""The ice hotel is built every year in January. Then it melts in April. Each year we rebuild it and create a new design,"" Wardley said. The Snow Castle is a large and amazing work of ice, but Wardley's smaller ice sculptures are special too. One winter, in the city of Bradford, UK, Wardley created several small sculptures. He used the sculptures to tell a story which contained an important message about good will and understanding. Ice sculptures are temporary works of art. When the temperature rises, they will melt. But that does not mean that their beauty is lost. The sculptures from that day in Bradford have now melted away, but their message of good will, understanding, and acceptance remains."	['It requires to be built every year.']

What do you think the players have in common?	"Five teens from Sarasota, Florida, are making music from garbage. The Garbage-Men band's instruments are made from recycled objects. The guitars are boxes. A horn is made from pipes. The keyboard is formed from old bottles. The band started about two years ago. Jack Berry decided to make a playable, homemade guitar. After some trial-and-error, he ended up building it from a cereal box, a yardstick and toothpicks. After Jack showed his creation to his friend Ollie Gray, Ollie had the idea to form a band using other homemade instruments as a way to promote recycling. ""We want to show people there is more to recycling than throwing things away in the bin ,"" Jack, 16, said, ""You can actually reuse materials."" Ollie, 15, plays drums made from trash cans. Evan Tucker, 15 (bass guitar); Harrison Paparatto, 15 (horns and violin); and Austin Siegel, 15, (keyboard), round out the band. The Garbage-Men plays at local events around Sarasota, including festivals, farmer's markets and community fundraisers. Typically, the teens will set up on the street and perform popular songs from the 1960s, including classic Beatles tunes and people's favorite ""Wipe Out,"" by The Surfaris. In between sets, they talk about recycling the offer tips for how to help the environment. while they perform, Jack's little brother Trent, 11, gives out flyers about recycling and helps sell the band's CD and other merchandise. The band donates the money from sales to charity. They have raised more than $2,500 for Heifer International. The organization gives farm animals, seeds and agricultural training to people in poor countries to help end poverty and hunger. The band--all tenth graders--tries to play a gig for America's Got Talent. The teens hope to eventually take their show on the road by touring in other states. ""Music is a really good way to get a good message across to people because it's really accessible,"" Jack says. Their instruments may be garbage, but their message isn't."

Whose conducting was ASIMO made to copy?	"The lights dimmed,the musical hall grew quiet and out walked the conductor shiny and white and 4 feet and 3 inches tall. ASIMO, a robot designed by Honda Motor Co., met its latest challenge Tuesday evening: Conducting the Detroit Symphony , in a performance of ""The Impossible Dream"" from ""Man of La Mancha"". ""Hello, everyone,"" ASIMO said to the audience in a childlike voice, then waved to the orchestra. As it conducted, it perfectly mimicked the actions of a conductor, nodding its head at various sections and gesturing with one or both hands. ASIMO took a final bow to excited shouts from the audience. Later, cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined ASIMO onstage to receive an award for his efforts in music education. Honda spokeswoman Alicia Jones says it is the first time ASIMO has conducted an orchestra, and it may be the first time any robot has conducted a live performance. But ASIMO has its limits. ASIMO's engineers programmed the robot to mimic Charles Burke, the Detroit Symphony's education director, as he conducted the piece in front of a pianist about six months ago. But it can't respond to the musicians. ""It's not a communicative device. It simply is programmed to do a set of gestures,"" said Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra's musical director. ""If the orchestra decides to go faster, there's nothing the robot can do about it. Hopefully, I keep that under control."" But several musicians also said ASIMO was more realistic than they expected. ""The movements are still a little stiff , but very humanlike, much better than I thought,"" Hutchinson said."

Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"You may think, salt is just a simple cooking element we shake on our food for a little extra taste. But salt is much more than that. Without salt our muscles would not move. Our nervous systems would not operate. Our hearts would not beat. But do not think rubbing salt in a wound will help. Doing that would be painful and not heal the wound. To rub salt in a wound is an idiom that means to purposefully make a bad situation worse. Early humans got the salt they needed to stay alive from the animals they killed. But advances in agriculture led to a diet low in salt. So, humans needed to find other sources. Those who lived near the ocean or other natural sources for salt were lucky. Those who did not had to trade for salt. In fact, people used salt as a method of payment in many parts of the ancient world. The word ""salary"" comes from the word ""salt"". Salt also played an important part in population movement and world exploration. Explorers understood that if they could keep food fresh,they could travel longer distances. So they used salt to preserve food and explored the world. Salt was so important that, according to food historians. it was traded pound-for-pound for gold. Today, people still use the expressions ""to be worth one's salt"" or ""worth one's weight in salt"". The expressions describe a person of value. A person might also be called salt of the earth. That description means he or she is dependable and trustworthy. However, when you say ""I think we should take what he said with a grain of salt"" you mean you accept it but maintain a degree of doubt about its truth."	['Salt Is More Than a Four-letter Word.']

Which of the following expresses the main idea of the text?	"MADRID (Reuters)--Spain' s parliament voiced its support on Wednesday for the rights of great apes to life and freedom. Parliament's environmental committee approved resolution urging Spain to carry out the Great Ape Project (GAP), designed by scientists and philosophers who say our closest genetic s deserve rights limited to humans. ""This is a historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defense of our evolutionary comrades, which will doubtless go down in the history of humanity,"" said Pedro Poza, Spanish director of the Great Ape Project. The new resolution has cross-party support and it is thought they will become law within a year, making Spain the first nation to extend legal rights to apes. Under the new law, potential experiments on apes in Spain will be forbidden. ""We have no knowledge of great apes being used in experiments in Spain, but there is currently no law preventing that from happening,"" Poza said. Keeping apes for circuses, television commercials or filming will also be forbidden.Housing apes in Spanish zoos, of which there are currently 315, will remain legal, but supporters of _ have said the conditions in which most of them live will need to improve vastly. Philosophers Peter Singer and Paola Cavalieri founded the Great Ape Project in 1993, arguing that ""non-human hominids "" should enjoy the rights to life and freedom and not to be mistreated."

What change in attitude took place in Athens?	"Freedom and Responsibility Freedom's challenge in the Digital Age is a serious topic. We are facing today a strange new world and we are all wondering what we are going to do with it. Some 2,500 years ago Greece discovered freedom. Before that there was no freedom. There were great civilizations, splendid empires, but no freedom anywhere. Egypt and Babylon were both _ , one very powerful man ruling over helpless masses. In Greece, in Athens , a little city in a little country, there were no helpless masses. And Athenians willingly obeyed the written laws which they themselves passed, and the unwritten, which must be obeyed if free men live together. They must show each other kindness and pity and the many qualities without which life would be very painful unless one chose to live alone in the desert.The Athenians never thought that a man was free if he could do what he wanted. A man was free if he was self-controlled. To make yourself obey what you approved was freedom. They were saved from looking at their lives as their own private affair. Each one felt responsible for the welfare of Athens, not because it was forced on him from the outside, but because the city was his pride and his safety. The essential belief of the first free government in the world was liberty for all men who could control themselves and would take responsibility for the state. But discovering freedom is not like discovering computers. It cannot be discovered once for all. If people do not prize it, and work for it, it will go. Constant watch is its price. Athens changed. It was a change that took place without being noticed though it was of the extreme importance, a spiritual change which affected the whole state. It had been the Athenian' s pride and joy to give to their city. That they could get material benefits from her never entered their minds. There had to be a complete change of attitude before they could look at the city as an employer who paid her citizens for doing her work. Now instead of men giving to the state, the state was to give to them. What the people wanted was a government which would provide a comfortable life for them; and with this as the primary object, ideas of freedom and self-reliance and responsibility were neglected to the point of disappearing. Athens was more and more looked on as a cooperative business possessed of great wealth in which all citizens had a right to share. Athens reached the point when the freedom she really wanted was freedom from responsibility. There could be only one result. If men insisted on being free from the burden of self-dependence and responsibility for the common good, they would cease to be free. Responsibility is the price every man must pay for freedom. It is to be had on no other terms. Athens, the Athens of Ancient Greece, refused responsibility; she reached the end of freedom and was never to have it again. But, ""the excellent becomes the permanent"", Aristotle said. Athens lost freedom forever, but freedom was not lost forever for the world. A great American, James Madison, referred to: ""The capacity of mankind for self-government."" No doubt he had not an idea that he was speaking Greek. Athens was not in the farthest background of his mind, but once man has a great and good idea, it is never completely lost. The Digital Age cannot destroy it. Somehow in this or that man's thought such an idea lives though unconsidered by the world of action. One can never be sure that it is not on the point of breaking out into action only sure that it will do so sometime."	['The Athenians refused to take their responsibility.']
The passage focuses on _ .	In the United States, the number of children affected by divorce grows by about one million each year. As the number increases, experts continue to debate the effects of divorce on children. Some experts say divorce is harmful to children. Some studies show that children of divorce have more problems. For example, some children of divorce are more often aggressive toward parents and teachers. They have a greater risk of leaving school before completing their studies. They have more health and learning problems. However, experts note that these problems are not necessarily caused by divorce alone. During the 1970's, many Americans believed that divorce was the best solution for married people who were not happy. People did not think divorce would harm children. They thought children would go through a period of change when their parents ended their marriage. Then the children would be all right. These beliefs have changed in recent years. Researcher Judith Wallerstein studied more than one hundred children of divorce over a twenty-five-year period. She says some children never recover from divorce. She says they often have problems with their own adult relationships as a result of their parents' divorce. Ms. Wallerstein says her study proves that parents should stay together for their children, even if they are unhappy. However, some people say that children suffer more in a situation where there is much conflict. They say it is better for children to live with one divorced parent than to live with two parents who are angry and unhappy. Other experts note that many children of divorce do not have serious problems. This is because their parents are able to deal with the situation in a responsible way. Experts say that some people who get divorced are able to put the needs of their children first. They say that they are able to show the children that their love and support will continue after the divorce.	"[""whether children suffer from parents' divorce""]"
Who got money in the story ?	"One day Mrs Black visited her family doctor, Mr Dodd. Mr Dodd was an old funny man with a beard. ""What's the problem ?"" the doctor asked her.

Jane Austen paid two long visits to Bath _ .	Jane Austen, a famous English writer, was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on December 16, 1775, and died on July 18,1817. She began writing early in life, although the prejudices of her times forced her to have her books published anonymously. . But Jane Austen is perhaps the best known and best loved of Bath's many famous local people and visitors. She paid two long visits during the last five years of the eighteenth century and from 1801 to 1806, Bath was her home. Her deep knowledge of the city is fully seen in two of her novels, Northanger Addey and Persuasion, which are largely set in Bath. The city is still very much as Jane Austen knew it, keeping its streets and public buildings the well--ordered world that she described so well in her novels. Now the pleasure of learning Jane Austen's Bath can be enhanced by visiting the Jane Austen Center in Gay Street. Here, in a Georgian town house in the heart of the city, you can find out more about Bath in Jane Austen's time and the importance of Bath in her life and work. The Center has been set up with the help and guidance of members of the Jane Austen Society. After your visit to the Center, you can look round the attractive shop, which offers a huge collection of Jane Austen related books, cards and many specially designed gifts. Jane Austen quizzes are offered to keep the children busy. You can also have walking tours of Jane Austen's Bath, which is a great way to find out more about Jane Austen and discover the wonderful Georgian city of Bath.

His English and math are very good. He often helps other students with their English and math. Our teachers like him very much. We go to school together by bike in the morning. We have lunch at school. After school in the afternoon, we often play sports. We play soccer and baseball. In the evening, he does his homework at home. Sometimes he watches soccer games on TV. On Sundays, he goes out with his parents in his father's car. They play in the park and do sports there. Sometimes my father takes me there, too. We play sports together. We have a good time.

What is the author's intention in writing this story?	During my travels through the mountains of Greece, I was only ever scared once. It was dusk and as I walked alone I came across six large wolves that were feeding on the body of a dead animal. I had heard many stories about wolves as a child and it was this animal that I feared more than any other. The wolves before me were huge, at least 6 feet long and covered with thick grey fur. As I went near, the wolves left the blood-covered snow that surrounded the body and started walking towards me, one after another. They stopped about 20 metres from me and stared. The lead wolf raised his head into the air and took in a deep breath, as if he was smelling my presence. The animals looked both beautiful and frightening, but I knew I could not show them my fear. As I drew nearer, the lead wolf raised its head once more but this time let out a long, loud cry. The awful cry rang out across the silent valley. I had never heard a more frightening sound. I was almost certain it was a sign to be death. Every moment I expected to see the pack of wolves dash at me, I knew my only hope was to pretend I had no fear. I walked past the line of wolves, like a general moving among his soldiers. They cried out loud again. But when they saw that their cry did not cause me to change my direction or make me run they feared to come after me, so they let me pass and returned to the dead animal. If I had turned back or tried to run away when they marched out to meet me, I am certain the whole pack would have attacked me in a moment. But my show of false courage scared them and kept them back.	['To stress the need for courage when in danger.']
The title of this passage may be _ .	Some students think it difficult to learn English well. That's because they don't find the right way. I think reading is very important for students. The more you read, the better you'll understand. Reading is helpful to listening, speaking and writing. If you often read English aloud, you'll improve your listening. On the other hand, listening a lot can help you to read better. Reading English everywhere when you are free, if you wish. You can get a lot of knowledge when you read. Sometimes you need to express your ideas, you can either speak or write. That means you are using what you learned from reading. The same as Chinese, the more you read, the better you can write. If you want to remember something, you should read again and again. So from now on, you'd better do more reading. It's a good way to learn English well.	['Reading is important']
The reason for the land that turns into deserts is mostly because of _	The size and location of the world's deserts are always changing. Over millions of years, as climates change and mountains rise, new dry and wet areas appear. But within the last hundred years deserts have been increasing after frightful speed. This is partly because of natural changes, but most responsible for creating deserts are men. Man can make deserts, but they can also prevent them from getting bigger. Algeria is planning a green belt of trees along the edge of the Sahara Desert to stop the sand. In China, too, _ are being built in the northwest to keep the desert from growing. But desert still threaten the world. Experts believe that land that is on the way to becoming deserts equals the size of Australia, Russia and US put together. Can we stop the spread of the world's deserts and save the land that is so essential to mankind? Yes, we can, and we must.	['man']
What do you think was the three Frenchmen's real trouble?	One day three Frenchmen who did not know English very well were talking about the English language. The first Frenchman said, 'I heard someone shout 'look out' ,I put my head out of a window and a basin of water fell on me. It seems that 'look out' may mean 'don't look out!' The second one followed, ' I was once on a ship and heard the captain shout, 'All hands on the deck ' I put my hands on the deck and someone trod on them.' The third one told his friends his experience too, 'One early morning I called on my English friend and the maid said, 'He is not up yet, come back in half an hour.' When I went again for him, she said, 'He's not down yet.'I said, 'If he's not up and he is not down, where is he then? What a strange language it is!'

Which of the following is cause and effect?	"Cause and effect is one way to explain things that happen around us. Many things happen because something caused or influenced them to happen. Sometimes it is hard to look at a cause and find out what caused or influenced them to happen. Sometimes it is hard to look at a cause and find out what causes the effect. It may help you to start with the effect and use your reasoning skills. Think about all the things you know that could be reasons for the effect you can see. For example, you may see someone putting on a heavy jacket. This is the effect. To look for a cause, think to yourself, ""What would take someone put on a heavy jacket?"" Maybe the person is going outside into very cold weather. Maybe the person works in the penguin pen at Sea World. Maybe the person is going to visit an ice skating rink where the air is kept very cold. All of these things could be a cause for putting on a heavy jacket. Now, think about a second example. The effect is a boy named Abi has to go to the head teacher's office. What are the possible causes? Maybe he bullied another student. Maybe he is just being picked up early. Maybe he is being given a prize! Here is another example for you to think about its cause and effect. Cait, 13, was trying to fall asleep when her 8-year-old brother, Doug, came into her room. He looked around a bit, but seemed really out of it. Then Doug went back into the hallway and stood there looking straight up at the hall light for quite a while. Little brothers can be very strange, but this was really much too strange. Cait's father appeared and explained that Doug was sleepwalking. What's the cause end effect, could you tell? ,."	['Tim was late again and his teacher got angry.']
Which of the following is true according to the text?	"Scientists have tried to come up with biological explanations for the difference between boys and girls. However, none were believable enough to explain the general picture. As one scientist points out, ""There are slight genetic differences between the sexes at birth which may affect the subjects boys and girls choose. But the difficulty is that by the time children reach school age, there are so many other effects that it is almost impossible to tell whether girls are worse at science and maths, or they've been brought up to think of these subjects as boys' 'territory' "". Statistics show that in mathematics, at least, girls are equal to boys. A recent report suggests that girls only stop studying mathematics because of social attitudes. One of the reports' authors says, ""While it is socially unacceptable for people not to be able to read and write, it is sill acceptable for women to say that they are 'hopeless' at maths. Our research shows that, although girls get marks which are as good as the boys' , they have not been encouraged to do so."" The explanation for the difference, which is very clear during the teenage years, goes as far back as early childhood experiences. From their first days in nursery school, girls are not encouraged to work on their own or to complete tasks, although boys are. For example, boys and not girls, are often asked to 'help' with repair work. This encouragement leads to a way of learning how to solve problems later on in life. A further report on maths teaching shows that teachers seem to give more attention to boys than to girls. Most teachers who took part in the study admitted that they expect their male students to do better at mathematics and science subjects than their females students. All of this tends to encourage boys to work harder in these subjects, gives them confidence and makes them believe that they can succeed. Interestingly, both boys and girls tend to regard such 'male' subjects like mathematics and science as difficult. Yet it has been suggested that girls avoid mathematics courses, not because they are difficult, but for social reasons. Mathematics and science are mainly male subjects, and therefore, as girls become teenagers, they are less likely to take them up. Girls do not seem to want to be in open competition with boys. Neither do they want to do better than boys because they are afraid to appear less female and less attractive."	['It is a social problem rather than a problem of brains that girls are poor at maths.']
What could the straight-talking repairman have said to the author?	"Only after the straight-talking repairman handed me the bill and waved goodbye did I finally acknowledge the painful truth: Our 20-year-old clothes dryer was not going to last. I turned to my husband. ""He says we're throwing good money after bad,"" I sighed. ""I think he's right."" ""When do you want to go shopping for a new one?"" my husband asked. I glanced out the window, admiring the sunlight dancing on the big-leaf maples in our backyard. Perfect drying weather. Suddenly, I recalled my mother hanging laundry on a clothesline during my childhood. My sister and I had played hide-and-seek among the sweet-smelling sheets waving in the wind. I suddenly had a plan. After the wash cycle, we covered the maples with damp blue jeans, shirts, socks and towels. The only things that didn't go outside were my underpants. And I persuaded my shameless husband to let his big boxer shorts stay indoors, too. There is a secret pleasure to hanging laundry outdoors. It is the perfect excuse to get up from the computer. While checking on the laundry in the backyard, I could commune not only with cotton T-shirts, but also my cats. I could watch cautious deer run through the yard with their young, listen to nervous squirrels in trees and observe a family of wild turkeys by the road. I returned to my desk refreshed. And, except for the sandpaper feel of sun-dried bath towels, the drying method was a complete success. When autumn came, I'd scan the horizon each day to evaluate the chances of sun-drying. One morning I saw rain clouds. I had a load of wet clothes in my arms and no place to put them. I found my husband. Together we hung laundry throughout the house. Then my husband gave me a hug and a smile. ""I think it's time to buy a dryer..."" he said, ""... like, today."" ""Good idea,"" I said, just as the infamous Oregon rain started. Our sun-dried laundry habit was finished for the season."	"['""You shouldn\'t have wasted money on repairing your dryer.""']"
The passage is written mainly to _ .	"Many women write to me perplexed about why they can't form close friendships. They try new approaches, put themselves in all the right places, see therapists, and read relevant self-help books. They consider themselves interesting, loyal, kind and friend-worthy people. But for reasons unknown to them, they have a tough time forming intimate relationships. Many admit to not having even one close friend. A recent study published in the offers some clues as to how both nature (personality) and nurture (experience) impact our friendships. Researchers at the University of Virginia and University of Toronto, Mississauga studied more than 7,000 American adults between the ages of 20 and 75 over a period of ten years, looking at the number of times these adults moved during childhood. Their study, like prior ones, showed a link between residential mobility and adult well-being: The more times participants moved as children , the poorer the quality of their adult social relationships. But digging deeper, the researchers found that personality--specifically being introverted or extroverted -- could either intensify of buffer the effect of moving to a new town or neighborhood during childhood. The negative impact of more moves during childhood was far greater for introverts compared to extroverts. ""Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to maintain long-term close relationships,"" stated Dr. Shigehiro Oishi, the first author of the study, in a press release from the American Psychological Association, ""This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily. Less outgoing people have a harder time making new friends."" Families often have to relocate -- across town, across the country, or across the globe. Yet, in many cases, their kids and young adolescents haven't yet built up a bank of friendships. So the conventional wisdom is to try to minimize moves for the sake of your child, whenever possible , and to move at the end of the academic year."

Exercise makes the _ move quickly and smoothly.	Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. This is an old English saying. Do you know it before? It says that we must go to bed early and get up early in the morning. Then we should be healthy. We should also be rich (wealthy) and clever (wise). This is true. The body must have enough sleep to be healthy. Children of a young age should have ten hours' sleep every night. Children who don't have enough sleep can't do their work very well. They will not be wise and they may not become wealthy! The body also needs exercise. Walking, running, jumping, swimming and playing games are all exercise. Exercise keeps the body strong. Exercise also keeps the blood moving around inside the body. This is very important. Our blood takes food to all parts of our body. The head also needs blood. Exercise helps us to think better!

Queen Elizabeth's four children are called _ .	Queen Elizabeth II is not only the queen of the United Kingdom, but she is also the queen of other 16 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Jamaica. Her face is seen on stamps and coins all around the world. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in London on April 21st1926. Her parents were George, the Duke of York, and Elizabeth, the daughter of the Earl and Count-ness of Strathmore. As a child, Princess Elizabeth lived with her parents and younger sister in London and Windsor. Every summer, she traveled to Scotland to visit her mother's parents. She was interested in all sorts of sports, but her favorites were horse riding and swimming. She was also fond of acting, art and music. As princess Elizabeth grew older, she started to play a part in British public life. When she was 14, she broadcast a radio message to all the children of Britain and the Common-wealth . Two years later, she carried out her first public engagement, and started to go on official tours shortly after that. After a tour to South Africa in 1946, she married Philip Mountbatten. The couple had four children: Prince Charles, born in 1948, Princess Anne, born in 1950, Prince Andrew, born in 1960 and Prince Edward, born in 1964. After her father died, Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony held in London in 1953. As a queen, she has many duties, and leads a very busy life. She travels throughout the world, meeting the leaders of other countries, and attends a large number of official functions. She also holds a meeting every week with the British Prime Minister. Every year, on Christmas Day, she broadcast a message to the people of British and the Commonwealth, talking about her hopes for the future. Queen Elizabeth has been on the throne for more than 40 years and has become one of the most famous women in the world. Lots of people in British believe that she tries hard to understand her people and be a good queen. More than her title, this quality has earned her much love and respect.

The writer thinks English is interesting because _ .	I often hear some students say English is difficult, and it gives them a headache. But English is very easy for me. I'm good at it. I'm very glad to tell you something about how I study English. First, I think an interest in English is very important. When I learned English first, it was fresh for me. I was interested in it, so I worked hard at it. Soon we had an English exam and I got a very good mark. How happy I was! After that, I learned English harder and harder. Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, and the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is! Second, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary. Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question. I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand! Besides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well. And I also write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.	['his teacher often teaches them nice English songs']
The intended readers of the passage are _ .	"Watching a child struggle to breathe during as asthma attack is frightening for any parent. So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called "" questionable utility. "" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections. So make sure you understand what the cause of your child's asthma really is."	['parents']
The passage is probably taken from a(n) _ .	What a great Paralympic Games this has been. An outstanding Opening Ceremony, splendid athletic performances in perfect stadiums, the best-ever Paralympic Villages, amazing high definition television coverage, a never ending and self-generating supply of passion and emotion, superb organization, wonderful volunteers, millions of new Paralympic sports lovers both here in China and around the world. These are the greatest Paralympic Games ever. --Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympic Committee It was another spectacular show. Perhaps it's not quite as sublimely beautiful as the opening, but a fitting end to what has been a memorable 12 days in the Chinese capital. The Paralympics were inspiring. Not only the Paralympians themselves, but also the warmth of people in Beijing and the sense of self-respect among the disabled in China that these Games seem to have inspired, as well as a new attitude in general from the government and form Chinese society as a whole. -- Jeff Z. prefix = st1 /Klein,New YorkTimes It doesn't get any better for disabled persons living in Beijingthan September 2008, with increased access for them in public areas. But there are still problems. Some taxi drivers are not willing to pick up wheelchair users. Some companies deliberately break employment laws that ask them to employ a percentage of disabled persons. Many schools haven't opened their door to disabled students. During the past Paralympics, Chinese society has witnessed firsthand the abilities of disabled persons in sporting. And the next step will be for the abilities of disabled people on the Paralympics to be translated into a realization of their abilities to study, work and go about daily life in a barrier-free society. -- Eric Roeder, China Daily	['newspaper']

Dr. Jack M. Gwaltney conducted the experiment in order to _ .	"Dr. Jack M. Gwaltney, Jr. a professor at the University Of Virginia School Of Medicine infected six student volunteers with virus, the most common cause of colds. A few days later, when they were coughing and sneezing, he gathered 37 more people and divided them into three groups. Group 1 members spent three days and nights in the same room with one of the infected students, separated by a screen so they couldn't touch one another. Group 2 sat around a table while an infected volunteer talked, coughed and sang to them. Group 3 held hands with an infected student for ten seconds, and then touched their own noses or eyes. Although most scientists at the time, the mid-70s, believed colds were spread by virus-laden droplets spread through the air when infected people coughed or sneezed, Gwaltney suspected physical contact might play an important role. Sure enough, of the 15 people who had touched a student volunteer, 11 became infected--compared with only one of those who had been sitting at the table, and none who had spent three days and nights together. ""The best evidence we have is that hand-to-hand contact is the most efficient way of transmitting virus,"" says Gwaltney. The study was one of a series that helped establish Gwaltney's reputation as a leading authority. Dr. Robert Couch says, ""It would not be inappropriate to call him Mr. Common Cold."" When Gwaltney is asked how close scientists are to finding a cure, he replies: ""If you mean 'get rid of', I don't think we're going to be able to do that with cold viruses any time soon. But if you look in the dictionary, you'll see that 'cure' is explained as a successful treatment. And we're not just getting more effective at treating the symptoms --we're getting at the root cause too. """	['find out the role physical contact plays in the common colds']

From the passage we can find out _	Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?	"Anyone who has ever traveled with a teenager knows that the teenager can make the vacation good or bad for the entire family. As a travel agent, Lynda Maxwell said, ""If teenagers are happy, everybody is happy."" Teenagers are often interested in travelling, but their interests and schedules often aren't the same as their parents'. It means that when the parents start to look for a place of interest in the early morning, their teenagers may be sleeping soundly! The thing makes travelling with teenagers very difficult, but it isn't impossible. The experts said, ""The keys to success is what parents do before they travel."" For many families, the hardest part may be finding a vacation time that is right for everyone. Be sure to sit down with everyone else in the family before setting a date. ""After setting a date, ask teenagers where they would choose to go,"" suggested Maxwell. It is possible that they'd like nothing more than to sit on a beach for a week. ""Maybe there's a compromise ,"" said Maxwell. ""Most teenagers like using the Internet now, so parents can ask them to think up the ideas about what to see and do,"" said Brad Anderson.

The author believes that by challenging discomfort, one may _ .	"Comfort is comforting, but it might narrow our experience at work -- and beyond. In our modern world, discomfort is considered a terrible thing. If not terrible, at least a thing of the past. Dishwashers, washing machines, computers, remote controls--yes, they add convenience, but also a level of comfort our forefathers did not enjoy. As pain of any kind discourages happiness, we tend to reason, anything that compromises our ability to feel good must be bad. And that's also particularly true for our careers. Success makes us feel great, not terrible. Such a view, however, is a matter of personal opinion. And it may blind us to hidden opportunities. Artists throughout history have tried to experience suffering, instinctively if not consciously, to produce works that explore the darker hidden sides of the human condition. This was done, in part, because pain is a reality of life for everybody in some form at some time. Pain is something everybody can relate to. And pain makes a person very present. For such artists, to relieve or to deny pain would be to block the creative thinking, which drives them to explore and express. In fact, Germans have a term for this melancholia, "" _ "", which means ""suffering from the world."" Writers, from Lord Byron to Kurt Vonnegut, have used the term to describe the psychological pain encountered along life's roller-coaster journey. It was not to be avoided; it was to be understood, investigated and employed. So I propose that discomfort is good for us. Or, put another way, it tells us that something needs to be addressed. It stretches us by forcing us to view our circumstances through a wholly different lens. Because we're drawn to safety and security, we do our best to create pleasant comfort zones for ourselves and our loved ones through the cars we drive, the homes we live in, and the places we work. But by resisting discomfort, we deny ourselves an important opportunity: the chance to shake ourselves out of our predictable perspectives and allow ourselves to make knowledgeable observations we could not possibly have made before. Discomfort gives us fresh eyes."	['judge and think about the world in a new particular way']
Which is true ?	There are some places in the world where great cities once stood. There were trees, gardens and grass. But now these cities have gone and the places are like deserts. Scientists began to study this land to find out what happened. Many of them believed the land died when the trees were cut down. Trees help other plants grow and help hold the soil in place. They keep the soil from blowing away. The leaves of trees on the ground keep rainwater from running off. Trees near farms protect growing plants from strong winds. Once there were hundreds of farms in the southwestern United States. Then the farms turned into fields of dry dust. Trees might have saved these farms. But few trees grow in the dry southwest now. Now we try to save trees. In many places, when a tree is cut down , a new tree is planted in its place . We do not want the land to die.	['Land will die if there are no trees .']
In Camilla Kring's opinion, B-people _ .	"A group of people from Denmark have formed the B-Society. According to them, human beings are divided into types: A-People, and B-People. A-People have no problem getting up in the morning, and operate much better earlier in the day. However, B-people are better later in the day. ""I'm useless early in the morning,"" says one of the members of the B-Society.""All I can do is drink coffee, and stare into space. People used to get up early because they had to feed the animals. But I haven't got any cows or chickens, so I can sleep late,"" She adds. Since the society was set up, the B-Society has welcomed several thousand members. Right now, the B-Society is fighting hard for businesses to join its B-certification list. Companies that are ""B-certified"" basically give their employees the opportunity to come in when they want. In some companies, employees arrive at any time up to 3:30 pm --- each to their own rhythm . And it is not just businesses that are benefiting from this. Teenagers who can't get out of bed in the morning, and parents who never quite get the kids to school on time, can now benefit from B-classes. From next year, a school in Copenhagen will offer classes which start later in the day (at 10 instead of eight). And even the government seems to like the idea. The B-Society was founded by Camilla Kring, a professor from the University of Copenhagen. On her website, she says, ""When B-people's work rhythms are considered at the work place, their productivity and quality of life is increased, which can increase productivity for the entire organization."" She adds that, ""B-Society will create a new daily rhythm in schools and other institutions as an alternative to the current rhythm of 'early at work and early at home'. We are working for the establishment of kindergartens, primary and secondary schools as well as universities that open between 10 am and 8 pm."" Would you like to work for a B-certified company?"

There are three main forms of pollution: land pollution, air pollution and water pollution. Land pollution is caused by solid waste, such as cans, bottles and some plastic things which aren't broken down quickly. It makes the environment look very bad. However, air pollution is more serious than land pollution. It is much worse in cities and towns because of the fumes from traffic and the waste from human activities. When people drive their cars, fumes which are most made up of CO2, NO2 and SO2 are given off. After the gases get into the air, they may mix with clouds. Then they will become some harmful chemicals falling on the ground with rain. It is one of the reasons for soil erosion which is one example of water pollution. Various kinds of pollution will cause many health problems. People have realized they must change this serious situation. There are many ways to control pollution. To develop alternative energy is very popular in many countries. China, for example, has made up its mind to be a leader in this field. It is trying hard to make full use of energy from the sun and wind. It has paid plenty of money to make electric cars and trains instead of traditional traffic. We should also take action to make our environment cleaner every day. Take cloth bags while going shopping and drive cars less. We have only one earth. We must take steps now to help protect our environment for the future wherever we are.	['drive a car out every day']
From this passage we know Rose believed _ .	"On the first day of school our teacher introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know.I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a little old lady with a warm smile.She said, ""Hi, handsome.My name is Rose.I'm eighty-seven years old."" ""Why are you in university at such a YOUNG age?"" I asked.She replied, ""I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of kids, and then retire and travel."" I knew she was joking.I was curious what might have encouraged her to be taking on this challenge at her age. ""I always dreamed of having a university education and now I'm getting one!"" she told me.We became friends.Every day we would talk nonstop after class.I always enjoyed listening to this ""time machine"" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.And Rose easily made friends wherever she went. At the end of the term we invited Rose to make a little speech.She cleared her throat and began, ""We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing.I've learned a few secrets to staying young, being happy, and achieving success.You have to laugh and find humor every day.You've got to have a dream.When you lose your dreams, you die."" ""There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up.Anybody can grow older. _ doesn't take any talent or ability.The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change..."""

What does the writer think of his achievement?	"My teacher, Mr. August J. Bachmann, was the most influential teacher I ever had. I had gotten into trouble in his class: Another student had pushed me for fun, and I became angry and began to hit him. Mr. Bachmann stopped the fight, but instead of sending me to the office, he sat me down and asked a simple question: ""Penna, why are you wasting your life? Why aren't you going to college?"" I didn't know anything about colleges or scholarships. No one had ever considered that a fatherless boy from the poorest neighborhood had a future. That day, instead of rushing off for lunch, he stayed and explained possible education options to me. At the end of our talk, he sent me to see a secretary who had a child at a state college. This was in 1962 at Emerson High School in Union City, New Jersey. Well, 53 years have passed, and what have I done with the knowledge he gave me? I gained a PhD from Fordham University when I was only 29. I taught English and social studies and then moved up the chain of command from teacher to principal. I've sat on the board for Magnet Schools of America and represented that organization at the United Nations. I've won a number of great educational awards. But where would I be if a truly caring teacher had not taken the time out of his lunch period to speak to me? It was without question only his confidence in me that helped me forward. I have repaid his kindness hundreds of times by encouraging misguided youngsters to aim higher. If I have saved any children, it is because of him. If I have been a successful educator, it is because I had a great role model in Mr. Bachmann."	['He owes his achievement to Mr. Bachmann.']
What does the article mainly talk about?	"Swimming in the water of Hawaii's Big Island is a fun experience. But it can be more exciting if there are dolphins swimming around and jumping out of the sea too. For many people, it would be a wonderful dream to swim with these lovely animals! However, this may not be good for dolphins. They may get hurt because of human interaction . Dolphins are active and usually look for food at night. In the day, they like to rest in shallow bays . Many people think the dolphins are awake during the day as they swim. But when they sleep they rest half of their brain and keep the other half awake to breathe, so they may be sleeping even when they're swimming in the water. From 2010 to 2013, spinner dolphins of Hawaii's Big Island were exposed to human activities more than 82 percent of the time, according to Julian Tyne, a researcher at Australia's Murdoch University. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says disturbing the animals in their near-shore habitat could force them to swim to less favorable places, putting them at risk of attack by sharks and other animals. Besides, when people are around, dolphins become more active. Thus, they can't get enough sleep. ""Disturbing their resting behaviors can actually affect their long term health and the health of the dolphin population,"" Ann Garrett of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service told the Associated Press. As a result, the NOAA wants to make rules to help protect the dolphins. For example, the agency may ban swimming with the Hawaii spinner dolphins. Or they may stop people from swimming in shallow bays when the dolphins are resting. Tour operators must also be taught to watch for signs to know when the dolphins are in their resting state."

An important factor in a game of imperfect information is _	Decision-thinking is not unlike poker --it often matters not only what you think, but also what others think you think and what you think they think you think.The mental process is similar.Naturally,this card game has often been of considerable interest to people who are,by any standards,good thinkers. The great mathematician John von Neumann was one of the founders of game theory.In particular,he showed that all games fall into two classes:there are what he called games of 'perfect information', games like chess where the players can't hide anything or play tricks:they don't win by chance,but by means of logic and skills.Then there are games of 'imperfect information', 1ike poker,in which it is impossible to know in advance that one course of action is better than another. One mistaken idea about business is that it can be treated as a game of perfect information.Quite the reverse.Business,politics,life itself are games which we must normally play with very imperfect information.Business decisions are often made with many unknown and unknowable factors which would even puzzle best poker players.But few business people find it comfortable to admit that they are taking a chance,and many still prefer to believe that they are playing chess,not poker.

What happened to Picasso's work after a long time?	"What do you see when you look at abstract art? Does it make sense to you? Does it look like anything? Abstract art became popular in the early 20th century. Artists did not want to paint, draw, or sculpt things like they looked. They didn't want their art to be realistic . They were more interested in basic shapes and colours. Picasso is probably the most famous of these artists. He painted and drew in many, many styles. Sometimes he used a lot of blue colours (his ""blue period""). Later, he used more red and pink colours (his ""rose period""). Many of his other paintings are called ""cubist "" because they are made of painted squares. After a long time, Picasso's paintings became more and more abstract. He painted people and things using strange shapes. His work was so original, many his fellow artists didn't understand it. Kindinsky, another famous artist, used lines, shapes, and patterns to paint his subjects. His paintings also used strong colours to express feelings. Other artists like the surrealists , they were interested in the subconscious . Painters like Breton and Magritte used many symbols in their work. The meaning or subject of their work wasn't always clear. Dai, another artist, painted pictures that looked like dreams. There are still many abstract artists around the world. It's often hard to say what their art is about. That's the way many artists like better. They want each person to look at art and find their own meaning in it."	['It became more abstract.']
What do we know about the author?	"What do you remember about your childhood? I have good memories of exploring the fields near my house and riding my bike around the park. Today, children don't spend enough time in the fresh air. Many of them fix their eyes on a screen either on a computer, or a TV ---they seem to be living in a _ world. They have lost touch with nature. Now 400 organizations in the UK are encouraging children to have some ""wild time"". They want kids to exchange at least 30 minutes of watching TV or playing computer games for time playing outside. The simple pleasures of exploring and discovering nature help children to learn and keep fit too. Andy Simpson, who is part of the campaign , says: ""An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors."" Even if the kids live in a city, they can go on adventures in the garden or the park. However, children often need a helping hand from Mum and Dad. They need to be shown what to do and where to go. So despite the complex world that young people grow up in now, it seems that going back to basics and experiencing ""nature's playground "" is what modern children need. Andy Simpson adds: ""We want parents to see what this magical ""playground"" does for their kids' development , independence and creativity , by giving wild time a go "" . David Bond from Project Wild Thing says, ""We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. """	['He had a happy childhood by exploring the outdoors.']
Which of the following would be the best title for the text?	"""The Heart of the Matter,"" the newly-released report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for attaching the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. Regrettably, however, the report's failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good. In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by federal states and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others to maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. In response, the AAAS formed the Committee on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the Committee's 51 members are top-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as distinguished figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism. The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because the government supports full literacy of citizens, the report stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the introduction of a series of curricula that improve students' ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning into practice on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs. Unfortunately, despite 2 years in the making, ""The Heart of the Matter"" never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. The committee ignores that for several decades America's colleges and universities have produced graduates who don't know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing ""progressive"". Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas--such as free markets and self-reliance--as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legal intellectual investigation. The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well hold back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to clarify."

From the story, we know the writer wanted to see Jesus _ .	"I was saved from sin when I was going on thirteen. But not really saved. It happened like this. There was a big revival at my Auntie Reed's church. Then just before the revival ended, they held a special meeting for children, ""to bring the young lambs to the fold "". My aunt spoke of it for days ahead. That night I was accompanied to the front row and placed on the mourners' bench with all the other young sinners, who had not yet been brought to Jesus. My aunt told me that when you were saved you saw a light, and something happened to you inside! And Jesus came into your life! And God was with you from then on! She said you could see and hear and feel Jesus in your soul. I believed her. So I sat there calmly in the hot, crowded church, waiting for Jesus to come to me. I wanted to see him, but nothing happened to me. Nothing! I wanted something to happen to me, but nothing happened. Now it was really getting late. So I decided that maybe to save further trouble, I'd better lie and say that Jesus had come, and get up and be saved. So I get up. The whole room broke into a sea of shouting and my aunt threw her arms around me. The minister took me by the hand and led me to the platform. That night I cried. I cried, in bed alone, and couldn't stop. My aunt woke up and told my uncle I was crying because the Holy Ghost had come into my life, and because I had seen Jesus. But I was really crying because I couldn't bear to tell her that I had lied, that I had deceived everyone in the church, that I hadn't seen Jesus, and that now I didn't believe there was a Jesus any more, since he didn't come to help me."

From the passage we learn that in Brazil _ .	Carnival does not take place only in Louisiana. There are many celebrations around the world. In Brazil, the celebration is supposed to go on from the Saturday before Mardi Gras to Mardi Gras Day, but in some Brazilian cities the celebration can last seven or eight days. Just like New Orleans, not many important things are decided in Brazil from New Year's Day to Mardi Gras Day because everyone is preparing for or celebrating carnival. Most Brazilian parades have a subject, which could be political or historical. The parades had to have a subject related to Brazil until 1996. Some cities in Brazil do not have a street carnival, but they might have an indoor party. Bolivia has carnival parades for children and then more parades for adults. The children dress up in costumes and march in the streets. The adults make traditional dance groups and dance in the streets. But the main part of Bolivia's carnival is getting wet. Almost everyone gets wet from water balloons and water buckets. In Oruru, Bolivia, their carnival is held in the last ten days of the carnival season. People there join in dancing, but their main carnival event is a ceremonial parade that lasts for twenty hours and parades for four kilometers. Over 20,000 dancers are involved as well as 10,000 musicians. This parade attracts at least 400,000 people. The carnival in Venice, Italy is often regarded as the most carefully prepared carnival and lasts ten days before Lent . Many events are held in the canals including shows, concerts, dances and water processions . The official ending to the celebration is the party held in St. Mark's Square.

It's impolite to ask British people _ .	"The 30th Olympics will be held in London soon. More and more people will travel there and watch the games. And it's necessary for the tourists to know the customs there. Here are some tips given by William Hanson, an English manner expert. * Afternoon tea. The traditional view that the British sit down for an afternoon tea is not popular any more. Few people keep the tradition nowadays. * Give tips -- but not in a clear way. The British would like to choose a quiet way of saying ""thank you"" when they get good service. In fact, many British waiters will not mind if you decide not to tip at all. * Greeting with a kiss. The British aren't like their neighbors in France. They do not greet others with a kiss very often. Many people prefer to shake hands or pat on the back to say "" hello"" . * Conversation tips. If you are not sure what you are talking about, end a sentence with the word ""mate"". * Don't talk about money. According to Hanson, British people don't like to talk about money and it is rude to do so. Especially, never ask anyone how much money he or she makes a month."	['how much he or she makes a year']

As soon as she bought what she wanted, the writer _ .	"I went into Harrods in London (a huge department store I am sure you have heard of) to buy some Minton china plates for a wedding anniversary which was to be a group gift from friends to other friends in Geneva. Having only 30 minutes between meeting. I whizzed there in a taxi from the office and battled through the milling people on the 2nd day of the sales on the ground floor up to the 5th to the china department. There was a man standing there who was obviously a sales person who I rushed up to and asked if he had this particular china in stock and if it would take long to wrap, etc. He was amazing. He got the plates in seconds, wrapped them up and asked me if I wanted a store card, to which I replied no, because I lived in Switzerland, to which he replied asking if, as I lived abroad, would like a tax rebate form . After that he showed me what to do, produced a map of the store and told me where I should go for the formalities . That was fabulous! I thanked him and said what wonderful service he had given me. I even asked if he gave this to everyone, to which he answered: ""I'm just doing what is required at Harrods"". With that, a tall man in a gray suit approached me and offered his hand to shake mine saying, ""Can I introduce myself? I am the Chief Executive of Harrods and what an interesting conversation I have just heard..."" He had been wandering through the store (as you should do as a hands-on CEO) and had overheard me thanking this salesman, whose face, I can hardly describe, was frozen in a mixture of delight awe and astonishment! Can you imagine the salesman going home to his family and friends recounting what the CEO spoke to him after overhearing him being praised by a customer?"	['went to a meeting.']
Visitors who have the unusual experience of sleeping at the Poseidon resort can _ .	If you plan on visiting to Fiji, you are probably looking for some fun things to do. Below are four unusual places. The Poseidon Resort The Poseidon resort is an underwater resort that gives visitors a beautiful view of sea life. This resort covers 255 acres. It's covered and surrounded by a lagoon that covers 5,000 acres and is about 90 feet under water, giving you a beautiful view of sea life right before your eyes. This resort even has a hotel for those who would prefer to have the unusual experience of sleeping and waking up to the beautiful scenery all around them. The Sabeto Mud Pool If you're looking for something unusual to do, you can't pass up the mud pool at Sabeto. It is located in a mountain range with a huge group of Geothermal pools full of nice, warm mud. Getting down and into the mud in the pool is believed to have benefits for healthy skin. This is unusual, but adults and especially kids will love it. Fire Walking Fire walking in Fiji is believed to have originated on the island of Beau. Fire walking is when you walk on white-hot stones barefoot. To do this, you have to be mentally prepared for it. Trust me; there is a lot of preparation and strict rules that travelers follow in order to do this safely. The Fiji Museum The Fiji museum is unusual due to all the amazing _ you'll see dating back 3,000-4,000 years. This museum has a certain attraction that makes it funny--a shoe. It's been said that a man named Thomas Baker was eaten by the locals several centuries ago and the only thing left was his shoe. This museum is a great idea if you bring the whole family to Fiji.

The students' attitude towards the fourth period on each Tuesday afternoon is _ .	"Liu Jiaoyang,16,carefully winds a bobbin with thread, places it on her sewing machine and then presses her foot down to begin sewing. While she's doing this,she pretends to guide cloth through the machine. Each Tuesday afternoon,after the bell rings for the fourth period, Liu becomes a fashion designer. At the same time,the rest of the students at the High School Attached to Yunnan Normal University in Kunming are also having classes a little bit different from the usual ones. Some students dance,others create robots,and still others review films. These are just a few of the 28 elective courses the school began to offer last month. ""The fashion design class has become the bright point of my week. I learn how to choose color1s and cloth as well as sewing and sketching skills. It's all helping me to realize the dream of becoming a fashion designer I've had since I was a little girl,"" Liu said. Design is Liu' s passion,but for other students the electives are more an opportunity to take a fun course that relieves the pressures of schoolwork. Some students,for example,are learning how to play bridge. Chen Xiejiao,15,is one of them. ""Many people think that playing a card game like this in class is a waste of time. But in fact,bridge is a very challenging game that helps develop memory and math skills,"" she said. Li Ke,15, is studying robotics. ""I hope to have built and designed my own robot by the end of the semester. It will be able to complete a task,like moving a bail from one place to another,"" he said ."	['both B and C']
How did the author make up for what he had done?	"It was a cold night in Washington, D.C., and I was heading back to the hotel when a man approached me. He asked if I would give him some money so he could get something to eat. I'd read the signs: ""Don't give money to beggars as most of them are _ ."" So I shook my head and kept walking. I wasn't prepared for a reply, but with no hesitation, he followed me and said, ""I really am homeless and I really am hungry! You can come with me and watch me eat!"" But I kept on walking. The incident kept bothering me for the rest of the week. I had money in my pocket and it wouldn't have killed me to hand over a dollar or two even if he hadn't been a real beggar. On a freezing cold night, no less, I assumed the worst of a fellow human being. Flying back to Anchorage, I couldn't help thinking of him. I tried to reason my failure to help by supposing government agencies, churches and charities were there to feed him. Besides, you're not supposed to give money to beggars. Somewhere over Seattle, I started to write my weekly garden column for The Anchorage Daily News. Out of the blue, I came up with an idea. Bean's Cafe, a local charity service kitchen, feeds hundreds of hungry local people every day. Why not try to get all my readers to plant one row of vegetables or flowers in their gardens for Bean's? Plant a row for Bean's. It's clean and simple. We didn't keep records back then, but the idea began to take off. Folks would fax me or call when they took something in. It's food for the spirit and comfort for my conscience. In April 1995, the Garden Writers Association of America(GWAA) held their annual meeting in Anchorage and after learning our program, Plant a Row for Bean's became Plant a Row For The Hungry. The idea then was to have every member write or talk about planting a row for the hungry, which brought the program to national attention. As more and more people participated, new variations cropped up. Many companies gave free seeds to customers and displayed the logo for the program. Donations poured in. It was then that I could really stop feeling guilty."	"[""He initiated the idea of Plant a row for Bean's.""]"
Why did she do this?	"One day we invited some friends to dinner. When it was about six o'clock, my wife found that we had little bread. So she asked our five-year-old daughter, Kathy, to buy some. 'Here's a dollar,' my wife said, 'get two loaves of bread, if they have it. If they don't have it, get anything. But hurry!' Kathy hurried off, and we waited and waited. By a quarter past six, all the friends had arrived. But Kathy had not returned. Finally we saw her dancing around the corner with a bright new hula hoop whirling round her middle. ""Kathy!"" her mother cried. ""Where did you get that hula hoop, and where is the bread?"" ""Well, when I got to the shop, they had sold out all their bread,"" answered Kathy. ""And you said 'If they don't have that, get anything!'"""	['All the above']
The seeds brought back from space produce _ vegetables according to the passage.	Space vegetables are grown from seeds that have been taken to space and brought back to the earth. The seeds are affected by the radiation and low gravity in space. When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy. Here are some facts that you should know about space vegetables. Space vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen. When seeds are brought back from space, they are tested to make sure that they will be safe to eat. Space vegetables are better for you than normal vegetables. For example, space tomatoes stay fresh for twenty days, which is one week longer than normal tomatoes. After genetically modified food appeared in the market, people worried that they were eating unknown things. For example, if nut genes are put inside potatoes, people allergic to nuts might get sick from eating these potatoes because they do not know they are also eating nuts. Unlike genetically modified food, space vegetables have not been genetically changed. This means that no new genes are put into the vegetables. Therefore, there are no dangers of eating something unknown.	['healthier and bigger']

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	Diwali is perhaps the most well--known of the Hindu festivals. It is celebrated by Hindus in India and abroad. It is often called the Festival of Lights. For Hindus, Diwli is very important and it is also very exciting time for them. Normally , this holiday is celebrated in October or November and it falls on a different date each year. This year , it will be celebrated on October23. Diwali is usually celebrated for 5 days. To prepare for Diwali, Hindus spend several weeks cleaning their homes and preparing special food in order to welcome Laskhmi, the goodness of wealth into their lives. They will open the windows of their homes during this time to make sure that she can enter their home. One of other traditions of Dawali is to light up oil lamp in the homes. The oil lamps are used to make the goddess of wealth enter the homes. Hindus believe that she will not enter a home that is not lit up. During Diwali, the children in India do not have to go to school. They share gifts with one another and prepare special holiday meals to celebrate this event. Fireworks are also a big part of the Diwali festival. They are used to scare away bad spirits.	['Lakshmi is a kind of oil lamp.']

The writer's attitude toward graffiti is that graffiti _ .	Almost anywhere in the world, you can probably see graffiti . Although it's usually more common in big cities, it can be found in almost any community, big or small. The problem with graffiti art is the question of whether it's really art. This isn't always an easy question to answer, simply because there are so many different types of graffiti. While some simply consists of collections of letters, known as tags, with little artistic value, such examples are easy to find, especially on larger spaces such as walls. If it weren't for the fact that most graffiti is placed on private property without permission, it might be more commonly recognized as a legal form of art. Most graffiti, however, annoys the property owner, who is more likely to paint over it or remove it than accept it as art. Many ways of removing graffiti have been developed, such as paints that dissolve graffiti paint, or make it easy to remove. Community groups and government departments often organize graffiti-removal teams. It hardly makes sense to encourage artists to deface private or public property; but perhaps there are ways to work with them rather than just oppose them. Graffiti artists can, for example, create murals for property owners, and get paid for them. Maybe we need to start at a very basic level, and find a way to encourage the creation of graffiti art on paper or canvas rather than on walls. After all, who would remember Monet or Picasso if they'd created their masterpieces on walls, only to have them painted over the next day? Finding a solution to such a complex problem is never going to be easy, but with more and more graffiti art being recognized in galleries around the world, we do need to try.

Doctors suggest that people should wash their hands _ .	A Healthy Habits Survey shows that only about one third of American seniors have correct habits. Here are some findings and expert advice. 1.How many times did you brush your teeth yesterday? *Finding:A full 33% of seniors brush their teeth only once a day. *Step:Remove the 300 types of bacteria in your mouth each morning with a battery-operated toothbrush. Brush gently for 2 minutes, at least twice a day. 2.How many times did you wash your hands or bathe yesterday? *Finding:Seniors, on average, bathe fewer than 3 days a week. And nearly 30%wash their hands only 4 times a day-half of the number doctors recommend. *Step:We touch our faces around 3,000 times a day-often inviting germs to enter our mouth, nose, and eyes.Use toilet paper to avoid touching the door handle. And, most important, wash your hands often with hot running water and soap for 20 seconds. 3. How often do you think about fighting germs? *Finding:Seniors are not fighting germs as well as they should. *Step:Be aware of germs. Do you know it is not your toilet but your kitchen sponge that can carry more germs than anything else? To kill these germs, keep your sponge in the microwave for 10 seconds.	['eight times a day']
The first try of the hibernation technology _ the six person Human Outer Planets Exploration Mission to Jupiter's moon Callisto.	"Have you ever dreamed of visiting a planet in the Milky Way? While the trip sounds exciting, it would take years and years to reach the place that we are going to. So in the future, bedtime for astronauts may be more than a few hours of regular shut-eye. They would have to sleep for years. European researchers are now doing hibernation experiments. The study may help them understand whether humans could ever sleep through the years it would take for a space flight to distant planets. ""If there was an effective technology, it could make deep-space travel come true,"" said Mark Ayer of the European Space Agency last month. What seems like science fiction is not completely impossible. Researchers have been able to use chemicals to put living cells into a sleep-like state where they don't age. They have now moved on to small, non-hibernating mammals like rats. The results will be out soon. A major challenge is the fact that cells can be very simple systems, but body organs are far more complex . ""It's like moving from a simple Apple computer to a supercomputer,"" said Marco Biggiogera, a hibernation researcher at Italy's University of Pavia. Just like bears and frogs, the hibernation of human beings would cause a person's metabolism to lower so they would need less energy. Medical research, however, is just half of a space flight hibernation system. There is the challenge of designing a suitable protective place to live. Such a place would provide the proper environment for hibernation, such as the proper temperature. It would also have to monitor life functions and serve the physiological needs of the hibernator. According to Ayer, the six-person Human Outer Planets Exploration Mission to Jupiter's moon Callisto, could be an opportunity to use human hibernation. The mission aims to send six humans on a five-year flight to Callisto, where they will spend 30 days, in 2045. , ."	['may be']
As far as we can tell from the story, Agatha Christie _ .	"Everybody may have seen the film ""Death on the Nile (n. )"", but nobody can imagine that the writer of the story, Agatha Christie, saved a baby in a most unusual way. In June 1977, a baby girl became seriously ill in Deleville. Doctors there were unable to find out the cause of her illness, so she was sent to a famous hospital in London, where there were many excellent doctors. The baby was so seriously ill that a team of doctors hurried to examine the baby without delay. The doctors, too, were puzzled by the baby's illness and they also became discouraged. Just then a nurse asked to speak to them. ""I think the baby is suffering from thallium (n. ) poisoning. "" said the nurse. ""A few days ago, I read a story 'A Pale Horse' written by Agatha Christie. Someone uses thallium poison, and all the symptoms are written in the book. They are exactly the same as the baby's."" ""You're very good at observing things,"" said a doctor, ""and you may be right. We'll carry out some tests and find out whether the cause is thallium poisoning or not."" The tests proved that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium. Once they knew the cause, the doctors were able to give her correct treatment. The baby soon got well and was sent back to Deleville A week later, it was reported that the poison might have come from an insecticide (n. ) used in Deleville."	['had never met this baby']

How many days is it from the day this article was made to the Lunar New Year?	"His eyes nearly in tears from the crush of fellow travelers at Guangzhou's train station, Hong Tao said things were much better on Sunday, after days of waiting for a train to his home in Hubei province. ""I think it's fine today, and everything is going smoothly,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I thought it would be really crowded but it has turned out to be OK."" Chinese authorities say they expect 1.3 million people to travel out of Guangzhou's train station over the next few days, as they rush to get home by Wednesday, the eve of Lunar New Year. Hong's optimism may have been helped by the blue skies that emerged over Guangzhou on Sunday for the first time in a week. Last week, a rare winter storm paralyzed China's transportation system as millions tried to get home to celebrate the holiday -- the only chance for many migrant workers to see their families all year. China's state-run Xinhua news agency said Friday that 95 percent of rail traffic had ""returned to normal."" But Guangzhou's train station remained packed with a backlog of hundreds of thousands of travelers hoping to get home for the holiday. A young woman was stepped on in a stampede at the train station Friday, and later died of her injuries, according to Xinhua. Video of the situation on Friday showed crowds of people screaming, elbowing each other, in some cases sobbing and collapsing in the rush to get a slot (,) on a train. China Sunday announced it has organized over 300,000 People's Liberation Army forces to southern China in what it described as a ""war on winter weather"". The government also announced a $700 million plan to help farmers whose crops have been destroyed."	['Five days.']
What instrument could Einstein play?	"Do you like to listen to music when you feel sad? Do you like to sing songs in the shower? Music is everywhere. But in many countries, music classes in schools are _ . These days, because of the bad economy in the US, some schools fired arts teachers including music teachers. Some students don't have the chance to learn music. In China, there are no exams for music. So many students choose to make use of their time and study subjects like science, math and history. But do you know that learning music helps children grow? ""Playing music is like doing different things all together"", said Gottfried Schlaug at Harvard Medical School. For example, when playing the piano, people see the music notes. And they decode them. At the same time, they use their fingers to make sounds. You do all these things at the same time. Scientists say that music helps with science too. Einstein played the violin. And German physicist Max Planck was talented in playing the piano. Music is also a very valuable thing. It makes you interested in things, and it makes you happy, according to US National Science Foundation."	['violin']
Now on Sweetest Day gifts are given to those _ .	"Sweetest Day in America is always the third Saturday in October. This holiday is much more important in some regions than in others (Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo being the biggest Sweetest Day cities). It is a holiday that is gaining in popularity every year throughout the country. Sweetest Day is celebrated on the third Saturday in October as a day to make someone happy. It is an occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to remember not only the sick, aged, and orphaned, but also friends, relatives and associates whose helpfulness and kindness we have enjoyed. Over 60 years ago, a man in Cleveland, believing that the city's orphans and shutins too often felt forgotten and neglected, thought of the idea of showing them that they were remembered. He did this through the distribution of small gifts. With the help of his friends and neighbors, he distributed these small remembrances on a Saturday in October. During the years that followed, other Clevelanders began to participate in the celebration ceremony, which came to be called ""Sweetest Day"". In time, the Sweetest Day idea of spreading cheer to the underprivileged was broadened to include everyone, and became an occasion for remembering others with a kind act or a small remembrance. And soon the idea spread to other cities all over the country. Sweetest Day is not based on any single group's religious affection or on a family relationship. It is a reminder that a thoughtful word or deed enriches life and gives it meaning. Because for many people remembering takes the form of giftgiving, Sweetest Day offers us the opportunity to show others that we care, in a practical way."	['we care']
What is Boyhood mainly about?	The 87thAcademy Award nominations were announced on Jan 15, and The Grand Budapest Hotel stood out as a favorite with nine nominations, including Best Picture. Check out some other Best Picture nominees to see if you missed any of last year's top Hollywood films. The Imitation Game This historical thriller is about British computer scientist, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), the father of artificial intelligence. At the start of World War II, Turing was asked to join a select team of mathematical geniuses to decode the system the Nazis used to send military messages. Besides the actual breaking of the code, Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing's personality, a mixture of decency and shyness, is also a highlight of the movie. Birdman This dark comedy film is about how Riggan Thomson, a faded star once famous for his superhero roles, struggles to regain fame. American actor Michael Keaton, 63, who has a similar experience to Thomson's, plays the leading role. Selma A stellar cast including talk show queen Oprah Winfrey may be one reason to see Selma. But that the film focuses on Martin Luther King Jr.'s struggle for civil rights also makes it worth viewing. Based on the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches, the film is a chronicle of King's (David Oyelowo) campaign for political rights for African-American people. The Theory of Everything We know English theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking for his significant scientific discoveries, especially his black hole theories. This biographical film reveals the scientist's (played by Eddie Redmayne) secret romantic relationship with Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whom he meets and falls in love with at Cambridge and who later becomes his first wife. Boyhood American Director Richard Linklater did an experiment in this film, using the same cast for 12 years to record a boy's growth. In two and a half hours, we see Mason, a Texas boy from a divorced family, grow from 6-year-old boy to a freshman in college.	['The growth of a young boy.']
The writer of this passage wants to _ .	"Passage 4 From the world's heaviest apple, the oldest lady to the world's smallest dog, these are all parts of a group of the world's strangest people and things. And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ). The book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world. People now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? ""It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world."" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport. The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it! The newest book came out last Tuesday. This book has a lot of interesting records. Here are two: A British dog, Whitney, is the world's smallest dog. It's only 76mm tall. An American woman Lee Redmond has the longest fingernails .They grew as long as 600 mm! She made the record in 1971."	['give us an introduction to the Guinness Book of Records']
Which statement is NOT true about Li Na?	China's first and only Grand Slam winner Li Na formally announced her retirement on Friday, leaving the Chinese tennis yearning for the next superstar. Following is part of her farewell and retirement letter: For close to fifteen years, we've been a part of each other's lives. As a tennis player representing China on the global stage, I've trekked around the world playing hundreds of matches on the WTA tour, for China's Fed Cup team, at the National Games and at several Olympic Games. You've always been there for me, supporting me, cheering me on, and encouraging me to reach my potential. Representing China on the tennis court was an extraordinary privilege and a true honor. Having the unique opportunity to effectively bring more attention to the sport of tennis in China and all over Asia is something I will cherish forever. But in sport, just like in life, all great things must come to an end.2014 has become one of the most significant years in my career and my life. This year was full of amazing highlights, which included winning my second Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open and sharing the extraordinary experience with my country, my team, my husband and my fans. It was also a year filled with difficult moments, such as having to deal with the inevitable - making the decision to end my professional tennis career. The amazing moment in Australia was filled with joy, happiness and extraordinary sense of accomplishment. It took me several agonizing months to finally come to the decision that my chronic injuries will never again let me be the tennis player that I can be. Most people in the tennis world know that my career has been marked by my troubled right knee. The black brace I wear over it when I step on the court has become my tennis birth mark. After four knee surgeries and hundreds of shots injected into my knee weekly to ease swelling and pain, my body is begging me to stop the pounding. My previous three surgeries were on my right knee. My most recent knee surgery took place this July and was on my left knee. After a few weeks of post-surgery recovery, I tried to go through all the necessary steps to get back on the court. One of my goals was to recover as fast as I could in order to be ready for the first WTA tournament in my hometown of Wuhan. As hard as I tried to get back to being 100%, my body kept telling me that, at 32, I will not be able to compete at the top level ever again.

What do you guess the author will go on writing? _	"Noah felt like he was always hitting the books. While his friends were meeting for pickup soccer games after school, he was back home in his room reading and rereading the same material. But no matter how hard Noah studied, he had difficulty remembering things and his grades stayed average. Meanwhile, his friend Sean, who never seemed to study, always aced tests. It didn't seem fair. Because Noah was so frustrated , his dad and teachers made an appointment with the school psychologist. She diagnosed Noah with a learning disability. Although Noah felt relieved to know what was going on, he was also worried. He didn't like the ""disability"" label. And he was concerned about what it might mean for his future. Would he be able to go to college and study engineering as he'd hoped? For someone diagnosed with a learning disability, it can seem scary at first. But a learning disability doesn't have anything to do with a person's intelligence. After all, such successful people as Walt Disney, Alexander Graham Bell, and Winston Churchill all had learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are problems that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, analyze, or store information. These problems can make it difficult for a student to learn as quickly as someone who isn't affected by learning disabilities. The way our brains process information is extremely complex --- it's no wonder things can get messed up sometimes. Take the simple act of looking at a picture, for example: Our brains not only have to form the lines into an image, they also have to recognize what the image stands for, relate that image to other facts stored in our memories, and then store this new information. It's the same thing with speech - we have to recognize the words, interpret the meaning, and figure out the significance of the statement to us. Many of these activities take place in separate parts of the brain, and it's up to our minds to link them all together. If, like Noah, you've been diagnosed with a learning disability, you're not alone. Nearly four million school-age children and teens have learning disabilities, and at least 20% of them have a type of disorder that makes it difficult to focus. No one's exactly sure what causes learning disabilities. But researchers do have some theories as to why they develop."	['What causes learning disabilities.']
What do the scientists find in their research?	Most people regard zoos as safe places for animals, where struggles such as difficulty finding food and avoiding predators don't exist. Without such problems, animals in zoos should live to a ripe old age. But that may not be true for the largest land animals on Earth. Scientists have known that elephants in zoos often develop diseases, joint problems and behavior changes. Sometimes, they even become unable to have babies. To learn more about how captivity affects elephants, a team of international scientists led by Mason, a biologist, compared the life spans of female elephants born in zoos with female elephants living outdoors in the wild. Zoos keep detailed records of all the animals in their care, documenting factors such as birth dates, illnesses, weight and death. These records made it possible for the researchers to analyze 40 years of data on 800 elephants in zoos. The team found that female elephants born in zoos lived an average of 16.9 years. Their wild counterparts who died of natural causes lived an average of 56 years----more than three times as long. Scientists don't yet know for sure why wild elephants seem to live so much better than their zoo-raised counterparts. Mason thinks stress and obesity may be to blame. Zoo elephants don't get the same kind of exercise as they do in the wild, and most are very fat. Elephant social lives are also much different in zoos than in the wild, where they live in large groups. Another finding from the study showed that elephants born in zoos were more likely to die earlier than elephants captured in the wild and brought to zoos. Mason suggests stress in the mothers in zoos might cause them to have babies that are less likely to survive. The study raises some questions about acquiring more elephants to keep in zoos. While some threatened and endangered species living in zoos reproduce successfully and keep healthy populations, that doesn't appear to be the case with elephants.	['Female zoo elephants die earlier than their wild counterparts.']
What was the most important thing to Sparky according to the passage?	"This is a story about a boy called Sparky. For Sparky, school was all but impossible. He failed every subject in the eighth grade. He got a zero in physics. It made him the worst physics student in the school's history. He didn't do much better in sports. Although he tried to join the school's golf team, he quickly lost the only important match. He didn't have friends, either. Other kids didn't care about him. If a classmate said ""Hello"" to Sparky outside of school, he would feel very surprised. Sparky was a loser and everyone knew it. So he accepted it. But one thing was important to Sparky---drawing. He was proud of his artwork. In senior high school, he sent some cartoons to the editors of the yearbook but he was refused. Sparky was hurt. But he didn't lose hope because he believed in his ability and he _ . He decided to become a professional artist. He wrote a letter to the Walt Disney Studios after graduating from high school. The studio asked him to draw some cartoons on a certain subject. Sparky spent a lot of time on the cartoons. Finally, the reply came from Disney Studios: they aren't like cartoons. Was it time to stop drawing? Sparky didn't think so. He started to put his own life in the cartoons. He created his childhood self----a little boy loser: Charlie Brown. He wasn't good at football.But Charlie Brown would soon become famous worldwide. Sparky, the boy who used to fail in school and who was refused again and again, was Charles Schulz. He created the Peanuts comic strip and the world-famous cartoon characters Charlie Brown and Snoopy."	['Drawing']
People believing in freedom are those who _ .	"Freedom and Responsibility Freedom's challenge in the Digital Age is a serious topic. We are facing today a strange new world and we are all wondering what we are going to do with it. Some 2,500 years ago Greece discovered freedom. Before that there was no freedom. There were great civilizations, splendid empires, but no freedom anywhere. Egypt and Babylon were both _ , one very powerful man ruling over helpless masses. In Greece, in Athens , a little city in a little country, there were no helpless masses. And Athenians willingly obeyed the written laws which they themselves passed, and the unwritten, which must be obeyed if free men live together. They must show each other kindness and pity and the many qualities without which life would be very painful unless one chose to live alone in the desert.The Athenians never thought that a man was free if he could do what he wanted. A man was free if he was self-controlled. To make yourself obey what you approved was freedom. They were saved from looking at their lives as their own private affair. Each one felt responsible for the welfare of Athens, not because it was forced on him from the outside, but because the city was his pride and his safety. The essential belief of the first free government in the world was liberty for all men who could control themselves and would take responsibility for the state. But discovering freedom is not like discovering computers. It cannot be discovered once for all. If people do not prize it, and work for it, it will go. Constant watch is its price. Athens changed. It was a change that took place without being noticed though it was of the extreme importance, a spiritual change which affected the whole state. It had been the Athenian' s pride and joy to give to their city. That they could get material benefits from her never entered their minds. There had to be a complete change of attitude before they could look at the city as an employer who paid her citizens for doing her work. Now instead of men giving to the state, the state was to give to them. What the people wanted was a government which would provide a comfortable life for them; and with this as the primary object, ideas of freedom and self-reliance and responsibility were neglected to the point of disappearing. Athens was more and more looked on as a cooperative business possessed of great wealth in which all citizens had a right to share. Athens reached the point when the freedom she really wanted was freedom from responsibility. There could be only one result. If men insisted on being free from the burden of self-dependence and responsibility for the common good, they would cease to be free. Responsibility is the price every man must pay for freedom. It is to be had on no other terms. Athens, the Athens of Ancient Greece, refused responsibility; she reached the end of freedom and was never to have it again. But, ""the excellent becomes the permanent"", Aristotle said. Athens lost freedom forever, but freedom was not lost forever for the world. A great American, James Madison, referred to: ""The capacity of mankind for self-government."" No doubt he had not an idea that he was speaking Greek. Athens was not in the farthest background of his mind, but once man has a great and good idea, it is never completely lost. The Digital Age cannot destroy it. Somehow in this or that man's thought such an idea lives though unconsidered by the world of action. One can never be sure that it is not on the point of breaking out into action only sure that it will do so sometime."	['behave within the laws and value systems']
From the passage, we can infer that _ .	"While waiting to pick up a friend at the airport in Portland, Oregon, I had an experience which occurred merely two feet away from me. Trying to locate my friend among the passengers coming through the jet way, I noticed a man walking toward me carrying two light bags. He stopped right next to me to greet his family. First he kissed his three children one by one and said, ""It's nice to see you. I missed you so much!"" Then he hugged his wife, ""I've saved the best for last!"" giving her the longest, most passionate kiss I ever remember seeing. They stared at each other's eyes, smiling at one another, while holding both hands. For an instant they reminded me of newlyweds , but I knew by the age of their kids that they couldn't possibly be. Full of admiration, I asked, ""Wow! How long have you two been married?"" ""Being together for fourteen years total, married twelve of those."" He replied, without breaking his gaze from his lovely wife's face. ""Well, then, how long have you been away?"" I asked. ""Two whole days!"" ""Two days?"" I was astonished. By the intensity of the greeting, I had assumed he'd been gone for at least several weeks --- if not months. I knew _ so I turned away my eyes and said quietly, ""I hope my marriage is still that passionate after so long!"" The man suddenly stopped smiling and looked me straight in the eye. With forcefulness he told me something that left me a different person. ""Don't hope, friend...decide!"" Then he smiled again, shook my hand and said, ""God bless!"" With that, he and his family turned and walked away together. I was still watching that man and his special family walk just out of sight when my friend came up to me and asked, ""What are you looking at?"" Without hesitation, and with a curious sense of certainty, I replied, ""My future!"""	['the author will live a passionate life from now on']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"Because plants cannot move or talk, most people believe that they have no feelings and that they cannot receive signals from outside. However, this may not be completely true. People who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge . It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called ""galvanometer"". The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened. A man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them - perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot - then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects . Backster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room. Another scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster's. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain. In fact, Sauvin could cause a change in the electrical field of his plants over a distance of a few miles simply by thinking about them."

It is inferred that more tests need to be done because _ .	A new study says one part of the human brain may become smaller as the result of a condition known as jet lag. Jet lag results from flying long distances in an airplane. Jet lag interferes with a person's normal times for sleeping and waking. People with jet lag may feel extremely tired for several days. They also may have problems thinking clearly and remembering. Kwangwook Cho is a researcher at the University of Bristol in Britain. He reported the findings of his jet lag study in the publication Nature Neuroscience. The study involved twenty young women who worked for international airlines. The women had served passengers on airplanes for five years. These flight attendants flew across many countries and at least seven time zones. In the study, the flight attendants had different amounts of time to recover from jet lag. Half the women spent five days or fewer in their home areas between long flights. The other half spent more than fourteen days in their home areas. Mister Cho took some fluid from the women's mouths to measure levels of a hormone that increases during stress. He tested them to see if they could remember where black spots appeared on a computer screen. And he took pictures of their brains using magnetic resonance imaging. This is a way to measure the size of the brain's temporal lobes. It was found that the women who had less time between flights had smaller right temporal lobes. This area of the brain deals with recognizing and remembering what is seen. The same group performed worse and had slower reaction times on the visual memory test. And their saliva samples showed higher levels of stress hormones. Mister Cho says he believes the brain needs at least ten days to recover after a long trip. He says airline workers told him their ability to remember got worse after working on planes for about four years. Other studies have shown that increased feelings of stress can cause a loss of cells in the part of the brain that controls memory. Scientists say more tests are needed to study the effects of jet lag on the brain. They want to find out if too much jet lag could permanently affect memory.

Why is O'Keeffe considered an artistic pioneer ?	The painter Georgia O'keeffe was born in Wisconsin in 1887 and grew up on her family's farm. At seventeen she decided she wanted to be an artist and left the farm for schools in Chicago and New York, but she never lost her bond with the land. Like most painters, O'Keeffe painted the things that were most important to her, and nearly all her works are simplified portrayals of nature. O'Keeffe became famous when her paintings were discovered and exhibited in New York by the photographer Levered Stieglitz, whom she married in 1924. During a visit to New York in 1929, O'Keeffe was so moved by the bleak landscape and broad skies of the Western desert that she began to paint its images. Cows' skulls and other bleached bones found in the desert figured prominently in her paintings. When her husband died in 1946, she moved to New Mexico permanently and used the horizon lines of the desert, colorful flowers, rocks, barren hills, and the sky as subjects for her paintings. Although O'Keeffe painted her best known works in the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's, she continued to produce tributes(, ) to the Western desert until her death in 1986. O'Keeffe is widely considered to have been a pioneering American modernist painter. While most early modern American artists were strongly influenced by European art, O'Keeffe's position was more independent. She established her own vision and preferred to view her painting as a private endeavor. Almost from the beginning, her work was more indentifiably American than that of her contemporaries in its simplified and idealized treatment of color, light, space, and natural forms.

Which of the following is NOT done by satellites according to the passage?	Satellites are an important part of our ordinary lives.For example, the information for weather forecasts is sent by satellite.Some satellites have cameras which take photographs of the Earth to show how clouds are moving.Satellites are also used to connect our international phone calls. Computer connections of the World Wide Web and Internet also use satellites. Many of our TV programs come to US through satellites.Airplane pilots also sometimes use a satellite to help them find their exact location. We use satellites to send television pictures from one part of the world to another.They are usually 35,880 kilometers above the equator.Sometimes we can see a satellite in the sky and it seems to stay in the same place. _ is because it is moving around the world at 11,000 kilometers an hour--exactly the same speed that the earth rotates.A satellite must orbit the Earth with its antennae facing the earth.Sometimes, it moves away from its orbit ,So there are little rockets on it which are used to put the satellite back in the right position.This usually happens about every five or six days. Space is not empty! Every week, more and more satellites are sent into space to orbit the Earth.A satellite usually works for about 10-12 years.Satellites which are broken are sometimes repaired by astronauts or sometimes brought back to Earth to be repaired.Often,very old or broken satellites are left in space to orbit the Earth for a very long time.This is very serious because some satellites use nuclear power and they can crash into each other.

Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the passage?	"Woman Uses Daughter's Key to ""Steal"" Car Charlie Vansant, a college student of Athens, Ohio, who reported that his car was stolen, got a surprise when he learned that a woman had mistaken it for her daughter's car and driven it home--using her key. Kate Anderson became an accidental ""car thief"" when picking up her daughter's car near an Ohio University building last week. Anderson found the Toyota Camry and used her daughter's car key to unlock the car, start the engine and drove it home--without realizing that the car didn't belong to her daughter. When Charlie Vansant left class a short time later, he found only an empty parking spot. He first assumed the car had been towed , but when the police couldn't find a record of it, then they took a theft report. That morning, after Anderson drove the car home, her daughter discovered the Camry in the driveway wasn't hers. Anderson said she was able to find Vansant's name on the paperwork in the glove compartment and look up his phone number on the website for the university. When Anderson told Charlie the car was in her driveway, ""It sounded really suspicious at first, as if she wanted to hold the thing for ransom ,"" said Vansant. He eventually went to the house with a police officer, where he was reunited with his car. According to the police report, the case was closed ""because of mistaken car identity"", and Anderson wasn't charged. Vansant blamed the car company more than the ""thief"". ""Her key fit not only my lock, but my ignition as well--so high-five for Toyota, I guess,"" he said. (307 words)"	"[""Mrs. Anderson stole Charlie's car at the request of her daughter.""]"

The author writes the passage mainly to _ .	Situated in the Northeast region of Vietnam, Halong Bay is made up of 1,969 islands of various sizes, 989 of which have been given names. The concentrated zone of stone islands is famous for its spectacular scenery of caves, and forms the central zone of Halong Bay. Seen from above, Halong Bay looks like a geographic work of art. While exploring the bay, you feel lost in a wonderful world. There is Man's Head Island, which resembles a man standing and looking towards the mainland. Dragon Island looks like a dragon winding above the blue water. La Vong Island resembles an old man fishing. There are also the islands of the Sail, the Pair of Roosters, and the Incense Burner, which are all astonishingly like their names. It has been proven by scientists that Halong Bay was one of the first places of human existence. It is also a region of highly-concentrated biological diversity with many ecosystems of coral reefs, and tropical forests, which are home to thousands of species of animals and rare plants. The beach located along the coast of Halong Bay has a year-round average temperature of 20degC. Among the palm trees are large hotels. Visitors are seen on white sand and under the green trees are small family-run restaurants. After swimming, tourists can enjoy cold drinks. No wonder the 18h meeting of the Committee of the World Heritages of UNESCO officially recognized Halong Bay as a natural heritage site of worldwide importance.

What can be a suitable title for the text?	"Children at school need this type of memory on a daily basis for a variety of tasks, such as following teachers' instructions or remembering oral sentences. During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one of two simple tasks during which researchers checked to ask if the participants' minds were wandering. At the end, participants measured their working memory ability by remembering a series of letters with simple maths questions. Daniel, a psychologist in the United States, said that those with higher working memory ability reported ""more mind wandering during these simple tasks"", but their performance did not suffer. The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm previous research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple thoughts at the same time. Dr Smallwood,in Leipzig,Germany,said: ""What this study seems to suggest is that, when circumstances for the task aren't very difficult, people who have additional working memory resources arrange _ to think about things other than what they're doing. "" Working memory ability is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores, and also offers a window into the widespread, but not well understood, field of internally driven thoughts. Dr Smallwood added: ""Our results suggest the sorts of planning that people do quite often in daily life--when they are on the bus, when they are cycling to work, when they are in the shower--are probably supported by working memory."

Which of the following one can be the best title of the passage?	"Flight Distance Any observant people have noticed that a wild animal will allow a man or other potential enemy to approach only up to a given distance before it escapes. ""Flight distance"" is the terms used for this interspecies spacing. As a general rule, there is a positive relationship between the size of an animal and its flight distance --- the larger the animal, the greater the distance it must keep between itself and the enemy. An antelope will escape when the enemy is as much as five hundred yards away. The wall lizard's flight distance, on the other hand, is about six feet. Flight is the basic means of survival for mobile creatures. Critical Distance Critical distance apparently is present wherever and whenever there is a flight reaction. ""Critical distance"" includes the narrow zone separating flight distance from attack distance. A lion in a zoo will flee from an approaching man until it meets a barrier that it cannot overcome. If the man continues the approach, he soon penetrates(,)the lion's critical distance, at which point the cornered lion turns back and begins slowly stalk the man. Social Distance Social animals need to stay in touch with each other. Loss of contact with the group can be fatal for a variety of reasons including exposure to enemies. Social distance is not simply the distance at which an animal will lose contact with his group --- that is, the distance at which it can no longer see, hear, or smell the group --- it is rather a psychological distance, one at which the animal apparently begins to feel anxious when it goes beyond its limits. We can think of it as a hidden band that contains the group. Social distance varies from species to species. It is quite short --- apparently only a few yards --- among some animals, and quite long among others. Social distance is not always rigidly fixed but is determined in part by the situation. When the young of apes and humans are mobile but not yet under control of the mother's voice, social distance may be the length of her reach. This is readily observed among baboons in a zoo. When the baby approaches a certain point, the mother reaches out to seize the end of its tail and pull it back to her. When added control is needed because of danger, social distance shortens. To show this in man, one has only to watch a family with a number of small children holding hands as they cross a busy street."	['Spacing in Animals']
According to the passage, why haven't Masai tribesmen killed many lions since 2003?	"At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. ""We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community."" He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, ""The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them."" They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here."	['Because the fund will pay for dead animals killed by lions']
The best tide of this passage may be _ .	"Cities could soon be looking after their citizens all by themselves thanks to an operating system(OS) designed for the metropolis. The Urban OS works just like a PC operating system but keeps buildings 9 traffic and services running smoothly. The software takes in data from sensors dotted around the city to keep an eye on what is happening. In the event of a fire the Urban OS might manage traffic lights so fire engines can reach the blaze swiftly. The idea is for the Urban OS to gather data from sensors buried in buildings and many other places to keep an eye on what is happening in an urban area. The sensors monitor everything from large scale events such as traffic flows across the entire city down to more local phenomena such as temperature sensors inside individual rooms. The OS completely bypasses humans to manage communication between sensors and devices such as traffic lights, air conditioning or water pumps that influence the quality of city life. Channeling all the data coming from these sensors and services into a over-arching control system had lots of benefits, said Steve Lewis, head of Living Plan FT-the company behind Urban OS.The system can help with monitoring patients at hospitals. Urban OS should mean buildings get managed better and gathering the data from lots of sources gives a broader view of key city services such as traffic flows, energy use and water levels. "" If you were using an anatomy analogy, the city has a network like the nervous system, talking to a whole bunch of sensors gathering the data and causing actions,"" said Mr.Lewis. "" We distribute that nervous system into the parts of the body--the buildings, the streets and other things. Having one platform managing the entire urban landscape of a city means significant cost savings, implementation consistency, quality and manageability, he added. ""And it' s got local computing capacity to allow a building or an automotive platform to interact with people where they are, managing the energy, water, waste, transportation, logistics and human interaction in those areas."" That' s dealt with by the building itself, with the devices very locally talking to each other to figure out what' s the best solution for the current dilemma."

Why don't some children like to wear GPS-enabled walking shoes ?	There is good news for old people with Alzheimer's disease . As we know, people who have Alzheimer's disease may get lost easily. Sometimes they can't find the way to their home. All the family members must be worried about their safety. Now, some has invented GPS-enabled walking shoes. The shoes are very special and useful. They can help people find old people easily, wherever they go. These walking shoes are especially important for people who are in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. According to the research, such old people have the highest danger. Let's see some terrible facts. About 60c/o of patients with Alzheimer's disease get lost for days when they go for a walk. Up to half of those who are lost and not found within 24 hours can die outside. If old people wear such shoes , you needn't worry about that. These shoes can help their families to find _ easily if they are lost. So you see, the shoes can ensure old people's safety. These walking shoes are equipped with a GPS device in the heel. The shoes are very comfortable and they look like the shoes that many old people wear. The GPS-enabled walking shoes have a great advantage. Of course, the shoes are suitable for children .Parents can ask them to wear such shoes. Then they can find their children easily. But some children have different ideas. Sometimes, they don't want their parents to know where they are. What will they do? Well... some children say that they will take them off and put them at home.

According to the writer, students in New York City's public schools will _ .	"Carmen Arace Middle School is situated in the pastoral town of Bloomfield, Conn., but four years ago it faced many of the same problems as inner-city schools in nearby Hartford: low scores on standardized tests and dropping enrollment . Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million. Now, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%. Indeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example. Governor Angus King had planned using $50 million to buy a laptop for all of Maine's 17,000 seventh-graders - and for new seventh-graders each fall. In the same spirit, the New York City board of education voted on April 12 to create a school Internet portal , which would make money by selling ads and licensing public school students. Profits will also provide e-mail service for the city's 1.1 million public school students. Profits will be used to buy laptops for each of the school system's 87,000 fourth-graders. Within nine years, all students in grades 4 and higher will have their own computers. Back in Bloomfield, in the meantime, most of the _ have been worked out. Some students were using their computers to visit unauthorized websites. But teachers have the ability to keep an eye on where students have been on the Web and to stop them. ""That is the worst when they disable you,"" says eighth-grade honors student Jamie Bassell. The habit is rubbing off on parents. ""I taught my mom to use e-mail,"" says another eighth-grader, Katherine Hypolite. ""And now she's taking computer classes. I'm so proud of her!"""	['enjoy e-mail service in the near future']
A true winner _ .	It seems that the key to winning any contest is in the belief that you can win. This belief is what inspires one to do one's best. If we have this belief, we work tirelessly to accomplish our goals, and make whatever sacrifices which are necessary. Whether it's a hot-dog eating contest or a spelling bee, the winners have not just been the ones with the most skills, but those with the greatest desire to win. Much can be said for positive thinking. An entire movement is based on the idea that if you visualize your goals on a daily basis, you will accomplish them, no matter how difficult they may seem. Most life coaches recommend writing down a list of all of your goals on a poster, and then displaying it where you'll see it every day. This way these goals will become so much a part of your life that you will find yourself driven to accomplish every one of them. The same strategy applies to winning any contest. Practice is, of course, also part of winning. If you're not devoted enough to practice, then you have no hope anyway. Don't take the other contestants for granted. They're working just as hard as you are, and you have to keep practicing all the way up to the moment of competition if you really want to win. Finally, show grace in victory. Always be generous in your praise of the other contestants. The positive energy of their good will toward you will carry you to countless additional victories. Be proud in you heart that you worked so hard to accomplish your goals, and that you deserve the reward you've just gotten, but accept the reward with a modest and gracious manner.

The RSPB believes that it's valuable for children to _ .	"Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) suggests. The three-year project found that only 21 % of children aged 8 --12 were ""connected to nature"". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what ""connected to nature"" actually means and then deve -loped a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1, 200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21 % of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This ""realistic and achievable"" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organization. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27 % of girls were at or above the ""realistic and achievable"" target, only 16 % of boys were at the same level. ""We need to understand these differences,"" Sue Armstrong Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC New. ""Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyze the data to find that out."" The report also stressed significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland."	['be exposed to the natural world']
If a state agrees to accept the national standards, it will probably get _ .	Americans are thinking about national education standards recently developed by teachers and other education experts. The National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) led the effort. The United States, unlike other nations, has never had the same school standards across the country. What is the reason? Education is not discussed in the Constitution. That document limits the responsibilities of the federal government. Other responsibilities, like education, fall to each state. Local control of education probably was a good idea two hundred years ago. People stayed in the same place and schools knew what students needed to learn. But today, people move to different cities. And some people work at jobs that did not exist even twenty years ago. Many American educators say that getting a good education should not depend on where you live. They say that some states have lowered their standards in order to increase student scores on tests required by the No Child Left behind Act. Kara Schlosser is communications director for the CCSSO. She says the new standards clearly state what a student should be able to do to be successful in college and work. Forty--eight states have already shown approval for the standards. Two states refuse to accept the idea. Critics say that working toward the same standards in every state will not guarantee excellence for all. Some educators in Massachusetts say adopting the national standards will hurt their students because the state standards are even higher. Others say the change will be too costly, requiring new textbooks and different kinds of training for teachers. Still others fear federal control. Supporters say the standards are goals and do not tell states or teachers how to teach. They also say the federal government is not forcing acceptance. However, approving the standards will help states qualify for some federal grant money.	['money from the federal government']
"Products connected to the film ""Cinderella"" are generally aimed at _ ."	"Years ago, the American writer Kurt Vonnegut often said there was one story that would always make a million dollars: Cinderella. In Hollywood and in today's economy, it is more like $70 million and that is just a start. ""Cinderella"" made that amount in ticket sales when it opened last weekend. But the merchandising deals linked to the movie are also hugely valuable. So the artistic success of the film is open to debate. What is clear, however, is the movie's business success. It is a hit in the theaters but it is also a hit in retail . And Disney widened its usual market for ""Cinderella"" products. There are products connected to the Disney film targeted not only at little girls, but women, too. For example, the famous shoe designer Jimmy Choo partnered with Disney to create a version of Cinderella's ""glass slippers"" or shoes. You can buy them for about $5,000. At that price, you would not want to lose one at the ball, even if that is the way you get your prince. Several other shoemakers also accepted Disney deals to design versions of the famous footwear. The makeup company MAC quickly sold all its products with official links to ""Cinderella."" But lucky buyers were soon selling the products on the online marketplace eBay for many times the original price.

Which of the following is TRUE?	"India has a population of 1.27 billion. Its population is the second largest in the world. China has the largest population of over 1.36 billion. One out of six people on this planet live in India. Although, the crown of the world's most populous country is on China's head for ten years. India will take the _ by 2030. With the population growth rate at 1.58%, India will have more than 1.53 billion people by the end of 2030. Now more than 50% of India's population is below the age of 25 and over 65% below the age of 35. About 72.2% of the population lives in some 638,000 villages. Some of the reasons for India's quickly growing population are poverty, illiteracy , decrease in death rates and immigration from Bangladesh and Nepal. India started taking measures to stop the growth rate quite early. India had the ""National Family Planning Program"" in 1952. It became the first country in the world to have a population policy. However, it failed to reach the final goal ."	['One out of seven people on the earth live in India.']
Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?	One day, a man who liked baked beans very much met a girl and fell in love with her. In order to avoid breaking wind in front of his newly-married wife, he gave up baked beans. They were married shortly thereafter. Months later, he smelled baked beans in a cafe on his way home. They were the best beans he had ever smelled! He could not resist and had three large orders of baked beans. All the way home he had gas. His wife seemed excited and a bit mysterious to see him. She _ him and led him to his chair at the dinning room table. Just as she was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. Seizing the chance of her absence, he shifting his weight to one leg and let the gas go. He took the napkin from his lap and fanned the air about him. When he felt another wind coming on, he shifted his weight to the other leg and let it go again. Then he made a third fart. Yet somehow his wife didn't hear him. While keeping his ear on the phone conversation in the hall, he again fanned with force until he heard his wife saying goodbye on the phone, meaning the end of his freedom. Apologizing for taking so long a time, she asked if he had peeked . He assured her that he had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold and there was his surprise---- Twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party!	['A surprise on Birthday Party']

What's the passage mainly about?	"Ask anyone what is the most difficult part of changing their lifestyle habits and they are most likely to say, ""Staying motivated."" But a 36-year-old professor from Carnegie Mellon University claims it may have the answer in the form of robot weight loss coach that dishes out daily health advice and encouragement. Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots. The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them. Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character. In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log. ""While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,"" he said. The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen. Autom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around $500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed."

Why is Angela Merkel willing to take in refugees according to the passage?	"I love seeing Europeans line up in airports to applaud arriving refugees. But humanitarianism will not guide policy for long. We liberals need to argue from Europe's self-interest: our continent has the need, the space and the ability to accept people. Many European countries are gradually turning into old people's homes. Germany, Italy, Spain and others have some of the lowest birth rates in human history. It is predicted that about one-third of their populations will be aged over 65 in 2050. Germany needs to import at least 350,000 people a year to keep its workforce stable. Suddenly, young ambitious workers are pouring into the country as if called by a genie with a lamp. No wonder Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, has been more welcoming than David Cameron, British Prime Minister. But all over Europe, carers for old people are already in need. Norway found oil under the seabed but it would have been better off if it had discovered 50,000 nurses there instead. Many rightwingers think we have reached our limits. This feeling is widespread. And it's true that Western Europe is one of the most densely populated regions on earth. Indeed, density has long been Europe's unique selling point: with so many people of different nations closely packed together, we have always traded goods and exchanged ideas fast. That's why the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries happened here. But we have plenty more room. Many European cities aren't dense enough. Now east Germany, north-western Spain and gorgeous mountain villages in Italy are losing people. Lots of cities have unused industrial land. Humans inhabit a slice of the EU's territory. Only about 2.5 per cent of the EU's land is used for housing, estimates the European Commission. By contrast, a whopping 43 per cent was used for agriculture in 2009, it says. That's too much. We could turn more land into forest or into green landscapes where people can relax and play. Making that transition is feasible because we now use agricultural land inefficiently. Migrants often spend years locked up together in serious government-funded ""migrant centers"". However, the way to learn a new country's language, make friends and find work is to live with a local. This crisis has shown that lots of Europeans are willing to take refugees into their homes. After Iceland's government said it could take only 50 Syrian refugees, many Icelanders came forward offering to take a far greater number into their own homes. People aren't just sitting around waiting for government to do something. We need migrants, and we can accommodate them. If opponents just don't like foreigners, they should say so instead of pretending to be hardheaded pragmatists ."	['Refugees can make up the shortage of labor in Germany.']
From the passage we know that_.	"On the whole, it's not something we parents shout about, but one in four of us does it.Hiring private tutors for our children is now widespread.And this year, as always,the Easter holidays will be peak time for tutor demand. ""My husband and I tried to tutor her at home,but we found all our knowledge was out of date and we were only confusing Zarreen.We also tried a group revision course but all the children were sitting exams for different boards . On the whole we think one-two-one tuition works best and it is worth the money.In our case,Preeta is a bit like an elder sister to Zarreen and that's the most important,""says Ashan Sabri from London, whose daughter Zarreen,18,is having tuition in biology and chemistry in preparation for A-levels this summer. In fact,Preeta Datta is only six years older than her pupil and she is happy to provide extra tuition through mobile phone.""Maybe Zarreen will call me two or three times a week with a question about biology or chemistry, and that's fine to me,""says Datta. The real question is:does tutoring do any good? ""It's not the magic bullet,""says Professor Judith Ireson.'It's still up to the child to do the learning.If he or she isn't interested,then sending them to a private tutor won't do any good."" In which case,surely it's time to break open the Champagne ?Not necessarily, says Elaine Tyrrell,head of the Rowans School. ""While we recommend private tutoring for a few children whose first language isn't English,we don't encourage it for the others,""says Tyrrell.""With the level of education they get here,children really ought to be able to pass the entrance exams without any extra teaching. Besides, our biggest worry is that they might just get in with the help of last-minute tutoring,but,once they actually get to that school,they won't be able to manage."" It's a point worth considering.After all,who would want their child to stay at the bottom of the class?"	['Preeta Datta is only twenty four years old.']
What do we learn from the text?	Decisions, decisions! Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is central to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help? Most of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind. Consider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they're a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional center is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasio, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains, and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasio thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choices, which we use to help the present decision making. However, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking. All emotions affect our thinking and motivation , so it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence. Yet strangely there's one emotion that seems to help us make good choices. The American researchers found that sad people took time to consider the various choices on offer, and ended up making the best choices. In fact many studies show that people who feel unhappy have the most reasonable view of the world.	['Emotions are a part of decision making.']

What is the real meaning of the doctor's words?	"The most common disease in the world is the cold. It often starts with a sore throat . You sneeze and your nose runs. You usually have a headache, too. Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious disease, but you can feel quite bad. There isn't a cure for a cold, but you can take some medicine to make you feel better. For example, you can take aspirin to get rid of your headache. It is good to rest. and to drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me.""With the right medicine. a cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a whole week!"" A long time ago, people understood that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons makes a sore throat feel better. In modern times, scientists have found out which chemicals are in them. Man, of our medicines today are made from those chemicals. There are some diseases that we can't cure yet. And nobody has found a cure for old age. But because of modern medicines, the average people now live longer than their grandparents."	['There is almost no medicine that can cure the cold.']
What is this passage mainly about?	"If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble. Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding important organs like the heart liver could be as dangerous as the external fat which can be noticed more easily. ""Being thin doesn't surely mean you are not tat, said Dr Jimmy Bell at Imperial College. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create ""fat maps"" showing where people store fat. According to the result, people who keep their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are slim. Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside.Of the women, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had too high levels of internal fat.Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are actually on the edge of being fat.They eat too many fatty and sugary foods, but they are not eating enough to be fat.Scientists believe we naturally store fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere. Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some think it has something to do with heart disease and diabetes .They want to prove that internal fat damages the body's communication systems. The good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet.""If you want to be healthy, there is no shortcut.Exercise has to be an important part of your lifestyle, "" Bell said."	['Thin people may be fat inside.']
By doing mouse experiments, the scientists _ .	It is your sense of smell that quickly tells you there is good food in the kitchen, or your smelly socks need to be washed. But how do we recognize smell? Particular smells turn on certain groups of brain cells , scientists say. When your nose catches a slight smell of something, one of 1,000 different types of odor-receiving cells pick it up. These cells send an electrical signal to a special part of the brain. A group of scientists studied mouse brains using some particular odors like vanilla, apples and fish. They looked at thin slices of each mouse's brain to see which brain cells had been turned on by each odor. The scientists discovered that each odor produces a similar pattern of active cells in different mice. So, a certain combination of cells can tell a mouse that it is smelling vanilla, apples, fish, or any one of the thousands of other smells. Scientists could use studies like this to create a map. It could show which parts of the brain are activated by different smells. Some other scientists, however, say that researchers should also study animals that do not live in a lab, which have spent their lives smelling things in the natural world. With more smelling experience, they might show quite different patterns.	['found each smell creates a similar pattern of active cells in different mice']
Why did Mary Cassatt's family move to Europe when she was seven years old?	"Mary Cassatt was born in Pennsylvania in 1844. When she was seven, her family moved to Europe. They wanted their children to understand European ways and the people who lived there. They travelled a lot and she had visited many countries by the time she was 10 years old. After four years they returned to America. In those days, women didn't have professions, and there were very few women artists. Her family did not approve when she decided that she would become an artist. She studied first in Philadelphia. She happened to be in Chicago in 1871 when the huge fire broke out there. She lost many of her paintings in that fire. She went to Paris to study painting. She met Camille Pissarro there. He taught her Impressionism, a method of painting where the artists used small strokes of unmixed color1s to create an image. She once said of Pissarro that "" _ "" because he was such a good teacher. She spent a lot of time at the Louvre Museum copying paintings of the famous artists. In 1874, her sister, Lydia, came to live with her in Paris. Lydia was her best friend and posed for many of Mary's paintings. Three years later, her parents came to Paris, also to live with them. Lydia became very ill and died from a disease. Mary missed her very much. Her parents became elderly and she cared for them, but she still found time to paint. One of the more interesting works of Mary Cassatt is her painting, Portrait of Mrs. Curry, Sketch of Mr. Cassatt. Though she never had children of her own, she loved children and painted portraits of the children of her friends and family. She became known as the painter of mothers and children. She lost her sight due to cataracts in her eyes in 1914 and was not able to paint during the later years of her life."	['The family wanted their children to learn about Europe.']
What does the passage mainly tell us?	"A famous study was done in a school by a professor from a university. At the start of the school year, the teachers were given the names of five children. They were told that these five were the most excellent students in the class. But the fact was that these students were only average ,and they were not the best students at all. Well, guess what? At the end of the year, all the five average students scored among the highest in the class. What made these average students change so much to become top students?The only difference was the change in their teachers' attitude . Because the teachers believed that these five kids were the top students,they expected more from them. And so these five average students began to believe and expect more from themselves. So they worked harder to do as well as they could. Do you know why? If you expect the best from people, they'll usually want to give you their best. A great leader said, ""Treat a person just how he appears to be on the outside, and you'll make him even worse. But treat a person like he's already a success,and you'll help make him the best he can be."" Like the true story of 7-year-old Johnny, his teacher got so angry with him that one day she said,""Johnny,you're the naughtiest boy in this class. I'm sure you'll never change."" The next year Johnny had a new teacher. And on the first day of class,she met with Johnny after school and said,""Johnny, I've heard a lot about you! But do you know that I don't believe a word of it."" And every day after that, this new teacher treated Johnny as if he was one of the smartest students even when Johnny did naughty things. Later on, Johnny became a school leader. Because that's the power of our belief and attitude toward children."	['Attitude and belief can change a person.']
According to Paragraph 2, what would overjoy John most the next year?	"In the very early 1800's, a young boy about 14 years old named John lived in a orphanage in Old England along with several other children. Orphan meant unwanted and unloved. Christmas was the one day of the year when the children didn't work and received a gift, an orange. Usually they tried to taste and keep it for so long that it often went bad before they ever peeled it to enjoy the sweet juice. Many thoughts were expressed as Christmas time drew near. The children would say, ""I will keep mine the longest."" John usually slept with his next to his pillow. This year John was overjoyed by the Christmas season. He was becoming a man and stronger and soon he would be old enough to leave. He would save his orange until his birthday in July. Christmas day finally came. The children were so excited as they entered the big dinning hall. Immediately the master shouted, ""John, leave the hall and there will be no orange for you this year."" John's heart broke violently wide open. He turned and went quickly back to the cold room. Then he heard the door open and each of the children entered. Little Elizabeth with her hair falling over her shoulders, a smile on her face, and tears in her eyes held out a piece of rag to John. ""Here John,"" she said, ""this is for you."" As he lifted back the edges of the rag he saw a big juicy orange all peeled and quartered and then he realized what they had done. John never forgot the sharing, love and personal sacrifice his friends had shown him that Christmas day. In memory of that day every year he would send oranges all over the world to children everywhere."	['He would eat his orange on his birthday.']
The writer thought he was a _ husband in the past.	"I made a pledge to myself on the way down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. The idea had come to me as I listened to a talk on my car radio. The speaker was quoting a Biblical passage about husbands being thoughtful of their wives. Then he went on to say, ""Love is an act of will. A person can choose to love."" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change. And it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, ""That new yellow sweater looks great on you."" ""Oh, Tom, you noticed,"" she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little puzzled. After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought, ""Evelyn's been alone here with kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me."" We walked on the beach while the children flew the kites. So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street firm where I am a director; a visit to the shell museum though I usually hate museums. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new pledge to keep on remembering to choose love. There was _ that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn stared at me with the saddest expression. ""What's the matter?"" I asked her. ""Tom, "" she said in a voice filled with sadness, ""do you know something I don't?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Well.....that checkup I had several weeks ago..... our doctor ..... did he tell you something about me? Tom, you've been so good to me..... am I dying ?"" It took a moment for it all to sink in. Then I burst out laughing. ""No, honey,"" I said, wrapping her in my arms. ""You're not dying; I'm just start to live."""	['selfish']
Simon _ before last Sunday.	"Simon hardly listened to his teachers or worked hard in class. For him, talking was so much better. He never stopped talking. He wanted to be heard. ""If you listen carefully, you'll learn something."" Mrs. Jacobs told him many times, but it didn't work. Last Sunday, Simon had a sore throat and he lost his voice the next morning. ""Can I stay home?"" he tried to ask, but words didn't come out. His mother thought he could go to school. He felt upset. When he got to school, he didn't say anything to his friends or teachers. Everyone started talking at once. They were excited, worried and surprised. Mrs. Jacobs seemed happy. Simon was bored because he couldn't talk. But it wasn't so bad. He could do his homework. The next day, even though his voice was coming back, he stayed quiet again. He listened and put up his hand to speak. What a great difference! ,."	['liked talking']
If your friend says that he is in Dutch, he most probably means that _ .	"""Let's go Dutch, shall we?"" Jim said after a dinner to his friends in a restaurant. What does Jim mean? Long ago, there was a kind of dinner called Dutch treat . At a Dutch treat, the invited guests were expected to pay for their own share of the food and drink. Now, Dutch treat means when friends go out to have fun, each person pays his or her own share. There are many other expressions related with ""Dutch"" in American English. However, most of them were first used in England in the 17th century. At that time, the British and the Dutch were war enemies. So when British people talked about something wrong or bad, they would like to use the word ""Dutch"". A common expression heard a few years ago was in Dutch. A friend may tell you, ""You are in Dutch. The teacher is angry with you. Be careful!"" When a soldier took Dutch leave, he left the army without permission. Dutch courage was the false courage produced by the effects of drinking wine. There is one expression that did come from the Dutch. That is to talk like a Dutch uncle. The Dutch were known for the strict and serious way they educated their children."	['he is in trouble']
What does the story mainly talk about?	"Whether you're eating at a fancy restaurant or dining in someone's home. Proper table manners are likely to help you make a good impression. According to a US expert, Emily Post, ""All rules of table manners are made to avoid ugliness."" While Henry Hitchings of the Los Angeles Times admits that good manners can reduce social conflict, he points out that mostly their purpose is protective - they turn our natural warrior-like selves into more elegant ones. So where did table manners come from? In medieval England, a writer named Petrus Alfonsi took the lead to urge people not to speak with their mouths full. And King David I of Scotland also proposed that any of his people who learned to eat more neatly be given a tax deduction . Disappointingly, that idea never _ . It was during the Renaissance, when there were real technical developments, opinions of correct behavior changed for good. ""None of these was more significant than the introduction of the table fork,"" wrote Hitchings. ""Gradually, as forks became popular, they brought the new way of eating, making it possible, for instance, to consume berries without making one's fingers dirty."" Forks were introduced to Britain in 1608 and 25 years later, the first table fork reached America. Yet while most of the essentials are the same on both sides of the Atlantic, there are a few clear differences between what's normal in the US and what holds true in the UK. For example, in the US, when food needs cutting with a knife, people generally cut a bite, then lay aside the knife and switch the fork to their right hand. Then they pick up one bite at a time. By contrast, Britons keep the fork in the left hand and don't lay the knife down. Though globalization has developed a new, simpler international standard of table manners, some people still stick with the American cut-and-switch method.The Los Angeles Times noted, ""They are hanging on to a form of behavior that favors manners above efficiency."""

What can we learn from the passage?	"So you think you know your dog. But how well does your dog know you? She probably recognizes you when she sees you. But can a dog tell by simply looking at you whether you have a happy or an angry expression on your face? Researchers in Austria have taught pet dogs to know the difference. Dogs are very mindful of sound. When dog owners shout or speak in a strong, unkind voice, dogs often act ashamed and quietly move away from the area. Recently, researchers found that dogs can look at our faces, and tell the difference between a smile and a frown . The animals were able to recognize a look of praise from one of blame. Researchers at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna performed a series of experiments. They taught dogs to recognize facial expressions. They showed the dogs two pictures of either the upper or lower half of a person's face. On one picture, the person looked happy. The other appeared angry. The dogs were then shown images of the eyes or mouths of people they had never seen before. They were also shown the left half of the faces used in training. Corsin Muller led the study. ""We were really speaking, do they realize that smiling eyes have the same meaning as a smiling mouth, or angry eyes have the same meaning as an angry mouth? And it turned out that they really did perform very well in these research experiments."" Once the dogs learned to recognize which image was happy or angry, they could easily find the same expressions in pictures of any face. Corsin Muller says future studies will try to show whether dogs can learn the meaning of facial expressions--for example, whether a frown shows that someone is angry. In the experiments, researchers found the dogs were slower to link a reward, or prize, with recognition of the angry face. This suggested that dogs had an idea people with angry faces were best avoided."	"[""Dogs can understand man's feelings.""]"
"What does ""talking pictures"" mean according to this article?"	"How can you hear your friends' voices when they are far away and you can't make a long--distance call? Besides the web camera system with your computer, we have a new high-tech way to solve the problem and ease your pain of missing them. The Japanese company Combiwith created a system-- . It makes people in pictures speak! The ""talking picture"" has a special pen. It is actually a pen-shaped scanner. It can scan information in special--made pictures. A connected player will then play the information out loud. First, you need to take a picture and record what you want to say with the company. The company will then make special barcodes onto your picture(you can't see those codes). Those codes are your voice and your words. When you hold up the pen to scan your picture with barcodes, a player connected to the pen will start to play. It plays things you've recorded. That way the invention makes the ""you"" in the picture speak! Do you want your friends and families talking out of pictures? Have them make pictures like that, and you can hear them whenever you want, only with the ""talking picture"" system. The system can play messages for up to 12 minutes. ""The pictures would be useful for those who hope to hear the voice of someone living far away,"" said Mayumi Fuji, a spokeswoman for the company. ""Grandparents, for example, longing to know about their grandchildren, would be happy to hear their voice when they see the picture,"" Fuji said. But it is troublesome to go to the company for taking a special picture first. And, it is much more expensive than using a telephone. The photo with barcodes costs between 17,040 and 17,990 yen (160 and 169 dollars). The larger picture you want, the more you pay. Now, just raise a finger, lonely people can have their loved ones speak out of pictures. But, whether the ""talking picture"" is practical or not, let's wait and see."

How old was Thomas Jefferson when he became Governor of Virginia?	As we all know, it was Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of the Independence. He wrote it in two weeks, and after a few changes, it was accepted by the Congress. As a result, he became famous. Born in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, a brilliant student at school and almost talented lawyer later, was much interested in politics. Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia in 1779, and he was sent to France as the representative of the American government in 1784. Sixteen years later, at the age of 57, he was elected president after Washington and Adams. Far from a handsome man, he was tall with long arms and big hands. Jefferson, who was an amusing talker in conversation but a poor speaker, was generally good-natured. Jefferson was regarded as a defender of freedom on America. As a president, he protected the right of free speech. Interestingly enough, in his eight years as President, Jefferson never vetoed a bill which Congress had passed. He did a lot in organizing the new University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson died on July the fourth, 1826, the 50th anniversary of American Independence.	['He was 36.']

Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"You've probably heard about sports coaches, fitness coaches, voice and music teachers, career counselors, psychiatrists and other specialists who teach skills and help us cope with daily life. But there's a rapidly growing kind of professional who does a little bit of everything. She or he is called a "" _ "". People who are at crossroads in their lives, and corporations that want to give certain employees a career boost, are turning to them for help. The idea that one person's success story can change other people's lives for the better goes back at least to the 1930s. Dale Carnegie's famous self-improvement program ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" came along soon thereafter. But this new style of life coaches includes more than enthusiastic speakers or writers. They use their own experiences in business, sports, military service, or psychotherapy to help others make critical life decisions. They often give their approach a slogan, such as ""energy coaching"" or ""fearless living"" or ""working yourself happy"". Dave Lakhani in Boise, Idaho, for instance, works with salespeople to develop what he calls a ""road map"". He says an ongoing relationship with a coach is like having a personal fitness trainer for one's career and life outside work. Lakhani's Bold Approach coaching firm also donates some of its time to help people who are anything but successful---including battered women and struggling single mothers. But others in the so-called ""helping professions"" are not thrilled about the life-coaching movement. They say that anyone, trained or untrained, can call himself or herself a life coach, and that slick promoters who mess with people's lives can do more harm than good."

According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	When many people in the west think of China, the animal that they think of is the dragon. For them, the dragon is an aggressive monster that breathes fire. Many popular legends tell how dragons have killed brave knights and eaten beautiful young girls. For Chinese people, however, the dragon is not an evil monster. It's a cultural and spiritual symbol for prosperity and good luck. The dragon's main task is to create harmony and bring rain. Dragons are celebrated in art and architecture, and of course the dragon dance is a very popular ritual . China isn't the only country to have the dragon as its symbol. Wales in the UK, has a red dragon proudly displayed on its flag. Another country in the world with a dragon on its flag is Bhutan, a tiny country between China and India. Almost all countries in the world have an animal symbol representing their countries. This is particularly obvious during sports. The English think lions to be brave and proud animal and the English football teams have three lions on their football shirts. Australia is famous for kangaroos, of course. The national rugby team is more commonly known as the Wallabies, a type of small kangaroo.The South African team is known as the Springboks, a type of African antelope. Likewise the New Zealanders, whether playing sports or not, are commonly known as kiwis. A kiwi is a native New Zealand bird that can't fly. All countries are proud of their symbols, which they feel reflect national characteristics or the beauty and variety of their natural environments. Recently, a Shang hai professor claimed that using the dragon as a national symbol could make western countries have a negative view of China. But in an Internet survey 90% of Chinese people wanted to keep the dragon.	['The dragon is mentioned to have been used on the flag in two countries.']
Which of the following information about Tuvalu is WRONG?	"Tuvalu is located in the South Pacific. It is tiny and has only nine islands with a population of just 11,000. In 1999, it was the third- poorest country in the world. The islanders earned just $1,000 each year. But then something unusual happened. Tuvalu received an internet domain name--the letters ""tv"". These letters were very interesting for many companies around the world. A communication company from California offered to buy the domain name ""tv"" for $40 m. For the Tuvalans this was a very large amount of money. The islanders became very rich. Because of global warming, and because the islands are only 3m above sea level, Tuvalu will probably become the first country in the world that will disappear under the sea. You can already see signs of the rising sea on Tuvalu. Some beaches are disappearing and you can see tree roots by the ocean. Cyclones used to be very rare but they now appear a few times a year, and the rains that come with the cyclones cause flooding. Despite these problems, the Tuvalans had their new money. They could use it to buy themselves a future. Or at least they could use it to buy some time. Paul Lindsay, a documentary film-maker, took these questions with him all the way to Tuvalu, and came back with an incredible story. As the water rises, the Tuvalans are using the money to develop the land. They are building new houses, planning nightclubs, restaurants and hotels and new cars are driving around on new roads. The residents do not think this is strange: ""Just because we are sinking, it doesn't mean we don't want to raise our standards of living."" Sam Teo, Tuvalu's minister for natural resources told Lindsay."	['The average income of the Tuvalans is $1000 in 1999.']
What is the author's purpose in writing the passage?	"People talk about energy everywhere. Green energy, for example. Then, energy independence. It has a nice ring to it. Doesn't it? If you think so, you're not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession . ""Energy independence"" and its rhetorical companion ""energy security"" are, however, unreliable concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it that we want independence from, exactly? Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere. The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle of biofuel available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction. Second, Americans have basically decided that they don't really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to tolerate the environmental influence of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports? Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don't read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries. There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to keep its economy stable. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices. At the same time, we get massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world."	"[""To argue for America's dependence on oil imports.""]"
Which of the following best describe Antonio C?.	An Italian couple are to become the world's oldest divorcees, after the 99 - year - old husband found that his 96 - year - old wife had an affair in the 1940s. The Italian man, called by lawyers in the case as Antonio C, was looking through an old drawer when he made the discovery a few days before Christmas. In spite of the time that had passed since the affair, he was so upset that he immediately asked his wife of 77years, named as Rosa C, whether it was true, and demanded a divorce. Stricken by the guilt, she reportedly admitted everything but was unable to persuade her husband to reconsider his decision, though her children also did much more work. She wrote the letters to her lover during a secret affair in the 1940s, according to court papers _ in Rome this week, which made people know the truth. The couple are now preparing to split; though the marriage they built has lasted over nearly eight decades- they have five children, a dozen grandchildren and one great - grand child. The discovery of the letters was the final problem for their marriage which had already run into difficulty-10 years ago the husband briefly left their house in Rome and moved in with one of his sons, only to return a few weeks later. The Italian thought the fierce split resulted from the couple's southern blood he is originally from Olbia in Sardinia: while his wife was born in Naples. The couple met during the 1930s when Antonio served as a young officer. The case appears to set a new record, at least for the age of the oldest figures - the previous oldest couple to divorce were Bertie and Jessie Wood, both aged 98, from the UK. That pair ended their 36 - year marriage in 2009 when they were both two years away from their l00th birthdays.They got married in Elstree, Hertfordshire, in 1972, having both ended previous marriages, before moving to Falmouth, Cornwall four years later.

What's the purpose of the text?	Vending machines are found in 16% of U.S.elementary schools, 52% of middle schools and 88% of high schools.About 22% of students in grades 1 through 12 buy food in vending machines each day--and those purchases added an average of 253 calories to their diets, according to a new study in the September issue of the Journal of School Health. Just to be clear, those were not 253 calories' worth of tofu, yogurt or carrot.The most popular vending machine items included soft drinks, candy, chips, crackers, cookies, cakes and ice cream.On the plus side , kids also bought low-fat milk, fruit juice and even fruit, the study found. But the eventual effect on kids' diets was not good.Those who bought from vending machines ate an average of 156 grams of sugar per day, compared with 146 grams for those who abstained .They also consumed less fiber, iron and vitamin B. _ Vending machine customers ate 4% less sodium than other students--an average of 3,287 milligrams per day compared with 3,436 mg for those who didn't buy from vending machines.That's probably because the extra snacks made kids too full to eat as much at mealtimes, when dishes are especially Salty.In any event, kids should eat no more than 1,200 to 1,500 mg of sodium each day, according to the Mayo Clinic.Even for adults, the government recommends a daily limit of 2,300 mg. Overall, vending machines in school appear to be a threat to children's health.The researchers calculated that all that snacking adds up to about14 extra pounds per child per school year.For some students this might be a serious contributor to weight issues.The study was based on data collected from 2,309 children nationwide for the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, which was conducted by the U.S.Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service.

The passage is intended for _ .	How can we reduce the risk? There are four general approaches to dealing with volcanic dangers. We can try to keep the danger from occurring-often an impossible task. We can try to change its path or reduce its impact on existing development. We can take steps to protect future development. We can also do our best to have disaster response plans in place before they are needed. Removing the Threat Clearly, there is no way to stop an eruption. We can, however, attempt to reduce the eruption's effects by strengthening structures, for example, building protective works such as walls to make lava flow away from developed areas. Such efforts can be and have been successful, but are of limited use in a large-scale eruption. Planning for the Future Protecting future development from volcanic dangers is a simple task. Before building houses, we should judge the risk. If the risk seems too great, a safer location should be found. This type of planning is very effective, but all too often, people are drawn to the lush ,rolling land of a quiet volcano. Disaster Preparedness When a volcano comes to life, a few weeks may not be enough time to avoid a tragedy. Planning is the key to saving lives. Well before the warning signs occur, people must be educated about volcanic dangers. Escape plans must be in place. Communication between scientists, officials, the media, and the general public should be practiced. Emergency measures must be thought out and agreed upon. If you doubt the importance of these efforts, take another look at past volcanic tragedies, such as the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz. Communication failures left the town of Armero unprepared for escape. When a deadly mudflow came down the slope , 21,000 people--90 percent of the town's people--died.	['the general public']
Which of the following time orders describes the births of the great logos?	"I was reading these interesting stories behind a group of great logos in the world. Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for $ 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's "" rainbow apple"", a rainbow- colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926. Adidas The Adidas logo, which was created by the founder of the company Adi Dassler, represents mountains, pointing towards the challenges that are seen ahead and goals that can be achieved. The logo was used for the first time in 1976."	"[""Mercedes Benz - McDonald's - Nike - Apple.""]"

.Which of the following words best describes Mark Zukerberg according to the passage?	Mark Zukerberg is the founder and CEO of Facebook, an extremely popular social working website that started in the United States. Now, millions of student users visit Facebook daily and the website is one of the top ten widely visited sites on the Internet worldwide. College and high school students use Facebook to communicate with friends and share both information and pictures for free. The company earns money through advertising. Many other companies have been rumored to be interested in buying Facebook. Just a few years after Mark started the company, he was approached by Terry Semel, who was the CEO of Yahoo. Terry offered Mark one billion dollars($1,000,000,000) to sell Facebook to Yahoo. Mark said no, though. He stands behind his dreams at the very beginning. He knows the value of the company could fall down; however, he is in this to build something unbelievable, not be bought out by another company. Maybe he was smart. Now Facebook is rumored to be worth billions of dollars and bigger companies like Microsoft or Google want a share of the company. Some private firms are also interested. Facebook could sell 15billion dollars if Mark decides to sell it at all. Perhaps Mark will just keep working from his California office to continue his dream of building something cool.

In fact, _ .	"Charlie studied in a famous college for four years. He studied hard and did well in all his subjects. He hoped to become a good teacher. This year he left the college and began to work in a middle school. He likes his students and is strict with them. He does his best to make his classes lively and interesting. One day he carefully explained a chemical reaction to the students of Grade 2 in the chemistry lab. ""Be careful, everyone,"" he said loudly. ""Before I make the experiment,there're twenty five atoms of carbon ,but after I finish it, there're twenty four atoms of carbon left!""

Keesh showed his courage at the council meeting by _ .	"Keesh lived at the North Pole a long time ago. He lived near the edge of the polar sea. He was a bright thirteen-year-old boy with a strong, healthy body. His father was a brave man who had died during a food shortage in the village. His father tried to save the lives of his people by fighting a giant polar bear. Keesh's father was crushed to death during the struggle. But he killed the bear, and the meat from the bear kept the people from starving. Keesh was his only son, and he lived alone with his mother. But people are forgetful, and they soon forgot how Keesh's father had saved their lives. And since Keesh was only a boy and his mother was a woman and not a warrior , they were forced to live in the smallest and poorest igloo in the village. One night there was a council meeting in the large igloo of Klosh-Kwan, who was the chief. At that meeting Keesh showed how much courage he possessed. He rose to his feet and waited for silence. Then, with the dignity of an older man, he said, "" It is true that my mother and I are given meat to eat. But the meat is always old and tough, filled with bones, and difficult to eat."" The hunters--both the young and the old--were shocked to hear a child speak to them that way. But Keesh went on steadily, ""Because my father, Bok, was a great hunter, I can speak these words. You know that Bok brought home more meat than any hunter in the village. The oldest woman, the weakest old man, received a fair share."" Keesh waited calmly until the shouting died down. ""My mother has no one except me, and therefore I must speak. My father put his life in danger and died, to provide food for this village. It is only right that I, his son and his wife should have enough good meat as long as there is plenty of good meat in this village. I, Keesh, the son of Bok, have spoken."" He sat down. He could hear angry murmuring all around him. Some men began to shout at Keesh. They ordered him to leave. They threatened to punish him by not giving him any food at all. Keesh's eyes flashed and the blood pounded under his skin. In the midst of the noise and the uproar, he jumped to his feet. ""Listen to me, you men!"" he shouted. ""I shall never speak in this council again--not until you come to invite me to speak. My father was a great hunter, and so will I be."" They laughed at Keesh and followed him out of the igloo, shouting at him. But Keesh said nothing more. He walked away with his head raised, looking neither to the left nor the right.... ---Based on a story by Jack London"	['complaining of the unfair treatment he and his mother received']
The most important character of this kind of bike is its _ .	"Zipped into a bag, it looks like a large umbrella. Unfolded, it goes along the street like any other bicycle. It's the ""A-bike"", the brainchild of British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, who made history in the 1970s by developing the world's first pocket calculator. He described his new invention as ""the world's smallest, lightest foldable bicycle"". ""My original thought was that if you could have a bicycle that was dramatically lighter and more firm than the ones that exist today, it would change the way in which bicycles are used,""said Sinclair. The mini-bike, showed in Singapore last week and set to go on sale worldwide in 2005 at a price of nearly US$300, is built for riders as heavy as 112 kilograms and is height-adjustable . It takes about 20 seconds to fold or unfold. Its wheels are a quarter the size of those on a regular bicycle, but Sinclair promises a smooth ride for most cyclists. ""You require no extra energy to ride the A-bike and it can go up to 15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour),"" he said. Constructed mainly of plastic, the 5.5-kilogram bicycle folds into a package of less than 0.03 cubic meters . Sinclair also invented the first pocket TV in 1984 and the futuristic C5 electric tricycle in 1985. He said he hoped the bicycle would attract common citizens, officials, campers or anyone needing transport for a short trip and he said the next step for the A-bike was to add an electric motor in a few years."

What would be the best title for the passage?	"When a store sells goods or services at a price lower than usual, it is called a sale. Sales last for a limited time. Then the price returns to normal. There are many kinds of sales. For example, a ""back-to-school"" sale is held near the beginning of the school year. A ""midnight madness"" event starts very late at night. An ""early bird special"" sale starts very early in the morning, usually before the sunrise. This kind of sale is popular the day after Thanksgiving in November. A favorite sale among many people is the ""buy one, get one free"" sale. You buy one thing and get a second one without cost. When people see the word ""free"" in an advertisement they think they will _ . Another kind of sale is a ""going out of business"" sale. This is when a storekeeper tries to sell all the goods before closing the business for ever. Take the store selling floor coverings for example, the owner lowers the prices and puts up a sign:""Going out of business sale. All items MUST be sold by tomorrow."" People who buy the floor coverings think they are getting a special price because everything must be sold in a short period of time. Then, a few days later they see the store did not close. And they see the same sign that says the store is going out of business. Some business owners really do not end the business but want to make more money. In prefix = st1 /America, you can always find a good sale, no matter the day or the time of a year . There is the Independence Day sale, Veteran's Day sale, clearance sale, sidewalk sale, red tag sale, white sale, blue light special, liquidation sale, half-off sale, warehouse sale, tent sale..."

What is TRUE about Jack London?	"Jack London had endured more hardships by the age of twenty-one than most people experience in a lifetime. His struggles developed in him sympathy for the working class and a lasting dislike of hard work and provided inspiration for his career as a writer. London grew up in San Francisco in extreme poverty. At an early age, he left school and supported himself through a succession of un skilled jobs ----working as a paper boy, in bowling alleys, on ice wagons, and in canneries and mills. Despite working long hours at these jobs, London was able to read constantly, borrowing travel and adventure books from the library. The books London read inspired him to travel, and his job experiences led him to become active in fighting for the fights of workers. He sailed to Japan on a journey aiming at catching seals and joined a cross-country protest march with a group of unemployed workers. After being arrested for vagrancy near Buffalo, New York, London decided to educate himself and reshape his life. He quickly completed high school and entered the University of California. After only one term, however, the appeal of fortune and adventure proved uncontrollable. London gave up his studies and traveled to the Alaskan Yukon in 1897 in search of gold. Jack London was among the first of these miners. He may have searched for more than gold, however. London once commented, "" True, the new region was mostly poor; but its several hundred thousand square miles of coldness at least gave breathing space to those who else would have choked at home."" Although he was unsuccessful as a miner, London's experiences in Alaska taught him about the human desire for wealth and power and about humankind's inability to control the forces of nature. While in Alaska, London also absorbed memories and stories that would make him known one hundred years later. Once back in California, London became determined to earn a living as a writer. He rented a typewriter and worked up to fifteen hours a day, spinning his Alaskan adventures into short stories and novels. According to legend, London's piles of rejection slips from publishers grew to five feet in height! Even so, London preserved. In 1903, he earned national fame when he published the popular novelThe Call of the Wild. He soon became the highest paid and most industrious writer in the country. During his career, he produced more than fifty books and earned more than a million dollars. Several of his novels, includingThe Call of the Wild(1903),the Sea-Wolf(1904),the White Fang(1906),have become American classics. In fact, he was a creative writer whose fiction explored several regions and their cultures: the Yukon, California, Hawaii, and the Solomon Islands. He experimented with many literary forms, from traditional love stories and dystopias to science fantasy. His noted journalism included war communication, boxing stories, and the life of Molokai lepers . He was among the most influential figures of his day, who understood how to create a public persona and use the media to market his self-created image of poor-boy-turned-success. London's great passion was agriculture, and he was well on the way of creating a new model for spreading through his Beauty Ranch when he died of kidney disease at age 40. He left over fifty books of novels, stories, journalism, and essays, many of which have been translated and continue to be read around the world. His best works describe a person's struggle for survival against the powerful forces of nature. ""To Build a Fire"", for example, tells the story of a man's fight to survive the harsh cold of the Alaskan winter."

Why are people in the US afraid to spend?	"Most American students have to say goodbye to fancy fruits these days. In school restaurants across the country, cheaper fruits like apples and oranges have taken their place. ""People are afraid to spend now."" said Linda Morrow, who owns a shoe and handbag store. ""They don't know what the future will bring"". During the financial crisis , several of the country's biggest banks have been forced to sell or close. This has made lots of Americans afraid to buy expensive things. The crisis began last year. Experts think it was because US banks lend money too easily. Last year a lot of people and companies, who borrowed money, found themselves unable to pay it back. This left the banks, as well as the people who put their money in the banks, without money. Since the banks borrowed money between themselves and even across borders , the whole world was in trouble. This month the US government agreed on a $700 billion plan to try to save the financial market. But no one is sure whether it will help or not. Last week presidents from 20 countries promised to work together to find a way out of the money trouble."	['Because they worry about their future']

Some people are leaving Italy mainly because they _ .	More and more Italians are leaving their country because they can not get a job. One in every three Italians say they are willing to go abroad, sometimes even to other continents to get work. Currently, about 300,000 young Italians may be living abroad. Although emigration has always been a choice for Italians, especially for those who left the country at the beginning of the twentieth century, more young Italians think leaving their home country is the only way to escape economic difficulty. These young Italians, however, are not poor farmers or laborers but bright university graduates and other talented young people. Many of them want to go to richer places, like northern Europe, but they are also prepared to go elsewhere. Most of them describe a feeling of unhappiness and frustration. They are not sure which direction their country is heading and feel no longer proud of being Italians. Many leave because they think that getting a good job is possible in other countries where all doors are open to you if you are young and dynamic. However, in Italy everything is boring and old-fashioned. Italy's economic system is largely based on family structures and the elderly who don't want to give up power. Corruption is also a big problem that simply won't go away. The Italian government is aware of the problem and says it must create new opportunities for its younger generation. But even if it starts working on a new style economy right away it may take years before things in Italy really change. The government has already passed laws which will make it easier for doctors, lawyers and other academics to start a career in Italy. Many economic experts claim that Italy is doing a lot for its older generation but very little for its youth. For example, it spends little on housing, childcare but a lot on pensions.

The world's largest aquarium is located in _ .	"Ralph and Norton can grow to be 40 feet long and live in a tank as large as a football field.What are they? They're the only two whale sharks at a North American aquarium . You can see Ralph and Norton at the world's largest aquarium, the new Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. The aquarium's giant tanks hold eight million gallons of water and will be home to about 100,000 fish! The aquarium was designed to look like a giant ship breaking through the waves.It has 60 different habitats from the sea and five galleries , each with a different theme.About 2.4 million visitors are expected to come each year. _ "" Said Jeff Swanagan, the aquarium's executive director. Ralph and Norton arrived in June, 2005 from Taiwan.They were only 15 and 13 feet long, but they may grow to be more than 40 feet long! Whale sharks are the world's largest fish.Three full-time vets will work there to make sure that Ralph, Norton, and all of the aquarium's sea life stay healthy.Students from the University of Georgia will help run the aquarium and conduct research at the animal hospital. The aquarium was paid for almost completely by a $ 200 million gift from Bemie Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot Inc, and his wife, Billi.""It's going to be the most unique aquarium in the world,"" said Marcus.Marcus said the aquarium was a ""thank you"" note to the city of Atlanta and the State of Georgia, where the Home Depot first opened for business."

The old man carried an umbrella with him because _ .	"It was a beautiful spring morning, and the sun was warm but not too hot, so Mr Green was surprised when he saw an old gentleman at the bus stop with a big, strong, black umbrella in his hand. Mr Green said to him, ""Do you think we're going to have rain today!"" ""No,"" said the old gentleman, ""I don't think so."" ""Then are you carrying the umbrella to keep the sun off you?"" ""No, the sun is not very hot in spring."" Mr Green looked at the big umbrella again, and the gentleman said, ""I am an old man, and my legs are not very strong. I really need a walking-stick.

Mars One is a program that focuses on _ .	"A MILLION people on Mars within 100 years. This is the brave vision of Elon Musk, the founder of the space technology company SpaceX. ""We need to be laser-focused on becoming a multi-planet civilization. That's the next step,"" he said in a recent interview with Aeon magazine. Musk expects to see about 80,000 people living on Mars by 2040. It's all about protecting the human race from extinction, according to Musk. The Earth has always been a ticking time bomb. As the sun begins to die, it will grow bigger, becoming what is known as a Red Giant. In 500 million years, the sun will have become large enough to kill off any plant and animal life on Earth, according to US scientist Edward Guinan. In a billion years, the Earth will have become a hot planet with little or no water. The brave dream of getting the human race to Mars is not only Musk's; others have made plans, too. A Dutch entrepreneur set up the Mars One foundation in 2011, hoping to be the first project to put humans on Mars. It received over 200,000 applications to become part of the first group of astronauts to go there. According to Mars One, ""human settlement on Mars is possible with existing technologies."" Water, food, energy, and oxygen are needed for life anywhere. According to Mars One, water that was still in the Martian soil would be boiled and taken out. By using a process called ""electrolysis"", astronauts could split water into hydrogen and oxygen for breathing. Astronauts on the International Space Station have already done similar things. Food can also be grown in space. Certain plants such as lettuce and onions can be grown using LED light for different color spectrums and much less heat. NASA has been researching this to prepare for visiting Mars. But how will people get there? The Mars One project plans to use SpaceX's Dragon capsule as part of its mission. But it is rumored that Musk already has a design in mind for a giant spaceship. He calls it the Mars Colonial Transporter."	['setting up the first human settlement on Mars']
What's the main idea of this passage?	"Sadness and happiness are often talked about by people in their spare time. Most people want themselves to be happy for ever, but few know how to find happiness. Others say if you own lots of money and success, you will be happy. However, money and success alone do notbring lasting happiness. A famous a Greek thinker, Aristotle, said, ""Happiness depends upon ourselves."" That's to say,we make our own happiness. Here are a few suggestions to help you be happier. The first secret of happiness is to enjoy the simple things in life. Too often, we spend so much timethinking about the future. For example, getting into college or getting a good job, which we fail to enjoy thepresent. You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have several close friends often live happier and healthier lives. Another secret to living a happy life is to be active. Many people go dancing or play sports. People can forget about their problems and only think about the activities. Finally, many people find happiness in helping others. Studies show that people feel good when they spend their time helping others. If you want to feel happier, do good things for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping or help out with some things around the house for an elderly person. If you do above, you will be happy."	['How to live a happy life.']
"Why does ""the present""mean ""nothing ""when we travel at high speeds?"	Future history books might record that we were robbed of the use of our eyes ,In our hurry to get from one place to another, we fail to see anything on the way, Air travel gives you a bird's -eye view of the world ---or even less if the wing of the aircraft happens to _ When you travel by car or train , you are moving so quickly that you do not see the countryside clearly , Car drivers are forever thinking about going on and on; they never want to stop, Is it the great motorways ,that attract them, or what? And as for sea travel ,it hardly deserves mention ,It is perfectly summed up in the words of the old song:'I joined the navy to see the world ,and what did I see? I saw the sea'. You mention the place names in the world like EI Dorado, Kabul and someone is sure to say'I've been there'meaning ,'I drove through it at 100 miles an hour on the way to somewhere else.' When you travel at high speeds, the present means nothing :you live mainly in the future because you spend most of your time looking forward to arriving at some other place, But actual arrival ,when it is achieved , is meaningless , You want to move on again . By traveling like this, you suspend all experience; the present stops being a reality:you might just as well be dead. The traveler on foot, on the other hand , lives constantly in the present, For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes, He experiences, the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body, At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical tiredness, Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers.

Why was the author disappointed in her husband or her children?	"Our cat has a sweet nature, and she can let us know what she wants. When we fail to meet her needs, she gently leads us in the proper direction. When I forget to fill her water bowl early in the morning, she runs after my legs, and then pushes me in the direction of her bowl. She doesn't get irritated ; instead, she expresses her wishes in the best way. And I always understand what she is telling me. One day I found myself envying her simple expression. How many times had I expected my husband or my children to know my wants without my ever giving voice to them? How many times had I been disappointed that they couldn't understand when I needed a hug, a compliment or a chocolate bar? After a pleasant afternoon with my husband, I wanted to stop somewhere nice and have dinner, but he didn't understand my hints . ""Couldn't you see that I wanted to go out to dinner?"" I complained when he pulled into our driveway. ""Why didn't you say so? I can't read your mind,"" he answered in impatience. _ . Had I expected him to read my mind? Why hadn't I expressed my desire more clearly? I realized I had fallen into the female trap of ""If you love me, you can read my mind."" Now, I state my needs clearly and directly. I look at my cat and know she agrees."	"[""They didn't understand her mind.""]"

According to the passage, what do we know about Yeats's life?	"William Butler Yeats, a most famous Irish writer, was born in Dublin on June 13, 1865. His childhood lacked the harmony that was typical of a happy family. Later, Yeats shocked his family by saying that he remembered ""little of childhood but its pain"". In fact, he inherited excellent taste in art from his family--both his father and his brother were painters. But he finally settled on literature, particularly drama and poetry. Yeats had strong faith in the coming of new artistic movements. He set himself the fresh task in founding an Irish national theatre in the late 1890s. His early theatrical experiments, however, were not received favorably at beginning. He didn't lose heart, and finally enjoyed success in his poetical drama. Compared with his dramatic works, Yeats's poems attract much admiring notice. The subject matter includes love, nature, history, time and aging. Though Yeats generally relied on very traditional forms, he brought modern sensibility to them. As his literary life progressed, his poetry grew finer and richer, which led him to worldwide recognition. He had not enjoyed a major public life since winning the Nobel Price in 1923. Yet, he continued writing almost to the end of his life. Had Yeats stopped writing at age 40, he would probably now be valued as a minor poet, for there is no other example in literary history of a poet who produces his greatest works between the ages of 50 and 75. After Yeats' death in 1939, W. H. Auden wrote, among others, the following lines: Earth, receive an honored guest: William Yeats is laid to rest. Let the Irish vessel lie Emptied of its poetry."	['Yeats began to produce his best works from the 1910s']
"""Got your feet wet"" is a (n) _ ."	"I worked abroad one year ago Once I was sent to attend a conference. It was downpouring outside, Though I was holding an umbrella, my trouser legs as well as my shoes and socks still got wet. Entering the conference hall, I shook the umbrella, and at the same time, stamped my feet. Suddenly I caught sight of my chief boss strolling in. At that time,I just got the job.Therefor,I hurriedly went to meet this superior in the highest rank and introduced myself to him as I was a new comer.He said,""Yes,I recognize you.Got your feet wet?""I lowered my head to look at my wet trouser legs and with a helpless tone,I said,""Yeah,It's raining cats and dogs,isn't it?""Gazing at me for a moment,the chief boss said nothing with a amile. Later on, I mentioned the incident of meeting the chief boss to my colleague. Hence I learnt that I had made a big fool of myself. It turns out that ""Get one's feet wet"" is an American slang , with the meaning of reaching the state of affairs."" However, I regarded myself as humorous and replied with a slang sentence, which is seldom used now, describing the rain falling heavily. This was completely off the point. I am lucky that the chief boss is really gentle and did not point it out at once."	['American slang']
Where is the woman in the painting?	Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503.He was working on a special painting for a church at the time, but the church painting was not going well. An Italian businessman asked da Vinci to paint a picture of the businessman's second wife. This is the woman who can be seen in the Mona Lisa. All in all, the Mona Lisa is a very good example of da Vinci's work. Da Vinci uses darkness and light in a clever way in the painting. Da Vinci loved science and maths. Right away a person can see that there is a lot of geometry in the Mona Lisa. The face of the Mona Lisa is made of many circles and round shapes like balls. Even her smile can be seen as a small part of a large circle. The woman in the painting is sitting on a balcony , and mountains can be seen behind her. Da Vinci loved to study rocks and mountains, so these can be seen over and over in his other paintings. The woman is sitting with her knees to the side. Her head is turned to look out of the painting. Her hands are held together in front of her. This way of sitting is now used by many artists when they are painting a picture of a man or woman today.

Between the years of 1936 and 1938, he was further studying in Cambridge University in the U.K. In 1950, together with his family, he returned to China from the USA. He said, ""I'm Chinese, and I'll do my best for my motherland."" So he did. He devoted all his life to the math study and won the great fame for our country. He died for heart trouble in 1985 while lecturing in Japan. People will always remember him as a great scientist."	['a poor family']

This passage is mainly about _ .	"American and British people both speak English of course. But sometimes it does not seem like the same language. In fact, there are some important differences between British English and American English. First of all, they sound very different. Often, Americans don't say each word separately. They say several words together. Americans may say ""I dunno"" instead of ""I don't know"". Or they may say ""Whaddya say?"" instead of ""What did you say?"" however, the British are more careful in their speech. They usually say all the words and keep them _ . Words sometimes have different meanings too. Some American words are never used in England. The same thing is true of some British words in America. For example, the vocabulary for cars and driving is very different. Americans drive trucks, but in England people drive lorries. Many expressions are also different in the two countries. In England, if you are going to telephone your friends, you ""phone them up"". In America, you ""give them a call"". There're also some differences in grammar. For example, when Americans ask a question., they say ""Do you have a storybook?"" But the British often say ""Have you a storybook?"" All these differences can be confusing if you are learning English. But most languages are like this. Languages change over time. When people live in separate places, the languages change in different ways. This is what has happened to English. It can also happen to other languages, such as French. Many people in Canada speak French but their French is very different from the French of France."	['some differences between American and British English']
According to the article, starting by talking about the setting is meant to _ .	"How did your friendships begin? Most start with a short conversation on a random day. Asking about a homework assignment in class or complaining about your painful legs after playing in a soccer game, you found your best pal by accident. ""Small talk is where all your relationships begin,"" Forbes magazine summed up. The following is a five-step guide to making small talk from Bernardo J. Carducci, the director of the Shyness Research Institute at Indiana University Southeast, US. Let's have a look. Getting started Begin by talking about the setting, such as the weather outside or the room you are in (""It's cold in here, isn't it?""). The purpose of talking about the setting is to show the other person that you are willing to make a conversation. 2The personal introduction You should mention something about yourself, such as your name. A good personal introduction helps move the conversation forward. 3Looking for topics At this point, you and your conversation partner need to find common ground. This is a good time to ask questions or to refer back to things you've said or heard earlier. Don't worry if it gets quiet. The other person is probably just thinking of something to say. 4Expanding the topic The goal is to keep the conversation going. At every stage, you should be careful not to talk too much. But don't let the other person _ the conversation either. If that starts to happen, mention something about yourself when he or she takes a breath. 5A polite ending When ending a conversation, let the person know you'll be leaving soon, express gratitude for the conversation and set the stage for a future conversation. For example, you could say, ""I really must be going soon, but I had a great time chatting with you. I really liked hearing your opinion about that new movie. Here's my phone number. Call or text me if you know of any other movies you think I might enjoy."""	['make a conversation']
According to the passage, what made it possible for Horvath to develop Gyrotonics?	An exercise method (Gyrotonics) designed to stretch muscles and improve strength and balance is becoming popular in the United States. Here's more about Gyrotonics and the man who invented this special form of exercise. Gyrotonics is a kind of exercise that combines the movements of dancing and swimming with the mental and physical practice called yoga. It helps lengthen muscles, improve balance, and exercise the joints, the parts of the body where bones are joined. A Hungarian dancer named Juliu Horvath developed this special form of exercise. After he was injured in dancing, Mr. Horvath studied yoga intensely. In the 1980s, he developed a new exercise method as a special kind of yoga to strengthen dancers. According to Mr. Horvath, his method was based on the octopus ,monkey and cat. He says these animals have no restrictions. They can move in any direction the Gyrotonic movements to help the human body move more freely. A special machine made of wood and weights helps guide the body through the Gyrotonics exercises. You sit or lie on a flat board. You put your legs or hands through special cloth handles attached to a line with weights. With the tension created by the weights, you must try to move through the exercises. Seven kinds of backbone movements form the base of Gyrotonics. For example, you can stretch your back to the left and right or forward and backward. While moving your back, you can also work on arm or leg motions. These movements must be done in a smooth way. Often the motions are circular . When Juliu Horvath first developed Gyrotonics, he was the only teacher. Since then, he has taught almost 70 trainers. Now, there are more then 800 official schools in the world where you can learn Gyrotonics.	['His dancing-related injury.']
It can be known from the passage that the car accident happened _ .	"The bus driver and his passengers were being hailed as heroes last night after rescuing a woman from her burning car following a crash on the Bluff Highway. The 60-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Southland Hospital after firefighters battled for 30 minutes to cut her from her car. Acting Senior Sergeant Brock Davis of Invercargill, said emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at the crossroads of Motorimu Rd and State Highway I shortly before 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Mr. Davis said a Mitsubishi car driven by a 30-year-old man traveling north on the highway and the woman's southbound Suzuki Alto collided . The man suffered slight injuries in the crash, he said. Invercargill Passenger Transport Ltd driver Bill McDermott and his passengers--New Zealand Aluminum Smelters Ltd workers were first on the scene and alerted emergency services. The scene at the spot was disordered, Mr. McDermott said. ""There was a car on its side and a guy wandering around who was quite excited,"" he said. ""We stopped, got out and found a lady trapped in her car ...... then we noticed flames in the engine bay and the smell of petrol."" Mr. McDermott took a fire extinguisher from the bus, doused the flames, and several other workers controlled traffic. However, he said his actions were ""no big deal"". He was not willing to take any credit for helping the woman. ""The praise goes to all the guys that jumped off that bus."" Invercargill Senior Station officer Alan Goldsworthy, who was an officer in charge at the scene, said there was a possibility the car could have burst into flames if Mr. McDermott and the smelter workers had not helped. ""They should acquire a good pat on the back."" he said."	['in the afternoon']

I was very excited that I had found such a good little shop.I promised Mr.Hopkins that I would come back soon.""I will tell all my friends about your lovely place,"" I told the shopkeeper. ""Please do not do that, sir"", said Mr.Hopkins.""This is a special place for special people.You must keep this shop a secret."" Then he took my photograph, and handed me the picture straight away. ""That was quick!"" I exclaimed.I looked at the photograph.In the picture I looked proud and excited holding the presents I had bought in Mr.Hopkins' dusty shop. On Christmas Day, my friends and s were delighted with the presents I had bought for them.For weeks, my brother begged me to show him where to find this wonderful little shop.I finally agreed to take him to London to show him. When we arrived in London, we walked along Oxford Street, past the department store and found...nothing.The little shop was no longer there.In its place was an empty space being used as a car park.I checked the area again.There was the music shop, and there was the department store.In between should have been Hopkins and Son, but it wasn't there. As I was staring at the place where the shop should have been, an old policeman came along.""Are you looking for something sir?"" he asked. I turned and said ""I am looking for a little shop called Hopkins and Son.I thought it was here."" ""Oh yes,"" said the policeman.""There was a shop here once called Hopkins and Son.It sold all sorts of things, but it was knocked down over 30 years ago."" I looked again at the place where the shop had been.Then I reached into my pocket and took out the photograph that Mr.Hopkins had taken of me holding my presents in the little shop.

What's the right relation between SWISS,Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines?	"Swiss International Air lines(SWISS)will introduce daily non-stop flights between Beijing and Zurich. The new service to the financial center of Switzerland is expected to start on Dec.12,2012,which marks an expansion of services for the Chinese market.In May 2008,SWISS already started direct flights to Shanghai. The first flight to Europe has a special price of 2,680 yuan,which does not include taxes and fuel surcharges. ""I am delighted the airlines of Switzerland can contribute to growing economic ties between the two countries with new daily flights scheduled,""says SWISS CEO Harry Hohmeister. ""We are witnessing a growing demand for tourist travel in both directions."" Apart from Shanghai and Hong Kong,Beijing will be the third Chinese destination for SWISS. The new route marks a return to Beijing for SWISS:the airlines previously flew to the Chinese capital as late as June 2003. SWISS will initially operate its new daily non-stop Beijing-Zurich flights with an Airbus A340-300(219 seats)and Airbu: A330-300(236 seats)air-crafts. The modem SWISS business class offers the most suitable comforts since the seats can be adjusted into a two-meter-long bed. Seating firmness and softness can be adjusted thanks to air cushions. With the introduction of the new SWISS service from Beijing,the Lufthansa Group Airlines may attract more Chinese customers when traveling to Europe. SWISS.Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines already connect five Chinese cities with Europe and beyond. This airlines group is the leading European airlines network in the Chinese market. In the summer of 2011,the Lufthansa Group operated 78 weekly flights from China including Hong Kong to Europe. SWISS is part of the Lufthansa Group as well as a member of the Star Alliance,the world's biggest airlines grouping."	['Austrian Airlines is a part of SWISS.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"Just as the English language has changed quickly in the previous century, so has the use of it. After the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was founded in 1927, the particular style of speech of the BBC announcers was recognized as standard English or Received Pronunciation (RP) English. Now, most people still consider that the pronunciation and delivery of BBC announcers is the clearest and most understandable spoken English. English has had a strong relationship with classes and social positions. However, since the Second World War there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery , and marks of class distinction such as styles of speech have been gradually diminishing, especially in the younger generation. By the end of the 1960s, it had become clear that it was not necessary to speak standard English or even correct grammar to become popular, successful and rich. The fashionable speech of the day was no longer the special right of a special class but rather a defiant expression of classlessness. The greatest single influence of the shaping of the English language in modern times is the American English. Over the last 25 years the English used by many people, particularly by those in the media, advertising and show business, has become more and more mid-Atlantic in style, delivery and accent. In the 1970s, fashion favored careless pronunciation and a language full of jargon, slang and ""in"" words, a great quantity of which couldn't be understood by the outside world. What is considered modern and fashionable in Britain today is often not the kind of English taught in schools and colleges."

Wu Yuan started to cut her finger with a knife because _ .	A recent report from Fuzhou Daily says about 18% of Fuzhou teenagers can have problems with their minds(,).Some students become worried because they have to study very hard. Others have trouble getting on well with people like their parents and classmates. Zhang Qiong, a junior 2 student from Fuzhou, could not understand his teachers in class and was doing badly in his lessons. He was afraid of exams. When he looked at the exam paper, he couldn't think of anything to write. Another student, a15-year-old girl called Wu Yuan from Xiamen often argued ( ) with herclassmates even her parents because of some difficult ideas. She became so angry with them that she started to cut her finger with a knife. However, many students who have problems won't go for advice or help. Some think they will look stupid if they go to see a doctor. Others don't want to talk about their secrets. here is some advice for the teenagers to solve the problems: Firstly, talk to your parents or teachers often. Secondly, take part in group activities and do sports. Thirdly, go to see a doctor if you feel unhappy or unwell.	"[""She couldn't get on well with her classmates even her parents""]"

""Don't worry, kid. In five minutes you won't smell a thing."" said her father. Everybody there was working hard, and they seemed to have a good time. Jodie's father handed her a pair of gloves and told her to get the little plastic bags and throw them into the truck. It was fun, but also hard work. Jodie's arms soon got tired. At last, no more garbage was left and Jodie felt very happy. ""Garbage is disgusting , but when we clear it away, everything's nice and clean. You can make yourself happy only by making others happy. That's why I like being a garbage man so much."" Jodie gave her dirty, smelly garbage man daddy a big kiss, She said, ""When I grow up, I will be a garbage girl!""

"What do students do in""City-as-School""most of the time?"	"Now, there is a new-type school in New York, which has no everyday lessons, no class teachers and even no school buildings. It is called ""City-as-School"". The name just means the city itself is the place where students learn their lessons. They are from the age of 15 to 18. The students choose areas of work which interest them. Then they help to do that work. One girl spends her week in a government office helping the public with problems like housing. Then she goes to help in a theatre for a day and she spends a week for first-year courses at college. Well, students have to pass Maths and science exams before they enter the ""school"". These subjects are not easy to provide in""City-as-School"". Teachers watch the progress of the students. The success rate is high. 80% of the students go to college after the ""City-as-School"". The students like the duty of their work. They have the sense of purpose. They know a lot about different kinds of work in the city. One of the students, Lizette Martinez, writes "" I want to say that I do not know where I would be right now if I had never become part of City-as-School. Leaving my regular high school and going to City-as-School was the best decision I have ever made. The way the school works to get you to go out there and learn different fields instead of sitting in a classroom is wonderful. For all those who are in between school and dropping out, go to CAS and it will change your life forever."" City-as-School High School is the nation's leading external learning or experiential learning model for high school students."	['They help with work in a certain area.']

When the villagers found the hippos, they _ .	"When Regis Mngwiro and the other villagers moved to a new place in southeastern Zimbabwe, Africa, they were happy to find a lake nearby. Now, they would no longer have to walk long distances looking for water. At last, they had a source of water what they call their own. But several days later, two young boys saw something they had never seen before--a huge animal was standing at the edge of the lake, eating grass. When the animal saw the boys, it walked into the lake and disappeared beneath the water. Regis looked into the story of the big creature that vanished into to the lake. ""When I took a closer look at the dung , I realized that it was from a hippo ,"" he said. Twelve hippos were living in the lake. The villagers were worried. In the countrry of Zimbabwe, hippos attack humans more often than lions do. The hippos would often stay on the village side of the lake all day. This meant that the villagers could not go near the lake until the hippos got out. It was too long a wait for the villagers, because they needed the water from the lake to survive . ""This is the only source of fresh water in the village,"" said a villager. ""There is no way we can avoid this lake."" So the women began moving in groups whenever they went to get water from the lake. Before collecting water, they made sure no hippos were nearby. The men began fishing in pairs, with one man always looking out for hippos. It took time, but these days, the hippos and humans live side by side. The villagers say that when the hippos find people coming, they swim slowly to the other side of the lake and mind their own business. The villagers do not go into the part of the lake where the hippos usually stay. They have learned to share the lake they both need to survive."	['became careful when they went near the lake']
What might be the best title for the text?	Bernstein had been appointed Assistant Conductor for the New York philharmonic only a few months before that night. Just 25 years old, he was ly inexperienced. At the last minute, Bernstein was told he was to take Walter's place, so he didn't have any time to rehearse . The music he was going to conduct was very difficult. Plus, the concert was going to be broadcast nationally on the radio. Despite all these pressures, Bernstein rose to the occasion and received a standing ovation at the end of the concert. The event made national headlines, and Bernstein became famous overnight. Some people feel they do their best under the most stressful circumstances. What was it about Leonard Bernstein that made him do so well in such a difficult situation? Perhaps Leonard Bernstein did so well because music was his devotion. The son of a man who supplied hairdressing products, Bernstein became interested in music at the age of 10. By the time he was a teenager, he was performing in public. He became a soloist of the Boston Public School Orchestra, and for 13 weeks in 1934, he played classics on the radio.

The streets where they found her had been her home for many years. Her parents were unknown. They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else--to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began working as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. ""My English just wasn't good enough."" She says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management at Hong Kong and graduated in 1980, She started her own business in 1985. But she did not stop developing herself. She then studied at the University of Hong Kong. Since 1987, she had spent a lot of time on photography. She has held several exhibitions of her work in many places---China, New Zealand and Paris. She still found time, however, to work on TV, write for newspapers and bring up her family.

UNESCO encourages all the following EXCEPT _ of cultural and natural heritage around the world.	Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration. Places as unique and diverse as the wilds of East Africa's Serengeti, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Baroque cathedrals of Latin America make up our world's heritage. What makes the concept of World Heritage exceptional is its universal application. World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world, regardless of the territory on which they are located. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. UNESCO's World Heritage mission is to: encourage countries to sign the World Heritage Convention and to ensure the protection of their natural and cultural heritage; encourage States Parties to the Convention to nominate sites within their national territory for inclusion on the World Heritage List; encourage States Parties to establish management plans and set up reporting systems on the state of conservation of their World Heritage sites; help States Parties safeguard World Heritage properties by providing technical assistance and professional training; provide emergency assistance for World Heritage sites in immediate danger; support States Parties' public awareness-building activities for World Heritage conservation; encourage participation of the local population in the preservation of their cultural and natural heritage; encourage international cooperation in the conservation of our world's cultural and natural heritage.

Which of the following statements is NOT true about Albrecht Durer?	"Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children.In spite of the hopeless condition, two of the children, Albrecht Durer and Albert, had a dream.They both wanted to pursue their talent for art.After many long discussions, the two boys finally worked out an agreement.They would toss a coin.The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother who attended the academy.Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy. Tossing a coin, Albrecht Durer won and went off to Nuremberg.Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, supported his brother, _ work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation .By the time he graduated, he had earned considerable fees for his outstanding works. When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner to celebrate Albrecht's triumphant homecoming.Albrecht drank a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled him to complete his dream.""And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn.Now you can go to Nuremberg to look for your dream, and I will take care of you."" Tears streaming down his pale face, Albert sobbed, ""No...no...It is too late for me.Look...look at what four years in the mines have done to my hands!The bones in every finger have been broken at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less draw delicate lines with a pen or a brush."" To show thanks to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother's injured hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward.He called his powerful drawing simply ""Hands"", but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed it ""The Praying Hands"".The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, let it be your reminder--no one ever makes any success alone!"

What does the passage mainly talk about?	"When we're little, our mother is the center of our attention, and we are the center of hers. So our mother's characteristics leave an indelible impression, and we are forever after attracted to people with her facial features, body type, personality, even sense of humor. If our mother is warm and giving, as adults we tend to be attracted to people who are warm and giving. If our mother is strong and even-tempered, we are going to be attracted to a fair-minded strength in our mates. The mother has an additional influence on her sons: she not only gives them clues to what they will find attractive in a mate, but also affects how they feel about women in general. So if she is warm and nice, her sons are going to think that's the way women are. They will probably grow up to be warm and responsive lovers and also be cooperative around the house. Conversely, a mother who has a depressive personality, and is sometimes friendly but then suddenly turns cold and rejecting, may raise a man who becomes a ""dance-away lover"". Because he's been so scared about love from his mother, he's afraid of commitment and may pull away from a girlfriend for this reason. While the mother determines in large part what qualities attract us in a mate, it's the father--the first male in our lives--who influences how we relate to the opposite sex. Fathers have an enormous effect on their children's personalities and chances of marital happiness. Just as mothers influence their son's general feelings toward women, fathers influence their daughter's general feelings about men. If a father _ praise on his daughter and demonstrates that she is a worthwhile person, she'll feel very good about herself in relation to men. But if the father is cold, critical or absent, the daughter will tend to feel she's not very lovable or attractive. In addition, most of us grow up with people of similar social circumstances. We hang around with people in the same town; our friends have about the same educational backgrounds and career goals. We tend to be most comfortable with these people, and therefore we tend to link up with others whose families are often much like our own."	"[""Parents' influence on their children.""]"
This passage implies that _ . .	Everyone has heard of the San Andreas fault , which constantly threatens California and the West Coast with earthquakes. But how many people know about the equally serious New Madrid fault in Missouri? Between December of 1811 and February of 1812, three major earthquakes occurred, all centered around the town of New Madrid, Missouri, on the Mississippi River. Property damage was severe. Buildings in the area were almost destroyed. Whole forests fell at once, and huge cracks opened in the ground, releasing some strong smell chemicals. The Mississippi River itself completely changed character, developing sudden rapids and whirlpools . Several times it changed its course, and once, according to some observers, it actually appeared to run backwards. Few people were killed in the New Marid earthquakes, probably simply because few people lived in the area in 1811; but the severity of the earthquakes are shown by the fact that the shock waves rang bells in church towers in Charleston, South Carolina, on the coast. Buildings shook in New York City, and clocks were stopped in Washington, D.C. Scientists now know that America's two major faults are essentially different. The San Andreas is a horizontal boundary between two major land masses that are slowly moving in opposite directions. California earthquakes result when the two masses make a sudden move. The New Madrid fault, on the other hand, is a vertical fault; at some points, possibly hundreds of millions of years ago, rock was pushed up toward the surface, probably by volcanoes under the surface. Suddenly, the volcanoes cooled and the rock collapsed, leaving huge cracks. Even now, the rock continues to settle downwards, and sudden sinking motions cause earthquakes in the region. The fault itself, a large crack in this layer of rock, with dozens of other cracks that split off from it, extends from northeast Arkansas through Missouri and into southern Illinois. Scientists who have studied the New Madrid fault say there have been numerous smaller quakes in the area since 1811; these smaller quakes indicate that larger ones are probably coming, but the scientists say they have no method of predicting when a large earthquake will occur.

After reading the whole passage, we can know that the passage is written in a(n) _ tone.	One cold morning in winter, I went alone to a hillside to do some hunting. I sat there waiting for about an hour. Suddenly, a big beautiful deer appeared less than 20 feet away from me. There was no cover near him. Surely I could shoot him. To my surprise, he came toward me! He was curious, I suppose, or maybe he was stupid. For this was not a youngster, but a fully grown-up one. He must have known about men and their guns. But this deer came closer, and I still waited. His big eyes never moved away from my face. His wonderful head with a set of antlers was clear in sight. I was getting a bit nervous as he walked closer. A big deer can do a lot of damage. Well, he walked right up to where I was sitting. Then he stopped and looked at me. What happened next was hard to believe. But it all seemed quite natural. I held out my hands and scratched his head right between the antlers. And he liked it. The big, wild, beautiful deer bent his head. I scratched and touched his head and body. His nose touched my shoulder. I fed him with my last sandwich. Well, he finally went his way, down the hill. Shoot him? Not me. You wouldn't, either. Not after that. I just watched him go, a strong deer carrying a proud head. I picked up my gun, and started walking back. Suddenly, I heard two shots, one after another. If you have hunted much, you will know what two shots mean. They mean a kill. I had forgotten that there were other hunters around. You will now understand why I gave up hunting from that day on.	['sad']

The lifestyle of French people can be considered as _ .	"I was going to Paris, which I'd always wanted to see. But now I was frightened to travel alone. I arrived at the train station in Paris. I hadn't spoken my college French for twenty years. On my first metro ride, I came across an incompetent thief. I just stared at him, and he stopped his hand from my purse and disappeared into the crowd. Somewhere in this confusing city was my hotel hidden, but the directions suddenly weren't easy to find. When I finally found the hotel, my heart was beating heavily, and I was sweating like a basketball player. I couldn't stay. Could I? The wallpaper looked like it had been through a fire. The bathroom was downstairs, and the window looked out onto the brick wall of another building. Welcome to Paris. I sincerely wanted to die. I missed my friends. I was entering my third week away from home and my kids, and I had arrived in the most romantic city in the world, alone, lonely and frightened. The most important thing I did in Paris happened at that moment. I knew that if I didn't go out, right then, and find a place to have dinner, I would hide in this small room my entire time in Paris. I might never learn to enjoy the world as a single individual. So I went out. Evening in Paris was light and pleasant. I walked along a path, listening to birds sing, watching children float toy boats in a huge fountain. No one seemed to be in a hurry. Paris was beautiful. And I was here alone and suddenly not lonely. My sense of accomplishment overcoming my fear and weakness had left me feeling free. I wore out two pairs of shoes during my week's stay in Paris. I did everything there was to do, and it was the greatest week of my European vacation. I returned home, becoming a believer in the power of traveling alone. Now when I meet difficulties I just say to myself, ""If I can go to Paris, I can go anywhere."""	['relaxed']
According to Brandy Gabrielle, what can we know about old parents?	"Psychiatrists who work with older parents say that maturity can be an advantage in child raising--older parents are more thoughtful, use less physical discipline and spend more time with their children. But raising kids takes money and energy. Many older parents find themselves balancing their limited financial resources, decreasing energy and failing health against the growing demands of an active child. Dying and leaving young children is probably the older parents' biggest, and often unspoken fear. ""Having late-life children often means parents, particularly fathers, end up retiring much later. For many, retirement becomes an unobtainable dream."" says Brandy Gabrielle, an economics professor. Henry Metcalf, a 54-year-old journalist, knows it takes money to raise kids. But he's also worried that his energy will give out first. Sure, he can still ride bikes with his athletic fifth grader, but he's learned that young at heart doesn't mean young. Lately he's been taking afternoon naps to keep up his energy. ""My body is aging,"" says Metcalf. ""You can't get away from that."" Often, older parents hear the ticking of another kind of biological clock. Therapists who work with middle-aged and older parents say fears about aging are nothing to laugh at. ""They worry they'll be mistaken for grandparents, or that they'll need help getting up out of those little chairs in nursery school,"" says Joann Gals, a New York psychologist. But at the core of those little fears there is often a much bigger one: ""that they won't be alive long enough to support and protect their children,"" she says. Many late-life parents, though, say their children came at just the right time. After marrying late and undergoing years of pregnancy treatment, Marilyn Nolen and her husband, Randy, had twins. ""We both wanted children,"" says Marilyn, who was 55 when she gave birth. The twins have given the couple what they desired for years -- a sense of family. Kids of older dads are often smarter, happier and more sociable because their fathers are more involved in their lives. ""The dads are older, more mature,"" says Dr. Silber, ""and more ready to focus on parenting."""	['They have to go on working beyond their retirement age.']
The economics of the world need to grow to _ .	Most people want to work, but in today's word ,it is more difficult to find work for everybody.The economics of the world need to grow by 4% each year just to keep the old number of jobs for people. Often this is not possible,and so more people are out of work. Some people have no jobs now because new machines can do the work of many people do in a short time.Also, machines do not ask for more money and longer holidays. In all the countries of the world, machines are taking work from people ,not only in factories but also on the farms. One machine can often do the work of forty people. About 75,000 people are moving to the cities a day to look for jobs ,but only 70% of them can find jobs .	['keep the old number of jobs of people']
Betty: I know that it's not right to speak fast. But I am afraid that I can't finish my talk in the given time if I speak slowly.	Read the suggestions for making an English speech. a. Looking at and talking to one person in the audience helps keep you natural, but it feels foolish talking to only one person. Speak to that person as long as 15 seconds and then change another one. b. The audience have a hard time understanding what they hear. They need your help. Slow down, pause and guide the audience through your talk. Remember that you should help the audience understand what you are saying. c. Make your voice a little lower than normal. Listeners like to listen to a relatively deep voice. d. When you talk, try to be as natural as possible. Don't try to memorize your words and read or recite them to your audience. You can use short notes to help you remember the important points. e. You should know you and most of the people you talk to are different in many ways. Some of them may not know what you are talking about. Then speak to them on their terms and in their languages. f. Concentrate on what you want to say. If you are always paying attention to gestures ,you will feel uncomfortable. g. It's true that there are some differences between American English and British English, but they'll not cause much difficulty for listeners, so just speak the way you're used to. Choose a suggestion for each of the following students according to their problems.	['b']
Which of the following is the main factor of a successful performance?	"You are watching a film in which two men are having a fight. They hit one another hard. At the start they only fight with their fists .But soon they begin hitting one another over the heads with chairs. And so it goes on until one of the men crashes through a window and falls thirty feet to the ground below. He is dead! Of course he isn't really dead. With any luck he isn't even hurt. Why ? Because the men who fall out of high windows or jump from fast moving trains, who crash cars of even catching fire, are professionals .They do this for a living. These men are called stuntmen. That is to say, they perform tricks . There are two sides to their work. They actually do most of the things you see on the screen. For example, they fall from a high building. However, they do not fall on to hard ground but on to empty cardboard boxes covered with a mattress . Again, when they hit one another with chairs, the chairs are made of soft wood and when they crash through windows, the glass is made of sugar! But although their work depend on trick of this sort, it also requires a high degree of skill and training. Often a stuntman's success depends on careful timing .For example, when he is ""blown up"" in a battle scene, he has to jump out of the way of the explosion just at the right moment. Naturally stuntmen are well paid for their work, but they lead dangerous lives. They often get seriously injured, and sometimes killed. A Norwegian stuntman, for example, skied over the edge of a cliff a thousand feet high. His parachute failed to open, and he was killed. In spite of all the risks, this is no longer a profession for men only. Men no longer dress up as women when actresses have to perform some dangerous action. For nowadays there are stuntgirls too!"

Why did the teachers start the Read and Ride program?	"Sitting at a desk in a classroom all day can be pretty boring. The teachers at Ward Elementary in Winston -Salem,North Carolina ,picked up on that and traded in their students' desks for exercise bikes as a part of their Read and Ride program! The Read and Ride program began five years ago.One classroom has enough bikes for every student in any given class,and throughout the day teachers bring in their students to the room to ride them and read their books. Even regular classrooms have one bike in the back of each room for students who just can't sit still to use to help them burn energy in a good way. Students love being more active! Teachers enjoy seeing students eager to read.Parents appreciate stronger,smarter children.Headmasters value this effective and cost-free program.""Riding exercise bikes makes reading fun for many kids who get frustrated when they read.Thus,they have a way to release that frustration while they ride,""said Scott Ertl,who started the program.""As we can see,everyone wants to promote literacy and lose weight! But many students who are overweight struggle with sports and activities since they don't want to always be the last or lose with others watching on the playground.On exercise bikes,however,students are able to exert themselves at their own level--without anyone noticing when they slow down or take a break."" As it turns out,not only are the bikes helping the students burn calories,they're also helping them learn better and stay focused.At the end of the school year the school analyzed testing data and found that students that spent more time reading and riding did more than twice as well on reading tests than their fellow students who spent the least time in the program."

The writer suggests that _ .	"The iPhone, the iPad, each of Apple's products sounds cool and has become a fad . Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter ""i"" - and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer - which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear - popular in the US and UK - that plays music and video is called ""iTeddy"". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name ""i"". In general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use. Most ""i"" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's ""i"", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name. But it's hard to see what's so special about the letter ""i"". Why not use ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, ""i"" works because its meaning has become _ When Apple uses ""i"", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. ""Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,"" he says. ""However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability .""adds Thorne. Clearly the letter ""i"" also agrees with the idea that the Western World is centered on the individual. Each person believes they have their own needs, and we love personalized products for this reason. Along with ""Google"" and ""blog"", readers of BBC Magazines voted ""i"" as one of the top 20 words that have come to define the last decade. But as history shows, people grow tired of fads. From the 1900s to 1990s, products with ""2000"" in their names became fashionable as the year was associated with all things advanced and modern. However, as we entered the new century, the trend inevitably disappeared."	"['the popularity of ""i"" products may not last long']"

What does the passage mainly tell us?	Harriet Tubman was an AfricanAmerican woman who fought against slavery. She was born in 1820. She helped many people escape from slavery through the Underground Railroad. It was an organized effort to help slaves from the southern states to areas that banned slavery. Slaves could be sold freely. Families were often separated. Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman in 1844, yet she remained a slave. In 1849, the farmer who owned her died. Then she ran to the home of a white woman who had offered to help her. This woman told her how to reach another home where she could hide. Harriet Tubman went from place to place in this way. This was how the Underground Railroad operated. Finally,she went into the northern state of Pennsylvania. During the next ten years,she led an expanded Underground Railroad,and helped 300 slaves escape. Harriet Tubman found another way to fight against slavery during the Civil War. She went into the southern states to spy for the North. After the Civil War,Harriet Tubman settled in New York State. She gave speeches to raise money for better education for black Americans, worked for women's rights and sought help for older adults who had been slaves. Harriet Tubman died in 1913.By that time, she had been recognized as an American heroine .	"[""Harriet's fight against slavery.""]"
Children feel it hard for them to go upstairs because _ .	"Are you carrying too much on your back to school? I'm sure lots of your age will say ""Yes"". Not only the students in China have this problem, but children in the United States also have heavy school bags. Doctors are starting to worry about that younger and younger students are having problems as a result of school bags being too heavy for them. ""It's hard for me to go upstairs with my bag because it's so heavy,"" said Rich Hammond, an 11-year-old student in the US. Rich is among students who have common school bags with two straps to carry them, but many other choose rolling bags. But even with rolling bags, getting up stairs and houses is still a problem for children. Many of them have hurt backs and necks because of the heavy school bags. But how much is too much? Doctors say students should carry no more than 10% to 15% of their own body weight. Scott Bautch, a black doctor, said children under Grade 4 should stay with 10%. But it is also important that older children don't stay with over 15%, because their bodies are still growing. ""Children are losing their balance and falling down with their school bags,"" he said. Parents and teachers are starting to tell children to only take home library books that they will be reading at night. Some teachers are using pieces of paper or thin workbooks for students to take home. One of the best answers is, as some children said, to have no homework at all."

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"From my father I have learned a lot. And I'm very thankful to him. I remember when I was a child my father always got up very early, quietly putting on his clothes and going off to work. To arrive in time to open his tiny store at 8:30, he needed to leave our apartment at 6:30. After all, he had to take a bus and then the subway. The last journey was a long walk through a neighborhood much of which was full of the smell of rubbish. I learned: it is very important to work. No excuse. When I was 12, I would, on some Saturdays, go to my father's store to help out. After helping set up the outside clothing display, for the rest of the day, I'd watch to make sure no one stole anything. When I noticed someone looking unusual or strange, I would look the person in the eye, smile and say, ""May I help you?"" Usually that worked, but sometimes, someone would run off with something. The first time, I ran after the thief but my father shouted, ""Martin, stop! There is no need to do that."" It's true that safety is more important than money. After 10 years of hard work, he saved up enough money to buy his first car, a cheap one--he wouldn't buy one until he could afford to pay for it without borrowing money. I learned: buy only what you can afford. Buying necessary food and clothing won't make us go in debt . The unnecessary things won't give us happiness, which comes from achievement only."

"Who made the family have the idea of living ""in 1982""?"	"A family in Guelph, Ontario is spending a year living ""in 1982"". They're doing it so their kids can see what life was like before technology like iPads, computers and even coffee machines was part of everyday life. They have stopped using all technology from their home and are relying on the things people would have used back in the 80s. There is a box at the front door where people can put their cell phones in, while they're visiting the family. Blair McMillan and his wife Morgan want their kids--Trey, 5, and Denton, 2--to have a year without technology. Instead of reading e-readers, they are reading books. Instead of using a GPS, they used paper maps. The home the family is living in was built in the 1980s. Even the way they dress and style their hair is from the 80s. The whole idea started when young Trey was called to come outside. He didn't because he was busy playing on the ipad. That's why his dad thought of the idea of living ""in 1982"" for a year. The family plans to live like ""it's 1982"" until April next year. To them, one of the hardest things was giving up their cell phone."	['Young Trey.']
How can you save time during your trip in La Lucciola according to the text?	"Bali is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. Here's how to get the most out of a 48hour visit: FRIDAY 3pm--There's nothing like a good meal. La Lucciola is the place to go, with its good food, great service and a beautiful view of the sea. You can hire a car for some 450,000 rupiah per day. This will help you have more to spare during your trip there. 5pm--About an hour away from La Lucciola is Uluwatu. This southern tip of the island is famous for its temple that lies on the edge, high above the sea. Fire dance is performed here daily at sunset. 8pm--To finish off the evening, head to Jimbaran Bay where restaurants offer candles, dances, boys singing songs. Kick off your shoes, feel the sand, and enjoy the night. SATURDAY 9:30am--Start the day with another taste of culture by heading for a ""barong and keris"" dance performance. It's held in many places. One is the Catur Eka Budi in Denpasar, capital of Bali. 12pm--About 50km from Denpasar is Kintamani, a favorite with tourists for the view of active volcano Mt. Batur. It's a good idea to reach Kintamani early as it gets cloudy after 3pm. Have lunch at a local restaurant with a view of Mt. Batur. Tourists can climb to Mt. Batur to catch the sunrise. 6:30pm--Spa time! Spa Hati is a good place. Book ahead. SUNDAY 6am--It's time to go to the sea. Don't forget the camera. 10:30am--Another halfday trip to two of the most famous temples in Bali. Drive down to the Taman Ayun temple at Mengwi. 12am--Next up is the Tanah Lot temple, perhaps the most famous of them all. Built on a rock, it's best seen in the afternoon when it's against the sun or at sunset."	['Hiring a car.']
Carol Carter's words implied that _ .	"Where have all the boys gone?You may be able to find them in the gym, at work or hanging out, but there's where boys are underrepresented, and the problem seems to be getting worse. These days, at high school graduation ceremonies, there are a lot more girls than boys. In fact, every year, 10 percent more girls graduate from high school than boys. ""I think that there's a tendency to focus on boys as problems at this point, rather than recognize that boys have problems,"" says Joanne Max, PhD. Experts say the problems start in grade school, where there's often an emphasis on sports instead of reading, for example. ""I think that with boys there's some idea that it's not masculine to read,"" says Rob Jenkins, an English professor. There's also a shortage of male teachers as role models. ""I think boys need role models, so if you're a boy and you don't have a dad in your home and then you have one male teacher and it's your athletic coach then I don't think you have a message that education is very important,"" says Carol Carter, another expert. In addition, classrooms often have too little activity and too much passive listening, which is not conducive to boys' learning. Experts say parents can fight back in many ways. Read to your sons early and often; show by your actions that you value their education. Ask them about their schoolwork, offer help, drop by their classroom and finally, appeal to their competitive spirit: challenge them to do better and help them understand that their future depends on it."

Ray was regarded as a savior because _ .	"He is a lesson to every boy who ever picked up a basketball and dreamed that it would change his life. The lights were never brighter and the crowds were never bigger for a homegrown sports hero than they were a quarter-century ago for Ray Hall. But his athletic achievements, as impressive as they are, are to my mind not what is most admirable about the man. Known as ""Sugar Ray"" in his teens, Hall was rated among the country's top 25 high school basketball players. An inner-city kid from a solid family, Hall took on the challenge of lifting Canisius College -- still recovering from its failure -- back to respectability, rejecting more favorable offers. His status of a savior brought more pressure than any 18-year-old should have to handle. However, I watched him mature into the player who led Canisius back to daylight. After college Hall played professionally in Italy and Greece for over 10 years until a car accident at 32 ended his basketball career. The news that he would never play again shocked Hall but unlike so many others he was ready for life after basketball. When I met Hall -- still fit at 46 -- for lunch Monday, he wore a cut-sharp gray suit, designer tie and blazing white shirt that screamed Success. ""That was always the question -- when the cheers end, where do you go? Who do you turn to?"" he said. ""It starts and ends with that person in the mirror."" Hall got the concept of academics-first from his parents. He graduated from Canisius a semester early. ""No matter how good of an athlete you are, you are just one injury away from losing it all,"" he said. ""But if you take care of things academically, you are prepared until you leave this earth."" For the past 14 years, he has been in a computer sales job at Ingram Micro. He married his college sweetheart. They have three kids and a nice house in the suburbs. He figured out early what others learn too late: Athletics is part of a journey, not the destination. Congratulations, Ray, you made it. In more ways than one."

According to researchers' study, most high school students drop out of school because _ .	"A survey suggests that people who have dropped out from high school just earn an average of $9,000 less per year than graduates. Now a new study removes a common belief why they quit. It's much more basic than flunking out . Society tends to think of high school dropouts as kids who just can't cut it. They are lazy, and perhaps not too bright. So researchers were surprised when they asked more than 450 kids who quit school about why they left. ""The vast majority actually had passing grades and they were confident that they could have graduated from high school."" John Bridgeland, the executive researcher said. About one million teens leave school each year. Only about half of African-American and Hispanic students will receive a diploma , and actually all dropouts come to regret their decision. So, if failing grades don't explain why these kids quit, what does? Again, John Bridgeland: ""The most dependable finding was that they were bored."" ""They found classes uninteresting; they weren't inspired or motivated. They didn't see any direct connection between what they were learning in the classroom to their own lives, or to their career aspirations."" The study found that most teens who do drop out wait until they turn sixteen, which happens to be the age at which most states allow students to quit. In the U.S., only one state, New Mexico, has a law requiring teenagers to stay in high school until they graduate. Only four states: California, Tennessee, Texas and Utah, plus the District of Columbia, require school attendance until age 18, no exceptions. Jeffrey Grin, another researcher, says raising the compulsory attendance age may be one way to keep more kids in school. ""As these dropouts look back, they realize they've made a mistake. And anything that sort of gives these people an extra push to stick it out and see it through to the end, is probably helpful measure."" New Hampshire may be the next state to raise its school attendance age to 18. But critics say that forcing the students unwilling to continue their studies to stay in school misses the point--the need for reform. It's been called for to reinvent high school education to make it more challenging and relevant, and to ensure that kids who do stick it out receive a diploma that actually means something."

What made it take so long a time to find the missing Airbus?	"It was a sunny holiday Monday. Olivier Ferrante was cooking sausages on the barbecue and entertaining friends in his garden north of Paris when the phone rang. The call came from the BEA, France's air accidents investigation bureau , where the 38-year-old former football player and driver was an investigator. The news was grim. ""An Airbus is missing over the Atlantic: we need you."" As a safety investigator,Ferrante and his teams had participated, directly and indirectly,in the recovery of crashed planes from the Red Sea, the Black Sea,and every ocean. But this investigation would be his toughest ever: the plane had disappeared without a witness, or a trace on radar . At least eight ships and a dozen military aircraft gathered on the plane's last known position, about halfway between Brazil and Western Africa. After six days the aircraft's tail fin and 50 bodies were spotted on the surface and the first burning questions were answered. The plane wreckage and passenger injuries indicated the doomed Airbus was unbroken when it hit the water. It was not exploded apart by a bomb or lightning, now broken up by violent weather. Strangely, no mayday message had been sent by its pilots. Ferrante worked energetically with his team:collecting offers of help from around the world, consulting navy ministries and research organizations in France and elsewhere, and contracting suitable ships and high-tech equipment. He would not return home for another 29 days. His team used the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV) operated around the clock, searching about 400 square kilometers a day. But the race against time was lost and no signals were heard and no more wreckage was found. Day after day, the screen remained bare except for objects that turned out to be stones or garbage from ships. Stressed by media attention and painful meetings with victims' s,Ferrante went jogging one day to clear his head. Then he had an idea. He decided to look at what had happened to nine other planes that crashed after something abruptly went wrong while flying at high altitude. He found that none had traveled more than 30 km before hitting the sea; most covered less than half that distance. AUV operations continued but now they focused on a 30 km circle around the plane's last known position. On the ninth day of the new-strategy searching, after searching for 22 months, their hard work paid off finally. The first thing they saw was a woman's handbag. Next,they saw bits of twisted aircraft parts and a panel with ""AF"" painted on it. Without a doubt,this was the missing Aribus,lying 11 km northeast of its last known position, but nobody felt much like cheering the discovery. ""The screen also exposed well-preserved human bodies,and for some of us they were hard to look at,"" says Ferrante."	['The strategy used in the first stage of the search was not effective.']

From the passage we can learn that _ .	Teachers' Day is, interestingly, not celebrated on the same day all over the world. In some countries it is marked by a holiday, in others it is a working day. International Teachers' Day is celebrated on October 5. Being held ever since 1994, it is in honor of teachers' organizations worldwide. Its aim is to encourage supports for teachers and to meet the needs of students. China--In 1939, Teachers' Day was set for August 27, Confucius' birthday. In1951, the celebration was stopped. However, it was founded again in 1985, and the day was changed to September 10. India--Teachers' Day is celebrated on September 5 in honour of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second president of India, whose birthday falls on that day. Russia--In Russia, Teachers' Day was celebrated on the first Sunday of October between 1965 and 1994. Since 1994, the day is _ on October 5, just the same day as World Teachers' Day. The US--In the US, Teachers' Day is non-official holiday. It is celebrated on the Tuesday of the first full week of May. A number of activities are organized in schools to honor teachers. The celebrations can continue for the whole week of May. Thailand--In Thailand, National Teachers' Day is celebrated every year on January 16. The first Teachers' Day was held in 1957. The day is a holiday in schools.	"[""International Teachers' Day aims to benefit the students.""]"
In the early history of America and Australia, both colonies developed towards the west firstly for her reaon that _ .	Australia, the last continent, was discovered by ships belonging to some European nations in the seventeenth century. These nations were less interested in changing it into a colony than in exploring it. As in the early history of the United States, it was the English who set up the settlements in Australia. This history and the geography of these two British colonies have some other things in common as well. Australia and the United States are about the same in size, and their western lands are both not rich in soil. It was the eastern coast of Australia and American that the English first settled, and both colonies soon began to develop towards the west. However, this westward movement took place more because the English were searching for better land than because the population was increasing. Settlements of the western part of both countries developed quickly after gold was discovered in America in 1849 and in Australia two years later. Although the development of these two countries has a lot in common, there are some striking differences as well. The United States gained its independence from England by revolution while Australis won its independence without having to go to war. Australia, unlike the United States, was firstly truned into a colony by English prisoners and its economic development was in wheat growing and sheep raising. By 1922, for example, Australia had fifteen times more sheep than it had people, or almost half as many sheep as there are people today in the United States. Yet, in spite of these and other main differences, Australia and the United States have more in common with each other than either one has with most of the rest of the world.

What is the passage mainly about?	A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress.

Which is NOT a cause of colds in the reading?	Many cultures have different ideas about why people catch colds. For example in the United States, some people think that you can catch a cold if your feet get cold. So, mothers tell small children to wear warm boots in the winter. In other places, including parts of the Middle East, some people believe that strong winds cause colds. So, on trains and buses, people usually don't like to sit next to open windows. In parts of Europe, some people think that wearing wet clothes will give you a cold. They say that after you go swimming, you should quickly put on dry clothes. Today, scientists know that colds are caused by a virus . But the old ideas are still very strong, and many _ .	['bad food']
"The author said, ""My goodness! Andre ! "" when _ ."	"Shark on the bait !"" shouted Andre Harman, pointing to a spot a few yards behind the outboard motors. His voice gave no indication of panic, but the crew suddenly became tense and fixed their eyes on the water. Slowly, smoothly, Andre drew in the bait.The shark followed. No one asked what kind of shark it was. Everything about it, from its color to its shape, tells that it was a great white shark. Andre lifted the bait aboard. Placing himself between the two motors, he dropped his right hand into the water just as the great head reached the first motor. ""My goodness Andre!"" I said. His hand seized the big nose, moving it away from the tube of the motor, guiding the shark's head up as it rose out of the water. Andre's hand held the nose, touching it gently. No one spoke. No one breathed. The moment seemed endless. In fact, it lasted less than five seconds before Andre pulled his hand back. Still nobody spoke. Then Andre smiled and said: ""The first time was an accident. I was just trying to move the shark away from the motor. Sharks are attracted to motors by their electrical signals and have a habit of biting them to see if they are eatable. "" Andre has worked with great white sharks for years. ""My hand landed on its nose, and it sort of paused, so I kept it there, and when I did let go, the shark bit and bit as if it was searching for whatever it was that had attracted it."" Nearly every encounter we had had with the great whites had been totally illogical. The more we learned, the more we realized how little was really known about them in the past years. Back then, it was generally accepted that great whites ate people by choice. Now we know that almost every attack on a human is an accident in which the shark mistakes a human for its normal food. Back then, we thought that once a great white smelt blood, it would lead to death. Now we know that nearly three-quarters of bite victims survive, perhaps because the shark recognizes that is has made a mistake and doesn't return for a second bite."

The best title for the passage can be _ .	Darling Kelli, I'm so sorry I will not get to see you grow up as I so want to. Please don't blame people or the world for this. A lot of life is simply luck and mine is running out. I wish I had the words to make you feel better. I wish you didn't have to see me in pain as you often do now. I wish so many things were different but they are not. But while your old dad is still around, I thought I'd try to give you some life advice in one go. I hope it gives you some comfort. I hope cancer never returns so that your life is long, fulfilled and happy. Everyone will say it's of great importance to work hard at school. I hope you'll always do your best. I did well at school but did it do me much good in life? Not really. Schoolwork is important, but make sure you have fun too. You and your mom will argue at times, especially when you're a teenager. Please remember she loves you and wants the best for you. Give Mommy a hug when she is feeling sad. When you're a teenager you might think your friends are right and your mom is wrong. But she has to make hard decisions for you. Treat her well. You'll have boyfriends when you're older, so here's some advice. It's very hard to describe how it feels to really be in love. You might remember seeing your mom and I laughing together and cuddling on the sofa, and once the love hearts and flowers fade that's what real love looks like. Have fun finding it. Most important of all: Your laugh takes over your whole body. I hope you never lose that. There is no point in asking you not to be sad when I go. I know you will be, princess. And I wish I could be there to hug you until you smile again. And finally, thank you for being you, Kelli. Enjoy your life. Don't rush through it. All my love, always, goes to you, princess.

This passage suggests that one's hearing _ .	Doctors have known for a long time that extremely loud noises can cause hearing damage or loss. The noise can be the sound of a jet airplane or machines in factories of loud music or other common sound at home and at work. A person only needs to hear the noise for little more than one second to be affected. An American scientist has found that using aspirin increase the temporary hearing loss or damage from loud noise. He did an experiment using a number of students at a university who all had normal hearing. He gave them different amounts of aspirin for different periods of time, then he tested their hearing ability. He found that students who were given four grams of aspirin a day for two days suffered much greater temporary hearing loss than those who did not use aspirin. The hearing loss was about two times as great. The scientist said millions of persons in the U.S. use much larger amounts of aspirin than were used in his experiment. He said these persons face a serious danger of suffering hearing loss from loud noise.	['will be damaged even if he has heard a loud noise for only little more than one second']
The purpose of the passage is to _ .	"As we grow old, we realize that we have so little time to read and there are so many great books that we've yet to get around to. Yet re-readers are everywhere around us. For certain fans, re-reading The Lord of the Rings is a conventional practice annually. One friend told me that Jane Austen's Emma can still surprise him, despite his having read it over 50 times. New sudden clear understandings can be gained from the process of re-reading. Journalist Rebacca Mead, a long-time Englishwoman in New York, first came across George Eliot's Middlemarch at 17. Since then, she has read it again every five years. With each re-reading, it has opened up further; in each chapter of her life, it has resonated differently. Mead evidenced the large number of ways in which really good books not only stand the test of repeat reads, but also offer fresh gifts each time we _ . These kinds of books grow with us. Scientists have also recognized the mental health benefits of re-reading. Research conducted with readers in the US found that on our first reading, we are concerned with the ""what"" and the ""why"". Second time round, we're able to better appreciate the emotions that the plot continues to express. As researcher Cristel Russell of the American University explained, returning to a book ""brings new or renewed appreciation of both the great book and its readers."" It's true that we often find former selves on the pages of old books (if we're fond of making notes on the pages). These texts can carry us back to a time and place, and remind us of the kind of person that we were then. We're changed not only by lived experience but also by read experience - by the books that we've discovered since last reading the one in our hand. More so than the movie director or the musician, the writer calls upon our imaginations, using words to lead us to picture this declaration of love or that unfaithfulness in life. A book is a joint project between writers and readers, and we must pour so much of ourselves into reading that our own life story can become connected with the story in the book. Perhaps what's really strange is that we don't re-read more often. After all, we watch our favorite films again and we wouldn't think of listening to an album only once. We treasure messy old paintings as objects, yet of all art forms, literature alone is a largely one-time delight. A book, of course, takes up more time, but as Mead confirms, the rewards make it adequately worthwhile."	['bring awareness to the significance of re-reading']
People used to think that the rubbish thrown into the sea _ .	About 97% of the world's water is salty and is found in our oceans and seas. But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future. We depend on the oceans for fish which are an important part of the human diet. How important seawater is!	"[""wouldn't do much harm to the sea""]"
According to the passage, what might cause children's inactivity?	"A new study found that inner-city kids living in neighborhoods with more green space gained about 13% less weight over a two-year period than kids living among more concrete and fewer trees. Such findings tell a powerful story. The obesity epidemic began in the 1980s, and many people think it results from increased portion sizes and inactivity , but that can't be everything. Big Macs and TVs have been with us for a long time. ""Most experts agree that the changes were related to something in the environment,"" says Thomas Glass of the Hopkins School of Public Health. That something could be a shrinking of the green. The new research, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, isn't the first to associate greenery with better health, but it does get us closer to identifying what works and why. At its most straightforward, a green neighborhood simply means more places for kids to play -- which is important since time spent outdoors is one of the strongest links to children's activity levels. Glass warns that most studies don't necessarily prove a link between greenness and health, but they're helping _ action. In September the U.S. government approved the No Child Left Inside Act to encourage public initiatives aimed at exposing kids to the outdoors. Finding green space is, of course, not always easy, and you may have to work a bit to get your family a little grass and trees. If you live in a suburb or a city with good parks, take advantage of what's there. Your children in particular will love it -- and their bodies will thank you."	['A shrinking of the green']

What's the main idea of the whole passage?	"Four American college students learned last week that free music downloads can carry a hidden price tag --- US $ 12,000 to $ 17,500, to be exact. Major record companies accused the students of fueling music piracy by running file-sharing networks on campus allowing hundreds of songs to be downloaded for free. Last Thursday, the four promised not to violate the companies' copyrights. Although they did not admit any wrongdoing, they each agreed to pay thousands of dollars to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). ""I don't believe that I did anything wrong,"" said Daniel Peng at prefix = st1 /PrincetonUniversity, one of the four. ""I hope that for the sake of artists, the larger issues can soon be resolved."" None appears to have made any money off the file-sharing systems they operated, which were confined to their campus's computer networks. The payments mark the first time record companies have recovered money from individuals in the USaccused of piracy on file-sharing networks. This may be a sign of things to come, as the industry starts taking its battle against online piracy directly to users. Many record-company executives blame the long slump in CD sales on file-sharing networks, which let users copy songs from each other's computers for free. Matt Oppenheim, senior vice president of business and legal affairs for the RIAA, said the settlements, although well below what the companies could have asked for, were ""the right amount"" given the situation. He also noted that since the four lawsuits were filed, at least 18 campus file-sharing networks have been taken down by their operators."

Which of the following factors isn't helpful to people's health and long life?	"In the Caucasus region of Russia, nearly 50 out of every 100,000 people live to celebrate their 100th birthday, and many don't stop at 100! By comparison, in America only 3 people in 100,000 reach 100. But these Russian old people aren't alone. The Pakistanis, who live high in the Himalaya Mountains, and the Ecuadorans of the Andes Mountains seem to share the secret of long life, too. These people remain healthy in body and spirit despite the passage of time. While many older persons in industrial societies become weak and ill in their 60s and 70s, some Caucasians aged 100 to 140, work in the fields beside their great-great-grandchildren. Even the idea of aging is foreign to them. When asked ""at what age does youth end?""most of these old people had no answer. Several replied, ""Well, perhaps at age 80."" What accounts for this ability to survive to such old age, and to survive so well?First of all, hard physical work is a way of life for all of these long-lived people. They begin their long days of physical labor as children and never seem to stop. For example, Mr . Rustam Mamedov is 142 years of age. His wife is 116 years old. They have been married for 90 years. Mr. Mamedov has no intention of retiring from his life as a farmer. ""Why?What else would I do?""he asks. All these people get healthful rewards from the environment in which they work. They all come from mountainous regions. They live and work at elevations of 1,660 to 1,000 meters above sea level. The air has less oxygen and is pollution-free. This reduced-oxygen environment makes the heart and blood vessel system stronger. Another factor that may contribute to the good health of these people is their isolation. To a great extent, they are separated from the pressures and worries of industrial society. Inherited factors also play some role. Most of the longest-lived people had parents and grandparents who also reached very old ages. Good family genes may, therefore, be one factor in living longer."	['Stress and pressure.']
Which of the following is not Magdalena Smith's opinion?	The following are letters to the editor of a school newspaper Dear editor, I'd like to express my opinion about grades. Students should be allowed to study without worrying about grades. Fortunately, most educators are becoming aware of the fact that students have different interests and abilities. I understand that grades are useful, but grades often limit creativity. Competing for better grades causes many students to turn down opportunities to pursue music, dramatics and sports. Grades force an arbitrary standard of success on everyone. I do not demand as some extremists do, that grades be removed immediately. However, I do believe that less emphasis should be placed on grades. I hope that someday grades will become optional at Village High School. Magdalena Smith Drama Club Dear editor, I'd like to say something about grades. Let's face the facts about grades. Grades perform three basic functions. First, grades motivate students to work at their highest level of competence. Second, they act as a reward for hardworking students and as a punishment to students who do not work hard. Finally, grades are used as an effective standard by which to measure student achievement. Good grades help students to get jobs and to get into university. I've spoken with a number of students who have jobs, and most of them say that they were hired primarily on the basis of their grades. My grades helped me land a part-time job and will help me get into university next year. I think grades are extremely important at Village High School.

The main idea of the passage is _ .	Dealing with a difficult roommate can be both annoying and challenging. However, by becoming aware of the context of the situation, steps can be taken in order to improve the circumstance. Identify the source of the problem. Sometimes, when someone is annoying, it is difficult to tell exactly which aspect of the situation is causing the anger. Therefore, it is important to find the one element that caused your anger to begin with. Evaluate the source of the conflict. Is the conflict _ , or is it serious ? Sometimes, people can become angry over things that seem like a big deal at the time, but when contemplated , are really unimportant. Nevertheless, before any problem is dealt with, it is necessary to determine how serious it is. Talk to the roommate about what is bothering you. Communication is very important when dealing with problems. The problems will only become worse if measures are taken without telling one another what is even wrong to begin with. Listen to the explanation that the roommate has to over. Listening is also important when dealing with conflicts. Hearing each side of the story will make it easier to arrive at a possible solution. Compromise with one another in order to form a solution. Sometimes, conflicts can be resolved simply by changing small occurrences.	['how to contend with a difficult roommate.']
It can be inferred from the story that five feet eight inches tall is _ .	"Hank Viscardi was 26 years old when he put on his first pair of long trousers and his first pair of shoes. For the first time he saw himself as he had always wanted to be a full five feet eight inches tall. Hank had been born without legs. Until he was seven, his world was a world of repeated operations. At last he had not legs, but stumps that could be fitted with a kind of special boots. Out of the hospital, Hank often found people staring at him with cruel interest. Children laughed at him and called him ""Ape Man"" because his arms dragged on the ground. He went to school like other boys. His grades were good and he needed only eight years instead of the usual twelve. After graduation, Hank worked his way through college. He swept floors, waited on table, or worked in one of the college offices. During all this busy life, Hank had been moving around on his stumps. But one day the doctor told him even the stumps were not going to last much longer. Hank would soon have to use a wheel chair. Hank felt himself go cold all over. However, the doctor said there was a chance that he could be fitted with artificial legs. Finally a leg maker was found and the day came when Hank stood up before the mirror and saw himself for the first time, five feet eight inches tall. But this was not the end yet. He had to learn to use his new legs. Again and again he marched the length of the room, and marched back again. There were times when he fell down on the floor, but he pulled himself up and went back to the endless marching. He went out on the street. He climbed the stairs and learned to dance. He built a boat and learned to sail it. When World War II came, he talked the Red Cross into giving him a job. He took the regular training. He marched and drilled along with the other soldiers. Few knew that he was legless. This was the true story of Hank Viscardi, the man without legs."	['an average height for an adult']
According to the passage, if you want to increase daily success, you'd better _ .	In my thirty years as a Time Management speaker, I have observed a lot of what we can and should not do to increase our daily success. Time management is not necessarily working harder, but quicker and more smartly. Sometimes our mistakes will keep us from running at a full pace. Here are the top four Time Management mistakes we should all avoid to help us to increase our daily success. a. Start your day without a plan of action in the morning. If so, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough of right things. Time Management is not doing the wrong things. b. Work with a messy desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends one and a half hours per day looking for things. If you have ever visited the office of a top manager who is working with a clean desk, you will find that the manager works efficiently . c. Don't get enough sleep. Studies show that nearly 75% of the people around us complain about not having enough sleep, and then throughout their days they are tired. For most people, they get the quantity of sleep, but they lack the quality of sleep. Their days are filled with so much stress; they are out of control, working harder but maybe not more smartly, so it's difficult for them to get a full night's sleep. d. Don't take a lunch break. Many do not take a lunch break, working through that period in the hope that it will give them more time to increase their success. Studies have shown that it may have the opposite effect. After doing what we do for several hours, we start to feel tired. A lunch break, even short, gives us a chance to get our energy back again.	['work with a clean desk']

What did Butler find when he got through the woman's back door?	"Bob Butler lost his legs in 1965 in Vietnam. Later he returned to the USA and began his life in wheelchair . One day he was working in his yard when he heard a woman calling for help. He began moving towards the woman's house, but something on the ground stopped his wheelchair going through the back door. So he got out of his wheelchair and started to crawl . When Butler got through the back door of the house, he found there was a little girl in the pool. She had no arms and couldn't swim. Her mother was calling for help crazily. Butler got into the pool and pulled the little girl out of the water. Her face was blue, and she was not breathing. Butler did CPR on her right away.

Soon the little girl coughed and began to cry. The mother asked Butler how he knew it would be OK. ""I didn't know,"" he told her.

The animals' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted, and the crowding could result in mass die-offs as fish run out of oxygen. Also, the animals could easily be captured by their enemies. The nearly two-month-old spill has created an environmental disaster in US history as tens of millions of gallons have flown into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Scientists are seeing some unusual things as they try to understand the effects on thousands of species of marine life. For nearly four hours Monday, a three-person crew with Greenpeace cruised past delicate islands and mangrove-dotted inlets in Barataria Bay off southern Louisiana. They saw dolphins by the dozen frolicking in the oily sheen and oil-tinged pelicans feeding their young. But they spotted no dead animals. ""I think part of the reason why we're not seeing more yet is that the impacts of this crisis are really just beginning,"" Greenpeace marine biologist John Hocevar said. The counting of dead wildlife in the Gulf is more than an academic exercise; the deaths will help determine how much BP pays in damages."	['the nearly two-month-old oil spill']
The stone crosses in Ampthill were built _ .	"Treasure hunts have excited people's imagination for hundreds of years both in real life and in books such as Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island .Kit Williams ,a modern writer ,had the idea of combining the real excitement of a treasure hunt with clues found in a book when he wrote a children's story Masquerade, in 1979. The book was about a hare ,and a month before it came out, Williams buried a gold hare in a park in Bedfordshire .The book contained a large number of clues to help readers find the hare ,but Williams put in a lot of ""red herrings "",or false clues ,to mislead _ Ken Roberts ,the man who found the hare ,had been looking for it for nearly two years .Although he had been searching in the wrong area most of the time ,he found it by logic ,not by luck .His success came from the fact that he had gained an important clue at the start .He had realized that the words :""One of Six to Eight"" under the first picture in the book connected the hare in some way to Katherine of Aragon ,the first of Henry VIII's six wives. Even here ,however ,Williams had succeeded in misleading him .Ken knew that Katherine of Aragon had died at Kimbolton in Cambridgeshire in 1536 and thought that Williams had buried the hare there .He had been digging there for over a year before a new idea occurred to him. He found out that Kit Williams had spent his childhood near Ampthill ,in Befordshire and thought that he must have buried the hare in a place he knew well ,but he still could not see the connection with Katherine of Aragon ,until one day he came across two stone crosses in Ampthill Park and learnt that they had been built in her honor in 1773. Even then his search had not come to an end. It was only after he had spent several nights digging around the cross that he decided to write to Kit Williams to find out if he was wasting his time there .Williams encouraged him to continue ,and on February 24th 1982 ,he found the treasure. It was worth PS 3000 in the beginning ,but the excitement it had caused since its burial made it much more valuable ."	"[""to show respect for Henry VIII's first wife""]"
Why was Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation founded?	"Alexandra Scott was born to Liz and Jay Scott in Manchester, Connecticut on January 18, 1996, the second of four children. Shortly before her first birthday, Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer. On her first birthday, the doctors informed Alex's parents that if she beat her cancer it was doubtful that she would ever walk again. Just two weeks later, Alex slightly moved her leg at her parents' request to kick. This was the first indication that she would turn out to be a courageous and confident child with big dreams and big accomplishments. By her second birthday, Alex was able to stand up with leg braces . She worked hard to gain strength and to learn how to walk. She appeared to be overcoming the difficul-ties, until the shocking discovery within the next year that her tumors had started growing again. In the year 2000, the day after her fourth birthday, Alex received a stem cell transplant and informed her mother, ""When I get out of the hospital I want to have a lemonade stand. "" She said she wanted to give the money to doctors to allow them to help other kids, like they helped me. True to her word, she held her first lemonade stand later that year with the help of her older brother and raised an amazing $ 2,000 for her hospital. People from all over the world, moved by her story, held their own lemonade stands and donated the earnings to Alex and her cause. In August of 2004, Alex passed away at the age of 8, knowing that, with the help of others, she had raised more than $ 1 million to help find a cure for the disease that took her life. Alex's family--including brothers Patrick, Eddie, and Joey--and supporters around the world are committed to continuing her inspiring cause through Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation."

The two sisters found that the money wasn't Cathy's _ .	"I was in the park with my elder sister, Cathy, on Friday. My sister left her jacket on a chair while we talked to some friends. When we went back to the chair, a girl in a red T-shirt was sitting there. She had some money in her hand. When she saw us, she stood up and walked away. I asked my sister, ""Did you have any money in your jacket?"" She said, ""Yes, Anna, I did."" I said, ""Look in your jacket quickly."" Cathy looked in her jacket, but her money was not there. ""That girl stole it!"" I said, and we both ran after her. We caught her quickly. My sister was very angry and she said, ""Give me the money."" The girl gave the money to Cathy and ran away. We both ran after her, but we lost her. Then we went home. But before we could tell our parents, my mother said to Cathy, ""You left your money at home. It's on the table in the sitting room. You must be more careful with money."" So the girl in the red T-shirt was not a thief! She probably thought we were thieves! We felt terrible. Please telephone us if you know this girl! We are very sorry for our mistake. We would like to say sorry to her and give the money back to her. Our number is 512667. My name is Anna."	"[""after they heard their mother's words""]"

The psychologists are particularly interested in_.	It is well-known that when an individual joins a group, he tends to accept the group's standards of behavior and thinking. Many illustrations could be given of this from everyday life, but what is of particular interest to psychologists is the extent to which people's judgments and opinions can be changed as a result of group pressure, Asch and others noticed that people in a group will agree to statements that are contrary to the evidence of their senses. It would be a mistake to think that only particularly docile people are chosen to take part in experiments of this type. Usually highly intelligent and independent people are used. In a typical experiment, this is what may happen. The experimenter asks for volunteers to join a group which is investigating visual perception .The victims are not, therefore, aware of the real purpose of the experiment. Each volunteer is taken to a room where he finds a group of about seven people who are cooperating with the experimenter. The group is shown a standard card which contains a single line. They are then asked to look at a second card. This has three lines on it. One is obviously longer than the line on the first card; one is shorter and one the same length. They have to say which line on the second card is the same length as the line on the standard card. The other members of the group answer first but what the volunteer does not know is that they have been told to pick one of the wrong lines. When his turn comes, he is faced with the unanimous opinion of the rest of the group-all the others have chosen line A but he quite clearly sees line B as correct. What will be do? According to Asch, more than half of the vietims chosen will change their opinion. What is equally surprising is that, when interviewed about their answers, most explained that they knew the group choice was incorrect but that they gave in to the pressure of the group because they thought they must be suffering from an optical illusion , or because they were afraid of being different.

According to the text, _ .	"An eighteen-year-old high school student from Utah won the top prize in the Intel Science Talent Search in the United States. The winner received a computer and a scholarship for a college education. More than 1,500students from across the country entered projects in the competition this year. Their research included chemistry, medicine, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science-almost every area of science. Forty students were invited to Washington, D.C. for the final judging. A group of scientists judged them on their research abilities, critical thinking skills and creativity. The judges also questioned the students about scientific problems before deciding on the winners. The top winner received 100,000 dollars for college. Shannon Babb of American Fork High School studied the water quality of tile Spanish Fork River in Utah for six years. She found that people have a harmful effect on the river through human activity, including agriculture. And she suggested ways to improve the water quality in the future. These include educating the public not to put household chemicals down the drains , which lead to the river eventually. Seventeen-year-old Yi Sun of the Hanker School in San Jose, California, earned the second place. He won a 75,000-dollar scholarship for new discoveries about a mathematical theory known as random walks. His work could help computer scientists and chemists. Yi Sun was born in China. The third-place winner was also seventeen and born in China. Yuan ""Chelsea"" Zhang of Montgomery Blair High School in Rockville, Maryland, won a 50,000-dollar scholarship. She researched the molecular genetics of heart disease. Her findings could aid the development of new medicines. The Intel Science Talent Search is the oldest science competition for high school students in the United States. It is 65 years old this year. Past winners have gone on to receive six Nobel prizes and other top honors in science and math."	['Shannon Babb suggested more than one way to improve the water quality']
According to the passage, the white foam _ .	In spring, you may have seen white foam on a green tree or other plants. As a matter of fact, the foam is where young spittlebugs live. These insects are protected by the foam, and they usually don't do much harm to the plants. As we all know, in late summer, a mother spittlebug lays her eggs on the plant. The babies will hatch in spring. After they come to the new world, they begin to eat juice from the plant. The babies eat more juice than their bodies need for food. The extra juice mixes with a special waste that the spittlebugs produce. When this fluid is released, it mixes with the air, forming bubbly foam. What is so great about having a foam home? The space inside is so wet that it can keep the bugs' soft bodies from drying out. And the foam tastes bad, so it keeps away most animals that would eat the bugs. Some birds will reach their heads through the foam to find the bugs. Wasps and ants might eat them, too. But most of the bugs stay safe inside the foam. Once the bugs have grown into adults, they stop making foam. They leave their homes and jump from plant to plant in search of food. The adults look a little like tiny frogs. For this reason they are also called froghoppers. If you see some foam on a plant, you might want to take a careful look inside. Gently push some of the foam aside with a small stick. Deep inside you may see a few insects eating plant juice. They might also be making more foam. Be sure to push the foam back after a moment to cover the insects and keep them safe. Soon the spittlebugs will grow up and leave their foam home. They will join the other insects in the grassland.	"[""is plant juice mixed with spittlebugs' waste and the air""]"
Why did Jeb pull his jacket open when he saw the cougar?	"Lying in the sun on a rock, the cougar saw Jeb and his son, Tom, before they saw it. Jeb put his bag down quickly and pulled his jacket open with both hands, making himself look big to the cougar. It worked. The cougar hesitated, ready to attack Jeb, but ready to forget the whole thing, too. Jeb let go of his jacket, grasped Tom and held him across his body, making a cross. Now the cougar's enemy looked even bigger, and it rose up, ready to move away, but unfortunately Tom got scared and struggled free of Jeb. ""Tom, no!"" shouted his father. But Tom broke and ran and that's the last thing you do with a cougar. The second Tom broke free, Jeb threw himself on the cougar, just as it jumped from the rock. They hit each other in mid-air and both fell. The cougar was on Jeb in a flash, forgetting about Tom, which was what Jeb wanted. Cougars are not as big as most people think and a determined man stands a chance, even with just his fists. As the cougar's claws got into his left shoulder, Jeb swung his fist at its eyes and hit hard. The animal howled and put its head back. Jeb followed up with his other fist. Then out of the corner of his eye, Jeb saw Tom. The boy was running back to help his father. ""Knife, Tom"" shouted Jeb. The boy ran to his father's bag, while Jeb stated shouting as well as hitting, to keep the cougar's attention away from Tom. Tom got the knife and ran over to Jeb. The cougar was moving its head in and out, trying to find a way through the wall Jeb was making out of his arms. Tom swung with the knife, into the cougar's back. It howled horribly and ran off into the mountains. The whole fight had taken about thirty seconds."	['To frighten it away']
If you want to read a story about a magic American Indian, you can read _ .	We considered a list of the best American books. Here are five that may help accurately show the national character. Most from a century or so ago, they still entertain, teach, and inspire: Moby-Dick by Herman Melville First published in 1851, the adventure stories of Captain Ahab and his monomaniacal pursuit of the white whale draw us into a universe full of fascinating characters and stories. The Education of Henry Adams by Henry Adams Published in 1918, the book was an autobiography. Born in one of America's most famous political families, Adams provides insight into his family, including his experience as private secretary to his father, minister to England during the American Civil war. Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman When Whitman published Leaves of Grass in 1855, he wanted to accurately describe the American experience and reflect the great changes in the American literary world that had taken place during his lifetime. Poems by Emily Dickinson An enthusiastic poet whose works have had considerable influence on modern poetry, Dickson's frequent use of dashes, occasional capitalization of nouns, and unconventional metaphors have contributed to her reputation as one of the most inventive poets of the 19thcentury American literature. However, most of her poems were not published during her lifetime. The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow First published in 1855, this is Longfellow's most popular and most recognized poem, the heroic life and death of a magic American Indian, sent by the Great Spirit to guide the nations in the ways of peace.	['The Song of Hiawatha']
In the case of cars, the author advises that we _ .	As goods and services improved, people were persuaded to spend their money on changing from old to new, and found the change worth the expense. When an airline equipped itself with jets, for example, its costs (and therefore air fare) would go up, but the new planes meant such an improvement that the higher cost was justified. A new car (or wireless, washing machine, electric kettle) made life so much more comfortable than the old one that the high cost of replacement was fully repaid. Manufacturers still cry their goods as persuasively as ever, but are the improvements really worth paying for? In many fields, things have now reached such a high standard of performance that further progress is very limited and very, very expensive. Airlines, for example, go to enormous expense in buying the latest jets , in which vast research costs have been spent on ly small improvements. If we abandon these vast costs we might lose the chance of cutting minutes away from flying times; but wouldn't it be better to see airfares drop dramatically, as capital costs become ly insignificant? Again, in the context of a 70 m. p. h. Limit, with lines of cars traveling so close as to control each other's speeds, improvements in performance are actually irrelevant; improvements in handling are unnecessary, as most production cars grip the road perfectly, and comfort has now reached a very high level. Small improvements here are unlikely to be worth the thousands that anybody replacing an ordinary family car every two years may have spent on them. Let us instead have cars -- or wireless, electric kettles, washing machines, television sets -- which are made to last, and not to be replaced. Significant progress is obviously a good thing, but the insignificant progression from model-change to model-change is not.	['improve their durability']
What can we learn from the text?	"A year ago August, Dave Fuss lost his job driving a truck for a small company in west Michigan. His wife, Gerrie, was still working in the local school cafeteria , but work for Dave was scarce (,), and the price of everything was rising. The Fusses were at risk of joining the millions of Americans who have lost their homes in recent years. Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely gift--$7,000,a legacy from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch, who died in an accident . "" It really made a difference when we were going under financially, "" says Dave. But the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the Hatches. Dozens of other families were touched by the Hatches' generosity. In some cases, it was a few thousand dollars ; in others, it was more than $100,000. It surprised nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $3 million--they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm . Children of the Great Depression, Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of saving, They thrived on comparison shopping and would routinely go from store to store, checking prices before making a new purchase . Through the years, the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camp when their parents couldn't afford it. ""Ish and Arlene never asked if you needed anything,"" says their friend Sand Van Weelden, ""They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them. Even more extraordinary was that the Hatches had their farmland distributed (;). It was the Hatches' wish that their legacy--a legacy of kindness as much as one of dollars and cents should enrich the whole community and last for generations to come. Neighbors helping neighbors ----that was Ish and Arlene Hatch's story."	['The Hatches would like the neighbors to follow their example']
People can see the best samba parades on _	"Carnival is an explosion of joy. It is a festival that mixes creativity, color1s, sounds, costumes and so on. The carnival in Rio starts on Saturday, and ends on Tuesday. Little need to be said about the carnival in Rio. Every year, Rio hosts the world's largest carnival. The samba school parades are world-famous. The festival begins officially when the city's mayor hands over a giant silver and gold key to the Fat King (King Momo) . Then people dance, sing, party and have tons of fun. There are many parties that take lace before, during and after the carnival all night and all day. Samba schools are not teaching institutions as their names suggests and do not offer samba classes.There are over 70 samba schools in Rio de Janeiro and they all parade during the 4-day celebration.They are organized into six competitive leagues.They are the Special Group A,B,C,Dand E.The first three groups parade in the Sambodromo.The other groups parade on the streets and are free to watch and join in.The biggest and most popular 12 leading schools are from the Special Group.They create a pageant with 3,000 to 5,000 people competing in the Samba Parade in the Sambodromo on Carnival Sunday and Monday. Balls takes place every night throughout the week, together with a variety of costume contests. One of the most frequent questions we hear is "" What is the date of the carnival this year?"" Well, believe it or not , it is not an easy question to answer. You have to be part astrologer , part mathematician, and part priest."	['Sunday and Monday']
We learn from the text that before 1805 _ .	"Grey clouds move as low as smoke over the treetops at Lolo Pass. The ground is white. The day is June 10.It has been snowing for the past four days in the Bitterroot Mountains.Wayne Fairchild is getting worried about our trek over the Lolo Trail-95 miles from Lolo Montana to Weippe in Idaho, across the roughest country in the West. Lewis and Clark were nearly defeated 200 years ago by snowstorms on the Lolo.Today Fairchild is nervously checking the weather reports.He has agreed to take me across the toughest,middle section of the trail. When Lewis climbed on top of Lemhi Pass,140 miles south of Missoula,on Aug.12,1805,he was astonished by what was in front of him;""high mountain chains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow.""Nobody in what was then the US knew the Rocky Mountains existed,with peaks twice as high as anything in the Appalachians back East. Today their pathway through those mountains holds more attraction than any other ground over which they traveled,for its raw wilderness is an evidence to the character of two cultures:the explorers who braved its hardships and the Native Americans who prize and conserve the path as a sacred gift. It remains today the same condition as when Lewis and Clark walked it. The Lolo is passable only from July to mid-September.Our luck is holding with the weather,although the snow keeps getting deeper.As we climb to Indian Post Office,the highest point on the trail at 7,033 ft,we have covered 13 miles in soft snow,and we hardly have enough energy to make dinner.After a meal of chicken,I sit on a rock on top of the ridge .There is no light visible in any direction,not even another campfire.For four days we do not see another human being.We are occupied with the things that mix fear with joy.In our imagination we have finally caught up with Lewis and Clark."

What is the good news about wasted food according to Nierenberg?	"The Worldwatch Institute said in 2011 far too many people were living with less than they needed. It says, for example, nearly one billion people were hungry arid just as many were illiterate . Worldwatch Institute's Danielle Nierenberg said while a billion people went to bed hungry each night, it wasn't because of a lack of available food. ""We produce more than enough food in the world to feed not only the 7 billion people who are on earth today, but 9 to 11 billion people. By 2050, we expect the population to be about 9 and a half billion people and we now produce enough food to feed all of those people. But the question is really one of how do we get food to the people who need it the most. Poverty really delays the progress of allowing people to eat well. Not just getting enough basic crops, but being able to buy fruits and vegetables and the things that will really nourish them,"" she said. The director of the Nourishing the Planet Project said besides poverty and a lack of access to food, much food is simply lost. Worldwatch estimates 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted each year. ""20 to 50 percent of the global food harvest is wasted before it can ever reach people's stomachs. And this is really a moral problem when you consider all of the people who are hungry in the world. The good news about that 20 to 50 percent of global food waste number is that it's easy to prevent food waste.We can do it in our homes. Consumers can do a lot to prevent food waste by planning meals better, by not buying too much food. In the developing world there are storage systems that are beginning to be put in place that help farmers protect their food from crop diseases or molds ,""she said. Nierenberg said prevention measures can be put in place all along the food chain. While it may not seem obvious, the Worldwatch Institute project director said malnutrition and illiteracy are closely linked. ""When people, especially farmers, don't have the education that they need to live productive lives, they can't learn new skills. And in sub-Saharan Africa, women farmers, especially, don't have access to education. This prevents them from not only learning new cropping techniques and learning new technologies; it also prevents them from being able to get financial and banking services. They can't have bank accounts. They can't buy land. They can't buy the inputs that they need to make their crops more productive,"" she said. Nierenberg said despite the many challenges, Worldwatch is hopeful for the future. She says there are a growing number of new projects to address hunger and poverty, while at the same time protecting the environment."	['Global food waste can be easily prevented.']
What would be the best title for the passage?	Researchers who study relationships have discovered that a big difference between those who make new friends easily, and those who don't, is that socially successful people tend to make eye contact with their conversation partners much more frequently than those who are less successful socially. In fact, you may be able to become much more socially successful by making this one simple change to your behavior. Most Americans prefer to have a lot of eye contact when they are talking with someone. When a person doesn't make eye contact with them, they tend to think that the person is hiding something or the person doesn't believe in himself/herself. When you are having a conversation and you want to leave a friendly impression, be sure to keep looking at that person frequently while you are talking. If it really bothers you to look directly into another person's eyes, you can gaze generally at, not above, the eyebrow area or the bridge of the nose; this is close enough to the eye region that you will appear to be looking at the person's eyes. But neither the hair or the shoulders have the same effect. Don't stare at other people too intensely, otherwise, you will look aggressive . Keep the majority of your focus on the other person. If you glance around the room too much, or look too frequently at other people, your conversation partner may guess that you are looking around for someone else you would rather talk with. You can lighten your nervousness by smiling more often, nodding, and by gazing at the entire face as well as the eyes. In addition, you can frequently look away for very short periods. When people get the sense that you are really paying attention to them, they will be much more likely to want to have conversations with you!	['How to use eye contact to make a good impression']
Which of the following could be the title of the passage?	"It was the Year from Hell - the dog died, my marriage of 24 years ended, and my house burned down. I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house. My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, ""Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son."" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years. We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, ""Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!"" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed. It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail. I'm also grateful for the lessons I learned from the fire and the other losses that came so suddenly, so fast. Much to my surprise, I found gratitude among the ashes. I was tested serious trial by fire. But, like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes strong and whole. I would not be the person I am today if not for that Year from Hell."	['Gratitude among the Ashes.']
What was the trouble while living with the British students?	Finding a suitable place to live is not easy for a student who first arrived in a strange place . I was lucky because I had booked a dormitory with the school before I arrived .. I t was a flat with seven independent rooms and a shared bathroom and kitchen . all of my flatmates are all students form Britain . I thought I was lucky to be part of this flat with these energetic young men . However , I found myself unhappy with them only a few days after I stayed there . These young people seemed never to be quiet . Usually they would not come back until late into the night .They even played football in the room whenever they like , whether _ was early morning or late night . Worse still , they always had parties . Those loud music and laughter made me sleepless the whole night . Finally , I had no choice but to ask the authority to move me to another flat where most of the students were international students pursuing their master degrees . They were older in age and hold heavier study burden . So they were quieter . My advice for those who want to study in the UK is to get in touch with the international student accommodation service of your school first and tell them to arrange for you to share a flat with graduates before you come here.

What made the writer think of his childhood?	"""BANG!"" the door caused a reverberation .It was just standing there, with Father standing on one side, and I on the other side. We were both in great anger.""Never set foot in this house again!"" stormed Father.With tears welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street. The street lights were shining rather desolately .I wandered aimlessly. A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me.I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and harmonious. But now... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because dad is getting old.We differ in our ways of thinking.He always imposes his opinions and codes of behavior on me.Whenever I do something wrong, he never admits it.We are just like two people coming from two different worlds.It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened. I wandered the streets, without a destination in mind.My heart was frozen on this hot summer night.As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, until I had only the street lights to keep me company.When I finally reached the high-rise apartment block in which I lived, I saw that the light was still on. In fact, it was nothing.Perhaps, dad was throwing away some of his old stamps.Perhaps he thought they were useless.I never had the courage to tell him that I liked collecting stamps.I can't stand his outrageous words: "" I can throw you away, let alone these old papers."" All the lights were off except father's. Dad was always like this.Maybe he didn't know how to express himself.After shouting at me, he never showed any mercy or any moments of regret.After an argument he has the habit of creeping up in my sleep and then tucking me underneath the covers. This was how he always was.He has been a leader for so long that telling everyone else what to do has become his second nature. The light was still on.""Am I wrong?"" I whispered, maybe... With the key in hand, I was as nervous as I had ever been.At last, I decided to open the door.As soon as I opened the door, tears ran down my cheeks.I suddenly realized that the iron door that I had imagined between us did not exist at all.Love - is second to none."

When she was upstairs, the woman _ .	For some minutes, all was quiet in the street. Then from across the street someone came walking. It looked like a man of middle height, dressed in a big raincoat, a soft hat and rubber-soled boots or shoes, and making little sound while walking. No one was in sight. It was a street with two rows of about fifty small houses and there were three lamps on either side. The lamp nearest to the child's house could be seen clearly, but the others were almost hidden by the smoky air. A car passed the end of the street and its lights showed faintly,but clearly enough to show the smooth skin of a woman's face. The car disappeared as the woman, wrapped up in her coat, reached the doorway of the child's house. She put a key in the lock quickly, pushed the door open and stepped inside, then closed the door without looking round. She began to breathe hard. She leaned against the door for a moment, then straightened up as if with an effort, and walked towards the door of the front room, the passage leading to the kitchen, and the narrow staircase. She hesitated outside the door, then went up the stairs quickly but with hardly a sound. There was enough light from the narrow hall to show the four doors leading off a small landing . She pushed each door open in turn and shone a torch inside, and the light fell upon beds, walls, furniture, a bathroom hand-basin, a mirror which flashed brightness back; but this was not what the woman was looking for. She turned away and went downstairs, and hesitated again at the foot of the stairs, then turned towards the kitchen. Clearly there was nothing there, or in the small washroom that she wanted. Two rooms remained; the front room and a smaller one next to it. She opened the front room door. After a moment, she saw the child's bed and the child.	['opened four different doors']
What do we know about the giant flashlight fish?	"The deep sea is one of the most mysterious places on earth. Scientists rarely go there. Those few do discover new species all of the time. Many places of the deepest parts of the ocean, where it's forever dark, can light up. Now, a teen's research has shown new light on how one of these swimming animals behaves in darkness. The giant flashlight fish lives in the Indian Ocean as well as in tropical parts of the central and western Pacific. It lives at depths of up to 400 meters, (about 1,300 feet). But not always. Sometimes it lives in coral reefs in shallow waters. In those shallow waters, the blackish-blue fish comes out only at night. Reef-dwelling members of this species tend to be smaller than those living in deeper waters. Those biggies can grow to lengths of 35meters (14inches). That may not sound like a giant, but they are the largest of their type of fish. The giant flashlight fish gets its name from a small glow-in-the-dark patch found in a packet of tissue under each eye, explains Caroline Edmonds. She is a 13- year-old student from Fountain Valley, Calif. There, she attends Talbert Middle School. She said that the eye pockets in these fish contain light-producing bacteria. These bacteria and their host fish have built a relationship that helps both. The fish use the bacteria as a way to communicate with creatures around them. The bacteria gain nutrients from the fish and a safe place to live. When a fish wants to "" flash"" its light, it turns the bacteria-filled pocket toward the outside of its body, Caroline explains. When a fish wants to hide its light, it turns the pocket back toward the inside. According to her data, the fish flash most often when they are being fed. They flash least often late at night, when they are resting."	['It can be found in coral reefs at times.']
When Disney began making cartoon movies, _ .	"Walt Disney began to make cartoon movies when he was young. But he didn't have much money and he didn't always have enough to eat. One day a mouse ran near his desk when he worked in his small office. ""Would you like to be my pet? ""Disney asked the mouse. He caught the mouse and kept it as a pet. A few years later, Disney decided to make a cartoon about it. ""I am making a cartoon about a mouse named Mortimer,"" he told his wife. ""Mortimer Mouse? I think Mickey Mouse would be a better name."" She said. ""You are right!"" Disney agreed and made many Mickey Mouse cartoons. People all over the world saw Mickey and loved it. Mickey Mouse made Disney famous. Then come Donald Duck, and Goofy Dog and others. Disney began to make full length cartoons. Then he made cartoon movies for television. Millions of children watched the shows every week. In California, real boats, castles , trains, mountains, rivers, all in one beautiful park. Millions of people came to Disneyland.

The writer's attitude toward Industry 4.0 can best be described as _ .	"The term ""Industry 4.0"" refers to the fourth industrial revolution. The first industrial revolution was the production of goods with machines like steam engines, which was followed by the second industrial revolution that introduced mass production with the help of electric power, followed by the digital revolution --the use of electronics and IT in production. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech project, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing . The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, we are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other automatically. The goal is the Smart Factory, which adapts well and uses resources efficiently as well as linking customers and business partners with great intelligence. Technological basis are the Internet systems and advanced factories. Experts believe that Industry 4.0 could be a reality in about 10 to 20 years. So, what effects does this change have on the classic manufacturing? According to an expert, ""it is highly likely that the world of production will become more and more networked until everything is connected with everything else."" Networks and processes have so far been limited to one factory. But in the time of Industry 4.0, the boundaries of individual factories will most likely no longer exist. Instead, they will be lifted in order to inter-connect multiple factories or even geographical regions. How is an Industry 4.0 factory different from a today's factory? In current industry environment, providing high-end quality service or product with the least cost is the key to success. Factories are trying to increase their profit as much as possible. In the time of Industry 4.0, various data sources are available to provide worthwhile information about different aspects of the factory. Using data for understanding the current condition and checking faults and failures is a natural thing. _ will enable these connected systems to manage themselves independently, work more efficiently and identify any errors quickly. The good news is that Europe is much better prepared for the Industry 4.0 revolution than one might think. Europe will position itself as a pioneer in the fourth revolution. Industry 4.0 is a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government. Meanwhile, in the U.S., some companies are also working hard on it. But the success of industry depends on whether business and politics can work together. It's not only politics that needs to help open the door for Industry 4.0. Every company is advised to seize the new digital opportunities."	['supportive']

According to the survey, _ cared little about their appearance.	"How often do you change your hairstyle or ask for new dresses? You may try to follow trends in Western countries,but your peers in the United States don't care as much about fashion as you do. A recent survey among high school students in China,Japan,South Korea and the US found that Asian teenagers care more about their looks than young people in the US. This survey was held in 156 high schools in the four countries. More than 7,000 teenagers were questioned about their view on life and the world. South Koreans, at 83 percent, cared most about their appearance. They were followed by the Chinese and Japanese while US students showed the least interest in fashion at only 33 percent. ""The different results show differences of cultural background,"" said Sun Yunxiao from the China Youth and Children Research Centre. He explained that in the US there are many different _ of beauty, so teens are more likely to be confident about their appearance. US teenagers' high self-confidence is showed in survey.

What's the purpose of the passage?	Why do people buy art? To answer this question, ask yourself what your reasons are for thinking of getting a piece of art. An artwork can cost a large amount of money, but if it meets your needs, it's worth every penny. People buy art for many reasons. Many people buy an artwork simply because they like it, even if it is by an unknown artist. Art, as long as you enjoy it, is never a waste of money. Art is for enjoyment. Art is meant to be shown. Don't ever feel pressured into buying something you won't enjoy looking at day after day, no matter what other people may say. Don't buy something that doesn't attract you just because it is trendy, or because the artist is famous, or because you have been advised that the artwork will make a good investment. If you don't like the artwork at all, don't buy it! Art improves your environment. Have you ever noticed that all beautiful homes have art as an integral part of the decoration? Art lends life and color to otherwise plain and ordinary walls. A well thought--out art collection will help create a unique atmosphere in your home and make it more attractive. Art makes a statement. The kind of art you surround yourself with says much about your personality tastes and values. _ . Art enriches your life. Love--even the love of a work of art--contributes to healthier living and a longer lifespan . Art should enrich your life. Otherwise, why do you spend precious time and resources on it? Just remember to select something which will appeal to your tastes, and keep to a sensible budget. Good art needn't cost an arm and a leg. Happy art collecting!

Who was Jack?	"One evening in November, Berlin received a telephone call from Mrs. Green. ""Please, Dr Berlin, come to my house. I had 50,000 dollars on my desk and now it is gone."" Dr Berlin arrived at Mrs. Green's house at eight o'clock. First he asked Mrs. Green, ""When did you see the money last?"" ""At seven o'clock. I put it on my desk in my living room. Then I went to wash my hair. I came back at seven thirty and the money was gone."" ""I see."" Dr Berlin said. ""Were you alone in the house?"" ""No. My sister's son Jack is here, too."" Then Dr Berlin and Mrs. Green went to Jack's room. ""Please, sit down,"" Jack said. Dr Berlin sat on the only chair in the room, and the chair was cold. He also saw some books on the ground near his feet. ""What have you been doing this evening?"" Dr Berlin asked. ""I came home at six-thirty, and went right to my room. I've been sitting in that chair and reading all the evening. I never got up and I never left the room. Maybe somebody came into the house and took my aunt's money."" After hearing that, Dr Berlin was clear about who had taken the money."	"[""Mrs. Green's nephew.""]"
Which statement is TRUE?	"Think of some of your favorite singers. When you listen, they can make you happy or sad, peaceful or angry. They can make you relax or want to get up and dance. Gifted singers have the power to affect us in many ways -- emotionally, physically and mentally. But becoming a great singer isn't as easy as listening to one. It takes practice, devotion and strong lungs! Just ask the well-known American opera star Carol Vaness. At the Metropolitan Opera in prefix = st1 /New York Citywhere she often sings, Carol's voice must be loud enough to be heard by four thousand people. It must reach every person in the theater, without a microphone, even when she's singing softly. The reason Carol can project her voice that far is the way she breathes. ""When you breathe, it's like a swimmer taking a deep breath before going underwater,"" Carol explains. ""You have to take a lot of air into your lungs."" According to Carol, the main difference between pop singing and opera is ""how you breathe, how much air you take in, and how you control it coming out. Regular singing is more like speaking, and it's a lot softer. When I sing for children, they're often surprised by how the vibrations strike their ears -- like waves on a beach, "" Carol says. ""In opera, the air doesn't just go out of your mouth -- it vibrates in your chest, the way a guitar vibrates when it's played. "" Ever since she started piano lessons at the age of ten, Carol has loved music. As she got older, she decided to become a music teacher. When she went to college, she took singing lessons as part of her studies. Her voice teacher discovered that nineteen-year-old Carol had an exceptionally beautiful soprano voice - the highest singing voice for women. Carol decided to make opera her goal, not only because she loved to sing but also because she loved the drama. Opera is a play in which the characters sing the words instead of speaking them. The stories of opera can be tragic or comical. They can be personal stories about two people falling in love or grand stories about kings and queens who lived long ago. As the characters in an opera sing, the emotions expressed by words and music come to life. Today, Carol performs throughout the United Statesand Europe and she has song for almost twenty years. But she has never forgotten where she started singing in the first palace. ""Put your heart into your singing and enjoy it,"" says Carol, ""because singing is a great joy. That's why I sing. In fact, that's why everybody sings. """	['An opera singer breathes differently from a pop singer when singing.']

""Were sharing. Mother."" Sylvia replied. ""It really wasn't necessary."" Jack explained proudly, ""I've had a big rise, and we can easily manage. It's much better to be independent."" ""Oh, much,"" I agreed ""What was the trouble?"" Kitty asked, impatient and unwilling to let her go. ""Nothing much."" Sylvia said, ""The flat is fine. It was the other couple. Sally and Tom Ford.

The passage mainly tells the reader _ .	"Holiday Inns and McDonald's. both saw unmatched growth in the 1960s. Their growth opened another direct business operation--franchising. These operations have the same general pattern. The franchisor, the parent company, first establishes a successful retail business. As it expands, it sees a profit potential in offering others the right to open similar business under its name. The parent company's methods and means of identification with consumers are included in this right. The parent company supplies skill, and may build and rent stores to franchisees. For these advantages the franchisee pays the franchisor a considerable fee. However, some of the advantages and disadvantages are different. By extending a ""proven"" marketing method, a parent can profit in several ways. First, the franchisee's purchase price gives the parent an immediate return on the plan. Then the sale of supplies to the franchisee provides a continuing source of profits. As new businesses are added and the company's reputation spreads, the values of the franchise increases and sales of franchises become easier. The snowballing effect can be dramatic. Such growth, too, bring into play the economies of scale. Regional or national advertising that might be financially impossible for a franchisor with 20 franchises could be profitable for one with 40. The parent, then, finds immediate gains from the opportunity to expand markets on the basis of reputation alone, without having to put up capital or take the risk of owning retail stores. Added to this advantage is a less obvious but material one, Skilled, responsible retail managers are rare. People who invest their capital in franchises, though, probably come closer to the ideal than do paid managers. In fact, the franchisee is an independent store operator working for the franchisor, but without an independent's freedom to drop supplies at will. Of course the factory's costs of selling supplies are less. But also certainly the franchisee buying goods that have had broad consumer acceptance will not casually change supplies, even when the contract permits. If the hamburger is not what the customer expected, they may not return. Having paid for the goodwill, the franchisee won't thoughtlessly destroy it."

What's the main idea of the passage?	"Change is one of the common facts of life. Most of us have seen a number of changes in our own lives from simple things like fashion trends and entertainment to big changes in technology. Language, too, has experienced change and continues to develop. The continuous change is what keeps languages alive. Slang is a way in which languages can transform and are renewed. Slang is the use of informal words and expressions that are not considered standard in a language. Some consider slang to be witty and clever, adding spice to the informal written and spoken language. Walt Whitman described slang as ""the start of imagination and humor, breathing into its nostrils the breath of life"". However, others criticize its use, believing that it weakens the language. The spoken English language of today's younger generation is filled with slang words and expressions. These lively words and phrases are an example of how language plants its own seeds of change that develop within social circumstances. Sometimes slang is the use of a word that is already in the standard dictionary, for example, lift (to pick up or raise) is given a new meaning, such as ""to steal""; or hunk (a large piece of something) has now become ""a handsome man"". Other times, slang is an invented word, such as chocoholic, which means ""a person who loves chocolate"". Other invented words are mula, which means ""money"" and airhead, which means ""a person who is stupid"". Now, you'll understand your friends if they say something like, ""I was such an airhead to think that I could get away with lifting a whole box of chocolates from the store just because I was all out of mula."""

Why does the author write the passage?	"February 1 , 2012 marked the first ever Digital Learning Day, a day devoted to exploring, promoting and celebrating revolutionary teaching and instruction practices that involve students in the digital world around them.This daylong celebration was organized in recognition of the fast-changing landscape of the social and work environment students find themselves a part of.But as a whole, education has dropped behind the digital revolution. Digital Learning Day sought to bring awareness to the great influence of digital learning on the classroom and the amazing potential digital technologies have to involve students in new ways and motivate them to create and cooperate. The day started with a National Town Hall meeting, accessed online, of course.Schools around the country used Skype to join the conversation and interact with the speakers.Participants, including 39 states, 15,000 teachers and more than 2 million students, were all involved in some form of digital learning activities and revolution.The activities across the nation showed some of the best in digital education. Many schools celebrated by using iPads.Miller Junior High School in Aberdeen, Wash.distributed an iPad to every 7th and 8th grade student.Other schools used the notebooks for science projects, health projects and photography. Kindergarteners in Topeka, Kansas used Skype to communicate with other classrooms and learn about how other students learn. The daylong celebration also _ in the digital world with bloggers commenting on digital education trends, teachers using Twitter and social media to share information and online articles. What' s clear from the events of the day is that education needs to catch up with the digital revolution.Students shouldn ' t first hear about the "" cloud"" or interact with a wiki after graduation.Schools should include digital and technology revolutions in daily instruction.Plus, digital technologies can grow and improve the cooperative, creative and critical thinking skills students need to succeed later in life.

The duty of the queen ants is to .	"Scientists have always been interested in the high level of organization in ant societies. American researchers have watched ants build life-saving rafts to keep afloat during floods. They also have documented how ant colonies choose their next queen--the female whose job is to produce eggs rather than seek food for others. New technology is helping to improve researchers' understanding of the insects. But there is still a lot to be learned. Fire ants living in Brazilian forests are perfectly at home in an environment where flooding is common. To save themselves, the insects connect their legs together and create floating rafts. Some ant rafts can be up to 20 centimeters wide. David Hu who is a mechanical engineer with the Georgia Institute of Technology, also known as Georgia Tech, says, ""If you have 100 ants, which means 600 legs, 99 percent of those legs will be connected to a neighbor. So they're very, very good at maintaining this network."" David Hu and other Georgia Tech researchers want to study ants and the secret of their engineering. They freeze ant rafts and then look at them with the help of computed technology, or CT, images. The pictures show that larger ants serve in central positions to which smaller ants hold. The larger ants form pockets of air that keep the insects afloat. Scientists say small robots or materials that can change shape could be programmed in a similar way, working towards a shared goal. Researchers at North Carolina State University are also studying ants. They examined how Indian jumping ants choose the leader of the colony when they lose their top female or queen."	['lay eggs']
According to the author, before going to sleep, you'd better _ .	"A Good Night's Steep Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. While you're sleeping, your brain is forming new pathways to help you learn and remember information. Although we all know the importance of getting a good night's sleep, not all of us know the best way of getting it. A sleep expert, Phil Atherton, gave some top tips for getting the most out of the night, which will leave you ready for action in the morning. According to Phil Atherton, not eating a large meal before bedtime is important for getting a good night's sleep. The time difference between eating and sleeping should be at least three hours. So you'd better avoid eating any food three hours before bed, as it will lower your blood sugar during sleep and help minimize damage from too much sugar floating around. It's also important to find ways to prepare your body for sleep. You can follow a routine like trying not to expose yourself to too much artificial light within 1 hour before bed, as your brain uses light to help set internal ""body clock"". Although it might seem unnatural to schedule your sleep, the purpose is to send a signal to your body and mind that it's time to sleep. Another way to prepare your body for sleep is to get into a relaxed state by taking a bath or listening to soft music. Both of them will help to take the mind off the daytime pressures. Having a suitable bed, especially a suitable mattress , is necessary for a good night's sleep. Sleep is a personalized activity, and we all adopt different sleeping positions. Finding the mattress that suits you will reduce back pains that can result from a poor sleeping position. The bed should be four to six inches longer than its tallest user, allowing for space to move around. The recent research is pretty clear that a good night's sleep in a major component of good health. Since the start of the 21st century, studies have linked a lack of sleep to many diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Taking action now will lead to long-term benefits for you and those around you."	['free yourself from tension']

"" is also what they are scared of most."" The study was conducted online May 5-10 by Insight Research Group. It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog. Parents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online. Findings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says. Internet safety has become an increasing concern for parents in America. Organizations like the Non-profit Common Sense have been trying to reach and help parents pay attention to the problem."

To fight forgetting effectively, we're advised to _ .	"Man still has a lot to learn about the most powerful and complex part of his body -- the brain. It may be surprising to learn that it isn't age that makes you lose your memory. The reason could be that you have a ""lazy"" memory, not an old one. Like your body your memory improves with exercise. Once given plenty of exercise, the brain keeps its power. Before discussing how to improve the memory, let's look at how the brain works. There are two sides to the brain, the left and the right. The right side deals with the senses (what we see, hear, feel and smell). It's the creative and imaginative side. The left side is concerned with logic. It analyzes information and puts it in order. Some recent research suggests that we remember everything that happens to us. The problem most of us has is recalling events. Most forgetting takes place immediately after learning. An hour after learning something new, more than 50% has been forgotten. After a month, 80% has been forgotten, and so on. This shows revision is very important. If you revise new material you have learnt, you remember much more. So it's of vital importance to revise newly learned material often, and have frequent breaks. We best remember what we learn at the beginning of a learning period and at the point where we stop. After the break, revise what was learned before the break and then continue learning the new material. These breaks should happen every 20 or 45 minutes. Other experiments have shown the brain needs time to ""digest"" what has been learned. The time necessary for this is 5 to 10 minutes. After the break, the memory will have absorbed what it has just learned, and more will be remembered. During this period it is important to exercise the right side of the brain, because the left side is used during the learning period. Therefore you should relax. Listening to music, breathing in fresh air, and looking at a picture are all ways of using the other side of the brain.

If students do as the experts say, they will _ .	Fangfang, a 15-year-old Chinese girl, likes eating snacks very much. She prefers cream biscuits, McDonald's food, KFC, and Beijing roast duck. Sometimes she eats two packages of biscuits a day. As a result, she becomes _ . Today in China, there are many children like Fangfang. They like snacks. They don't eat enough healthy foods like vegetables and fruit. It's very bad for their health. Poor eating habits are a serious problem. Health experts say that children should have healthy eating habits. First, they must eat regular meals and begin with a good breakfast. Second, they should have different kinds of foods, such as fruit, vegetables, grain, eggs, milk and meat and so on. Third, the children shouldn't eat too many snacks and fried foods. They are delicious, but eating too much of them is unhealthy. If children do as the experts say, they won't become fat. They will be healthier. Students won't become tired at school, and they will have enough energy to study well.	['have enough energy to study']

""I know how hard you have all worked to get ready for this test. "" he said. ""And because I know you are all able to understand these questions. I am ready to offer a B to anyone who would prefer not to take the test. '' A number of students jumped up to thank the teacher and left the classroom. The teacher looked at the rest students and said. ""Does anyone else want to get a B? This is your last chance. ""Two more students decided to go. Seven students stayed. The teacher then handed out the papers. There were only three sentences on the paper: Congratulations! You have received an A in this class. Keep believing in yourself. I never had a teacher who gave a test like that. but I think that it is a test that any teacher could and should give. Students who do not have confidence in what they have learned are B students at most. The same is true for students in real life. The A students are those who believe in what they are doing because they have learned from both successes and failures. They have learned life's lessons. whether from school education or from events in their lives,and have become better people.

What will happen to human bodies in space?	Human beings have a natural desire to explore the unknown. People with a strong interest in space like to say it is the last place left to explore. But scientists are warning that space exploration for long periods is not going to be easy. They say the human body is not designed to stay in space over an extended period. The New York Times recently published a report about scientists who are preparing astronauts for a trip to the Moon. The newspaper said the scientists want to make sure that their crews return home in good health. But there are many problems to be solved before people are ready for long trips to the Moon, an asteroid or even the planet Mars. Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field. In outer space, there is no such protection.	['Pressure in the skull will be raised.']

""My wife couldn't bear another delivery because of her heart condition and her age. Surrogacy helps avoid the risks to older mothers,"" Tang said, ""Moreover, our second child will be born in the US and become a citizen there. That is not a bad choice."" The couple spent weeks researching their move, looking for a reliable agency that provides surrogacy services overseas. Surrogacy is still illegal in many countries, including China. ""We will be taking much higher risks by relying on a surrogate mother in China because we are not protected by any regulation or law. You pay a lot of money but may meet with many problems,"" Tang said. ""You might not even get your baby back."" Tang and his wife are part of an increasing number of Chinese couples who are turning to surrogacy services. Tang also considered surrogacy in Thailand but dropped the idea after recent reports about a baby with Down Syndrome who was delivered through surrogacy and said to have been deserted in Thailand by the biological parents from Australia. Instead, Tang chose the California Surrogacy Center agency as his first option after reading the detailed introduction on its website. Compared with many other agencies that he could contact only via e-mail, the center has a consulting office in Beijing, Tang said. The center is in San Diego, California, and has satellite offices in Los Angeles and Beijing. According to Liu, the center has been operating for more than eight years, and about 100 surrogate mothers live in California."	['gives birth to a baby for another woman']
How did the writer feel about his mum after she told him everything?	Bags of Love Last year, I worked in a middle school near my mother's house, and I stayed with her for a month. During that time, I helped her do some housework and buy some food. After the first week, I noticed that the food was eaten up very quickly. Then I began keeping an eye on my mum. To my surprise, I found that she would put some of the food into a paper bag and go out with it at about nine every morning. And finally, I decided to follow her. I saw her taking the food to the street children. She would also spend a lot of time talking and playing with them. One day, I talked to a neighbour and found out that my mum was well-known in the area. The children were very friendly with her and even thought of her as their own mother. Then it hit me - why wouldn't she want to tell me about it? Was she worried that I would stop buying food if I found out? When my mum got home, I gave her a big hug .I told her she didn't need to keep it a secret from me. And she told me something about the children. Some of them lived with an old lady in a small house. Others slept on the street. For years, she was helping the poor street children by giving them food. After she told me everything, I was so moved by how selfless she was. She helped others in need. As her son, I was so proud of my mum. I continued to buy food for my mum after that. But I always added one more bag for her other children.	['He was proud of her.']
Why do the tourists give fewer tips?	"It's generally thought to be impolite not to give waiters some money as a tip after getting good services in western countries. However, hard economic times mean tourists are giving fewer tips, according to a survey . As many as one third of holidaymakers are giving smaller tips or have stopped tipping entirely, the survey by TripAdvisor found. Also, only 46% of British always know what is expected in the way of tips in other countries. The survey of 5,595 travellers, including 1,197 from the UK, showed that 41% of European travellers were tipping less or not at all this year. A total of 63% of European travellers knew how to tip in other countries, with Italians coming first. The survey also showed that 29% of British tended to give the same amount in tips whatever country they were in. As many as 8% of British said they had had a holiday ruined by a bad tipping experience, while 16% said they they had been once in a situaiton where the waiter complained about the amount of the tip. Also, 12% of British said tipping on holiday made them nervous, while 22% said _ . TripAdvisor spokeswoman Emma Shaw said: ""It's been a challenging year for the British economy and Brits are spending very carefully. While the majority are still rewarding good service on holidays with tips, many Brits are giving smaller tips as cost-saving continues to be important."""	['They are suffering from tough economy.']
"What did the ""blue box"" do?"	"When Steven was a young boy, he moved quite often with his family and so he never had many friends. He spent a lot of time on his own and liked to play with electronic things. Steven had a neighbour, Steve Wozniak. Steve was a little bit younger than Steven but also liked to play with electronic things. Steven made a microphone and Steve asked him many questions about it until he understood how it worked. Steven liked the fact that such a young boy was also interest ed in electronic things and so he taught him everything he knew. When they were a little older and knew more about electronic things, they made a ""blue box"". People could make free phone calls by breaking into the phone company's system with this box. They sold this to many people even though it was illegal , but this is not why they are famous today. Steven and Steve were the inventors of the first PC--personal computer. They called their first computer the Apple I. They invented it only for fun and to make themselves known among their friends. They did not think it would become so popular. They just liked playing computer games on it. Their computer made it cheaper and easier for people to own and use a computer. Their PCs were so popular that they made a new PC called the Apple II. Soon many schools, families and factories were using their computers. Without the two clever men, the personal computers might never have appeared."	['It helped people make free phone calls.']
According to Professor Kraemer, the major problem in cloning pandas would be the lack of _ .	"With only about 1, 000 pandas left in the world, China is desperately trying to clone the animal and save the endangered species . That's a move similar to what a Texas A & M University researchers have been undertaking for the past five years in a project called ""Noah's Ark"". Noah's Ark is aimed at collecting eggs, embryos , semen and DNA of endangered animals and storing them in liquid nitrogen . If certain species should become extinct, Dr. Duane Kraemer, a professor in Texas A & M's College of Veterinary Medicine, says there would be enough of the basic building blocks to reintroduce the species in the future. It is estimated that as many as 2,000 species of mammals, birds reptiles will become extinct in over 100 years. The panda, native only to China, is in danger of becoming extinct in the next 25 years. This week, Chinese scientists said they grew an embryo by introducing cells from a dead female panda into the egg cells of a Japanese white rabbit. They are now trying to implant the embryo into a host animal. The entire procedure could take from three to five years to complete. ""The nuclear transfer of one species to another is not easy, and the lack of available(capable of being used) panda eggs could be a major problem,"" Kraemer believes. ""They will probably have to do several hundred transfers to result in one pregnancy (having a baby). It takes a long time and it's difficult, but this could be groundbreaking science if it works. They are certainly not putting any live pandas at risk, so it is worth the effort,"" adds Kraemer, who is one of the leaders of the Project at Texas A& M, the first-ever attempt at cloning a dog. ""They are trying to do something that's never been done, and this is very similar to our work in Noah's Ark. We're both trying to save animals that face extinction. I certainly appreciate their effort and there's a lot we can learn from what they are attempting to do. It's a research that is very much needed. """	['available panda eggs']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"Think stars don't move? Think again! When you look at the sky at night, the stars may appear to stay in the same place. But stars are always on the move--they are just so far away that the movement is hard to see. But some stars move in ways that appear to be strange to be real. In 2005, astronomer Warren Brown found one of these space oddities . It was located on the outer edge of the Milky Way, the galaxy we live in. The star was speeding away like nothing he'd ever seen. ""It seemed unbelievable. No star in the galaxy has a speed like that,"" Brown remembers. ""I thought, oh my goodness, I have something kind of special here."" No one had ever seen a star like this one. What does a scientist do when the results don't make sense? Brown didn't give up. Instead, he kept looking. And he kept finding more of these strange and speedy stars, called _ stars. Hyper means ""above"" and velocity has to do with speed. He and his team just found six more of these ""above speed"" stars, bringing to the total of 16. And, he says, he's found even more, and is just waiting for the scientific community to confirm them."

How did Sarah's mom feel about her school three months ago?	This is an interview between the reporter and Sarah, a girl who created a website for her school. Reporter: Why did you start this new website for Alcott Middle School? Sarah: Three months ago, my mom was complaining about how she never hears about the days our school ends early until after the fact. She works late and sometimes she has to ask our neighbor at the last minute to pick me up after school. It happened several times, and she was frustrated that there wasn't better notification from the school. Reporter: Didn't your school already have a website with that information? Sarah: We had a website. But there wasn't much information on it, and nobody was _ keeping it up-to-date . I asked my teacher if our class could update the school calendar. That seemed pretty easy. Reporter: Was it? Sarah: Yeah, and it was kind of fun. So then we asked the principal if we could redo the whole site. He said okay, so we went to work. We discovered websites that taught us how to make our site look better and added more hot links that people could click to get more information about a subject. We posted photos from basketball games. Our class even started a blog about what's going on at school. Then we persuaded the teachers to create their own pages. Reporter: So what's next? Sarah: A few friends and I started a small Web design business. We're asking other schools if they'll employ us to set up a site like the one we created. Reporter: Wow! That's pretty enterprising for a 13-year-old. Sarah: I guess so. But it doesn't seem like work when you're doing something you enjoy.	['Dissatisfied.']

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"A teacher showed three toys to his students and asked them to find out the differences. All the three toys seemed to have the same shape, size and material. After looking at them carefully, the students discovered holes in the toys. The first toy had holes in the ears. The second toy had holes in its ear and mouth. The third toy had only one hole in one of its ears. Then the teacher put a needle in one ear hole of the first toy. The needle came out of the other ear. For the second toy, when the needle was put in its ear , it came out of its mouth. And for the third toy, when the needle was put in, it did not come out. So the teacher explained to his students,"" The first toy represent those people who seem to be listening to you and caring for you. But they are just pretending to do so. After listening, as the needle comes out from the next ear, the things you said to them are gone. In fact, they don't care for you at all."" ""The second toy represents those people who listen to you and care for you. But as in the toy, the needle comes out from mouth, these people will use what you tell them to fight against you. They tell others what you said and tell your secrets for their purposes."" ""As for the third toy, the needle does not come out. It represents those people who will keep the trust you put in them.

What is the author's attitude towards talking to a stranger?	It is said that most people have not more than 30 friends at any given time, and 400 over the whole of their lives. However, on social networking sites, most users have about 150 friends. If these numbers are correct, then friendship means different things in different situations. Also, there are no rules about friendship. There are no instructions about how to make friends, how to keep friendships going, and how to finish friendships if we want to move on. People have very different opinions about this: some people would die for their friends and they value them more than family. Others say that friends are temporary, only there to help each other until they are no longer needed. If people with such different views become friends, this can lead to problems. Because of these different definitions of friendship, it is easy to be unhappy about our friendships. We may want them to be deeper or closer, or we may want to have more friends in our lives. Sometimes we simply do not have the time to develop our friendships, or we fear we have left it too late in life to start. If we move to another country or city, we have to find ways to make new friends again. This dissatisfaction shows us how important friendships are for most of us. We should not think that it could be too late to build friendships. We also need to understand that the need to be around other people is one that is shared by many. Therefore, we should not be too frightened about starting to talk to people who in the future may become our friends: it is likely that they too would like to get closer to us. Remember what people say: strangers are friends we have not met yet.	['Positive.']
Which of the following is his novel?	"Jerome David Salinger was born in Manhattan on New Year s Day,1919.His father was a Jew.His mother was of Irish descent. Never much of a student attended the progressive McBurney School.But he left school after two years and in 1934was packed off to Valley Forge Military Academy.In 1937,after a couple of unenthusiastic weeks at New York University,he traveled with his father to Austraia and Poland,where father s plan for him was to learn the ham business.Deciding that wasn t for him.he returned to America and driturned to America and drifted through a term or so at Ursinus College.His most sustained exposure to higher education was an evening class he took at Columbia in 1939,and under Mr.Burnett s directions he managed to sell a stpry""The Young Folks""to Story magazine.He afterwards sold stories to Esquire,Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post.In 1941,after several rejections,Mr.Salinger finally cracked The New Yorker,with s story""Slight Rebellion Off Madison,""that was an earlu sketch of what became a scene in""The Catcher in the Rye<<>> . ""But the magazine then had second thoughts,apparently worried about seeming to encourage young people to run away from school and held the story for five years--a long time even for The New Yorker--before finally pubishing it in 1946,buried in the back of an issus. Meanwhile Mr.Salinger had been drafted and was stationef for a while in Tiverton,Devon,the setting of ""For Esme--with Love and Squalor,""probably the most deeply felt of the ""Nint Stories"".On June,6,1944,he landed at Utah Beach,and he later saw action during the Battle of the Bulge.In 1945 he was hospitalized for""battle breakdown""and after recovering he stayed on in Europe past the end of the war.He married a German woan doctor,very briefly."

It is implied in the passage that _ .	"When TV news programmers report wars or diseases, the editors rarely use the most horrifying pictures of dead or wounded victims because they don't want to upset their viewers. Even so, viewers are usually warned in advance that they""may find some of these scenes disturbing"", so they can look away if they choose. But the men and women whose job is to record those scenes, the TV cameramen, have no such choice. It is their duty to witness the horrors of the world and record them, no matter how unpleasant they may be. As a result, it is one of the most dangerous, exposed and emotionally _ jobs the world has to offer. Today, the demand for their work is rising. The explosion of satellite broadcasting and 24hour news in recent years has created an almost insatiable demand for TV information. But major broadcaster sand the TV news agencies , such as Reuters and WTN, have never had enough staff to meet thje worldwide demand for up-to-date pictures, so increasingly they turn to freelance TV cameramen. These freelance cameramen are independent operators tied to no particular organization. They will work for any company which hires them, for just a few hours or for several weeks in a war zone. But if the freelance cameraman is injured in the course of the job, the TV company is not responsible for him. The freelance must survive on his own. ""TV will always need hard, vivid and moving pictures which are fresh, but these companies feel uncomfortable with large numbers of employees on their books.""Explains Nik Cowing, once a foreign editor for Britain's Channel 4 news and now a BBC news presenter. ""By hiring freelancers, they can buy in the skills they need only when they need them. It also enables them to reduce the risk.""He says."

At the end of the passage, Mr. Rochester sounded _ .	"For several days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the morning he seemed much occupied with business, and in the afternoon gentlemen from the neighborhood called and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his foot was well enough, he rode out a great deal,and all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house, when he would sometimes pass me coldly, and sometimes bow and smile. His changes of manner did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them. One evening, several days later, I was invited to talk to Mr. Rochester after dinner. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes were bright, probably with wine. As I was looking at him, he suddenly turned, and asked me, ""Do you think I'm handsome, Miss Eyre?"" The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it: ""No, sir."" ""Ah, you really are unusual! You are a quiet, serious little person, but you can be almost rude."" ""Sir, I'm sorry. I should have said that beauty doesn't matter, or something like that."" ""No, you shouldn't! I see, you criticize my appearance, and then you stab me in the back! You have honesty and feeling. There are not many girls like you."" I thought to myself that he might have too. He seemed to read my mind, and said quickly, ""Yes, you're right. I have plenty of faults. I went the wrong way when I was twenty-one, and have never found the right path again. I might have been as good as you, and perhaps wiser. I am not a bad man, take my word for it, but I have done wrong. It wasn't my character, but circumstances that were to blame. Why do I tell you all this? Because you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to, and because you're sympathetic and give them hope."" It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me. He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly, as was the case for the first time. ""Don't be afraid of me, Miss Eyre."" He continued, ""you don't relax or laugh very much, perhaps because of the effect Lowood school has had on you. But in time you will be more natural with me, and laugh, and speak freely. You're like a bird in a cage. When you get out of the cage, you'll fly very high."""	['encouraging']

When it is winter in China, _ .	"The word ""day"" has two meanings. When we talk about the number of days in a year, we are using ""day"" to mean 24 hours. But when we talk about day and night, we are using ""day"" to mean the time between sunrise and sunset. Since the earth looks like a ball, the sun can shine on only half of it at a time.

In the passage the writer watched _ .	"One windy spring day, I observed young people having fun using the wind to fly their kites. Multicolored creations of varying shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds dashing and dancing in the exciting atmosphere above the earth. As the strong winds gusted against the kites, a string kept them in check. Instead of blowing away with the wind, they arose against it to achieve great heights. They shook and pulled, but the controlling string and the clumsy tail kept them in tow , facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled and trembled against the string, they seemed to say, ""Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!"" They flew beautifully even as they fought the forced restriction of the string. Finally, one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. ""Free at last,"" it seemed to say. ""Free to fly with the wind."" Yet freedom from control simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic gentle wind. It flew ungracefully to the ground and landed in a twisted mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. ""Free at last"". Free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be blown helplessly along the ground, and to settle down lifeless against the first roadblock. How much like kites we sometimes are. There always exist misfortunes and restrictions, rules to follow from which we can grow and gain strength. Prohibition is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition. Some of us pulled at the rules so hard that we never fly fast to reach the heights we might have obtained. If we keep all the commandment , we will never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground. Let us each rise to the great heights, recognizing that some of the prohibitions are actually the steady force that helps us climb and achieve."	['many young people flying multicolored kites']
Insurance companies focus on female driver clients probably because they _ .	"People always think men are more skilled than women in driving. Nowadays women appear to have a positive image of themselves as safer drivers than men. In a survey done for insurer MetLife, 51% of women said they drive more safely. The evidence is on their side: Men are 3.4 times more likely than women to get a ticket for careless driving and 3.1 times as likely to be punished for drunk driving. ""Women are on average less aggressive and more law abiding drivers, which leads to fewer accidents."" the report says. However, not all male drivers share the same opinion. Of the men surveyed by MetLife, 39% claimed male drivers were safer. The findings did back them up on one point: automotive knowledge. The report showed that more men are familiar with current safety equipment such as electronic stability control, which helps prevent rollover accidents. Auto safety unavoidably matters to money. Insurance companies focus on what classes of drivers have the lowest dollar amounts of claims, and for now, that mainly includes women. In general, women pay about 9% less for auto insurance than men. A study by the website Insweb also showed that auto insurance rates are lower for women in most states. Among individual states, women get the greatest advantage in Wyoming (where they pay 20% less), South Dakota and Washington, D. C., where their insurance costs are 16% lower. ""More than 11,900 male drivers died in U.S. traffic accidents in 2009, compared with just under 4,900 women drivers,"" according to the study. ""Based on miles traveled, men died at a rate of 2.5 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, v.s. 1.7 deaths for women."""	['are more careful drivers and cause less damage']
"According to the passage, the concept of ""opportunity cost"" is applied to _ ."	"However wealthy we may be, we can never find enough hours in the day to do everything we want. Economics deals with this problem through the concept of opportunity cost, which simply refers to whether someone's time or money could be better spent on something else. Every hour of our time has a value. For every hour we work at one job we could quite easily be doing another, or be sleeping or watching a film. Each of these options has a different opportunity cost--namely, what they cost us in missed opportunities. Say you intend to watch a football match but the tickets are expensive and it will take you a couple of hours to get to and from the stadium. Why not, you might reason, watch the game from home and use the _ money and _ to have dinner with friends? This--the alternative use of your cash and time--is the opportunity cost. For economists, every decision is made by knowledge of what one must forgo--in terms of money and enjoyment--in order to take it up. By knowing precisely what you are receiving and what you are missing out on, you ought to be able to make better-informed, more reasonable decisions. Consider that most famous economic rule of all: there's no such thing as a free lunch. Even if someone offers to take you out to lunch for free, the time you will spend in the restaurant still costs you something in terms of forgone opportunities. Some people find the idea of opportunity cost extremely discouraging: imagine spending your entire life calculating whether your time would be better spent elsewhere doing something more profitable or enjoyable. Yet, in a sense it's human nature to do precisely that--we assess the advantages and disadvantages of decisions all the time. In the business world, a popular phrase is ""value for money."" People want their cash to go as far as possible. However, another is fast obtaining an advantage: ""value for time."" The biggest restriction on our resources is the number of hours we can devote to something, so we look to maximize the return we get on our investment of time. By reading this passage you are giving over a bit of your time which could be spent doing other activities, such as sleeping and eating. In return, however, this passage will help you to think like an economist, closely considering the opportunity cost of each of your decisions."	['weighing the choice of opportunities']
What's the best title of the passage?	"Finding time to enjoy life is becoming harder and harder. As the average workweek lengthens, leisure time drops. Yet some of the world's busiest people are able to develop rewarding careers and also make time for family and leisure activities. Here is their best advice plus that of time-management experts: 1. Use your peak hours wisely. People tend to be most alert in late morning and midevening. Afternoon brings an increase in sleepiness. Use your high-efficiency hours to handle difficult jobs or engage in creative thinking. For low-efficiency times, concentrate on cleaning up or sorting your mail. By adapting to your mental condition, you can accomplish more in less time. 2. Make a plan. Just 20 minutes of organizing can save an hour of extra effort remembering what must be done. ""Don't try to carry your life around in your head,"" says Lucy Hedrick, author of Five Days to an Organized Life. ""Write things down so you can free your brain for more inventive pursuit ."" 3. Discourage drop-ins. The person who welcomes every visitor will get plenty of conversation but won't accomplish much. The trick is to develop harmless ways to protect yourself from minute-stealing interruptions. David E. Levy, a public-relations consultant , uses an alternative to the open-door policy by keeping his door half open. The message is clear: he really doesn't want you to come in, but you can if it is important. 4. Tame the telephone. Few devices save more minutes--or waste so many more--than the telephone. Signal the end of your conversation with a phrase such as ""Before we hang up..."" You can save even more time by not taking every incoming call. Keep a record of when people you call regularly are least busy and call them at those times. Even better, make appointments to call important contacts. To help us gain an extra hour every day, a clockmaker in Dallas has created a timer measuring each minute at 57.6 seconds. The 2.5 seconds borrowed from each minute add up to an extra 60 minutes at the end of each day."	['Gain an Extra Hour Every Day']
Someone hears and writes English very well, but he speaks it very badly. This is because _ .	"In order to know a foreign language thoroughly , four things are necessary. First, we must understand the language when we hear it spoken. Secondly, we must be able to speak it ourselves, correctly with confidence and without hesitation . Thirdly, we must be able to write it. We must be able to make sentences that are correct in grammar. There is no short way to succeed in language learning. A good memory is a great help, but it is not enough only to memorize the rules from a grammar book. It is no much use learning by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on. We must learn by using the language. If we are pleased with a few rules we have memorized, we are not really learning the language. We must ""Learn through use"". Practice is important. We must practise speaking and writing the language whenever we can."	['he often hesitates to practise speaking it']
Why is Justin's room such a mess? WWW.K**S*858$$U.COM	"Justin's bedroom was so full of flat bicycle tires, bent tennis rackets, deflated basketballs, and games with missing pieces that you could barely get in the door. His parents _ him to clean out his room. ""What use is a fish tank with a hole in the bottom?"" his father asked. But Justin simply smiled and repeated his motto, ""Never throw anything out, you never know when it might come in handy."" When Justin was away from home, he always carried his blue backpack--a smaller version of his bedroom--a place to store the many objects that he collected. It was so worn and stretched that it hardly resembled a backpack anymore. Justin had earned a reputation for figuring things out and getting people out of otherwise hopeless situations. Many of his classmates and neighbors sought him out when they needed help with a problem. On the first day of school, his friend Kenny, came looking for Justin. ""Do you think you have something in your bag that could help me remember my locker combination?"" he asked. ""I lost the piece of paper it was written on. I have a science class in two minutes and if I'm late on the first day it'll make me look bad for the rest of the year."" Kenny looked really worried. ""Relax,"" Justin said, taking his backpack off and unzipping the top. ""Remember how you borrowed my notebook in homeroom to write the combination down? Well, I know how we can recover what you wrote."" He took the notebook and a soft lead pencil out of his bag. The page that Kenny had written on had left faint marks on another page in the notebook. Justin held the pencil on its side and rubbed it lightly over the marks. Slowly but surely the numbers of the locker combination appeared in white, set off by the gray pencil rubbings. ""That's amazing!"" Kenny said. ""I owe you one."" And he dashed off to open his locker. It was just another day in the life of the boy whose motto was ""Never throw anything out, you never know when it might come in handy."""	['He never throws anything away.']
Deng went to school _ .	"Do you know the late leader of China, Deng Xiaoping? He was called the""chief architect of China's reform and opening-up "". August 22 is the 110 anniversary of his birth. President Xi Jinping held an important meeting for the event on August 20 , 2014 in Beijing. Senior leaders Li Keqiang, Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the event. Deng was born on Aug, 22, 1904 in the southwest China's Sichuan Province. He also had the name Deng Xiaosheng. His father , Deng Wenming , was a middle-level landowner . His mother died early in Deng's life. He has three brothers and three sisters. Deng's first wife , one of his schoolmates from Moscow , died when she was 24, a few days after giving birth to Deng's first child, a baby girl, who also died. His second wife left him in 1933. His third wife, Zhuo Lin, was the daughter of an industrialist in Yunnan Province. She married him in 1939 in Yan'an. They had five children:three daughters and two sons. Deng was sent to private primary school at the age of five. In the summer of 1919, Deng Xiaoping graduated from the Chongqing School. Then he went to study and work in France in the 1920s. His father strongly supported him, the night before going to France, Deng's father took his son aside and asked him what he hoped to learn there. He repeated the words he had learned from his teachers:""To learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China.""He joined the Communist Party of China in 1924. In late 1927 , Deng left Moscow to return to China. He joined the army to save China. He died on February 19 , 1997."	['in 1909']
The main point of the passage is _ .	"Back in old times, people had little knowledge about the universe and nature. Things we now consider to be common sense were mysteries to our ancestors. Over the years, major breakthroughs have been made in science and many phenomena have been explained. But still, there are always questions we can't yet answer, and The Guardian has listed some of them. 1. What makes us human? Just looking at your DNA won't tell you - human DNA is 99 percent _ to that of the chimpanzee and, believe it or not, 50 percent identical to a banana's! A lot of the things we once thought were unique about us - language and tool use, recognizing ourselves in the mirror and so on - have since been seen in other animals. Perhaps it's our culture that makes the difference or maybe our ability to use fire. It's also possible that our capacity for co-operation and our trading skills are what make us unique. 2. Why do we dream? Given the fact that we spend around a third of our lives sleeping, shouldn't we know everything about it? Unfortunately, scientists are still searching for a complete explanation of what happens when we sleep and why we dream. Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud believed dreams were the expressions of wishes that we can't fulfill in our real lives. Others have wondered whether dreams are just random ""noise"" coming from a sleeping brain. 3. Could we someday live forever? Apart from accidents, most people die because of diseases that can be treated and aging. And since many diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, are diseases of aging, treating aging itself could be the key to extending our lives. Our knowledge of what causes us to age - and what allows some animals to live longer than others - is expanding rapidly. And though we haven't quite worked out all the details, we've worked out some pieces of the puzzles such as DNA damage and metabolism , which are all leading to the invention of drugs that can slow down the aging process. If we're lucky enough to lengthen our lives, we might even get to see the day when all of these questions are answered."	"[""to present some questions we can't yet answer""]"
What is the true reason for Western doctors to turn to the ancient wisdom of the East ?	"Not long ago, many doctors in the West laughed at the suggestion that they might learn something from traditional Asian systems of healing. Most of them thought that Asian herbal medicine and acupuncture were believed in only by simple people who knew no better. Western doctors relied mainly on chemical cures as the safest and surest way to treat illnesses. The scientific age of antibiotics , ""miracle drugs"" and heart transplants encouraged the public to believe that there must be a pill for every illness. It was true that often the drug companies provided what the public wanted: a speedy temporary cure and did not remove the real cause of the illness. Moreover, some people actually became ill through taking too much medicine. Many people in the West are now beginning to look for more natural cures for their illnesses and often they turn to the ancient wisdom of the East. There are some doctors in Britain now who offer their patients acupuncture treatment. Recently an Indian company which produces a natural medicine based on the biba root has sold some to Germany. The World Health Organization(WHO) encourages doctors not to rely too greatly on expensive Western medicines but to choose them carefully and also use their traditional herbal cures. The mixture of Eastern and Western medicine has been practiced very successfully in China. China is still the only country in the world where the traditional doctor using herbal medicine and acupuncture is as respected as the Western-trained doctor. Through China all types of doctors are expected to work together. Western-style doctors are required to take at least a one-year course in traditional medicine, and the acupunctures must also study the basics of western medicine. China's way of ""having the best of both worlds"" has greatly impressed many visiting doctors from the West. Experts from the WHO have decided that the time has come to study herbal medicine very carefully and to decide, by carefully controlled scientific experiments, what good these medicine might do. They are especially interested in finding cures for illnesses which Western medicine has found ""incurable"". Six WHO units have been set up in Hong Kong, Seoul, Sri Lanka, London and Chicago, and so far the results have been encouraging."	['All of the above.']
A new network system was set up to _ .	"Everyday we talk about and use the Internet, but how many of us know the history of the Internet? Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer network didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working on the time. At first the Internet was only used by the government, but in the early 1970s, universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still very expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software that made ""surfing"" in the Internet more convenient. Today it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among students.The Internet has now become one of the most important parts of people's life."	['make itself keep on working all the time']
What is the text mainly about?	"In recent years,American students have fallen behind in many subjects like math,science and reading. In 2005,the U.S. was number nine among the developed countries in the number of students graduating from high school. American education officials are searching for new ways to help students learn again. One tool that is getting some attention is the use of video games. Sixteenyearold John Diaz says he loves playing video games but doesn't like traditional schoolwork. During his summer vacation,Diaz is continuing his studies at home. That is because his courses are available on his home computer. Florida Virtual School's head master,Julie Young,says the school teaches students with the technology they most enjoy using in and out of school.""We have so many students who feel free in our school,"" Young said, ""They lose interest when they go to school. And we're very hopeful that Conspiracy Code will attract the learners to really get into the detail of learning."" Conspiracy Code is a video game that teaches U.S. history.

According to the passage, people's response to the project is _ .	"Does your local town have a nickname? If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there? Many cities are recognized across the world by their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land. Now, as part of English Language Day on Wednesd ay, two British organizations, the English Project and Ordnance Survey, are launching an interactive project which aims to identify the nicknames which people use in their daily lives for the places which they like or dislike. ""The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,"" explains Winchester University's Professor Bill Lucas, a patron of the English Project. ""So Basingstoke becomes Amazingstoke; Swindon is known as Swindump and Padstow, hometown of chef Rick Stein, is nicknamed Padstein."" Basingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area. Swindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump ( ). Stanford Le Hope in Essex is called Stanford No Hope by locals. And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein. Since launching the online survey last week, the creators have already received 3,000 alternative titles for places and landmarks. As well as creating what promises to be a fascinating resource of nicknames, there is a practical side to the project. ""With the huge variety of place nicknames that exist, we could never hope to collect them all ourselves,"" says Glen Hart, Ordnance Survey's head of research. ""But the information from the project could prove vital. Organizations like the emergency services rely on our information when responding to 999 calls, so by having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly locate the right place, and maybe even save lives."""

Which of the following old sayings shows the writer's opinion about learning fashion design?	"One of the most exciting and attractive fields of work today is the fashion industry. Some of the most well-known people in this industry are the fashion designers with unbelievable financial Kingdoms. But most of the clothes that you wear have been designed by people that the world has never heard of. Although these unknown fashion designers will never make a very large amount of money as their famous workmates, most still would not think of changing their careers. They are doing what they love. If you spend hours looking through fashion magazines and like making your own clothes, a career as a fashion designer might be right for you. You do not have to go to design school to become a fashion designer, but many people who want a career in this field do. One of the most famous places to study is the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. It is located in the heart of the ""garment"" district on Eighth Avenue, also known as Fashion Avenue. Becoming a fashion designer is not just a matter of classroom education. Students know that they cannot just leave school and start designing on their own. Many think that they need at least four years' experience working for someone else after they graduate. The best schools encourage students to work closely with the fashion industry while they are still studying. You need ambition and hard work to get a career in fashion. Students often work 12 hours a day. They are encouraged to have realistic ambitions and not to expect success overnight, if ever. Success means finding a job in the fashion industry and more years of hard work."	['Experience is the best teacher.']

I wanted to make some new friends. However, I was shy and wasn't good at making new friends. On my first day at school, I looked at others who were talking in groups happily. How I wish I were one of them! I guess I was very lucky then. At lunch in the dinning hall, when I was eating at a table alone, a girl came to me. ""Excuse me, is this seat taken?"" she asked.

The French have long holidays. They like travelling and usually spend their long time in other countries. The French are more outgoing than the Germans. It is very easy to make friends with them. Compared to (......) the French, the Americans are more outgoing. And they are even opener. They don't like to depend on others. So it is very popular that students do part-time jobs.

How did the old man stop Nian from eating people?	"Every country has its traditional festivals. The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means ""year"", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, ""I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?"" ""Yes,"" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to ""Guo Nian"". The word ""Guo Nian"" means ""go through the Nian safely"". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable."	['By talking to him.']
"What does Oprah Winfrey mean by saying ""I did it""?"	"Oprah Winfrey is not just a very successful TV personality in the US, she is also a woman who has encouraged millions. For those people, her life and her success are a good example. She has struggled with many of the challenges that we all face, and she has changed her life. Her message is powerful: I did it, and so can you. Oprah Winfrey is a black woman whose becoming famous is an encouraging story. She was born on January 29, 1954 in a small village in America. Her patents were very poor. For her family, life seemed to hold no promise. But there was nothing that could stop Oprah. She was an extremely bright girl at school. She asked her kindergarten teacher to let her go to school sooner and she also skipped the second grade of primary school . Her life from the age of six till about fourteen was very hard. For many women such difficulty would be too heavy to bear . But not for Oprah. When she was fourteen, Oprah went to live with her father. Her father showed her how hard work and discipline could lead to self-improvement. Oprah listened to her father, and a few years later she won a college scholarship that allowed her to go to university. Two years later, after graduation, she started working for television. For more than ten years she worked for different TV stations across the country. In 1984, she moved to Chicago, where she became the host of a talk show called ""AM Chicago"". When Oprah started, ""AM Chicago"" had few listeners. By September of the next year, the show was so successful that it was given a new name: 'The Oprah Winfrey Show"". Oprah Winfrey's story encourages many people to believe that success and happiness in life are within reach for everyone."	['I managed to over come  the challenges.']

She started climbing near her home in Paris when she was five. Then, at fourteen, she joined the French Alpine Club to learn more, but immediately she climbed better and more quickly than the older members of the club. She won her first competition in Italy in 1995. Three years ago she found a new route up the Dru Mountain near Chamonix.

Both the two boys think a lady should be _	"Do your parents ever say ""do it like a lady"" or ""be a gentleman"" to you? But in the eyes of today's students, what should a lady or a gentleman be like? Let's take a look. What is a gentleman? _ ? _ : A gentleman doesn't always get angry . He wants others to be well and happy. He's always ready to help others. There is a boy in my class I think he is a gentleman. If I don't do well in the English exam, he will say ""You will do better next time"". That makes me feel happy. _ : A gentleman always says, ""Ladies first"". When students clean the classroom, he always does heavy work. He lets girls go into rooms first. There are no gentlemen in my class. When there is something to eat, the boys in my class always get them before girls! What is a lady? Boys tell us what they think a lady is: _ : A lady is kind and quiet ,but she's not shy and she can talk about her ideas in front of others. To me, Dong Jie, a film star, is a lady. She is pretty and kind. She does a lot for others. _ : A lady is not just beautiful but clever. She never says bad words. She is quiet and kind to others. I don't think there is a lady in my class.

Who usually act as the teachers in the 50 Plus Center?	When people imagine a classroom, they usually think of older people teaching younger ones. But when it comes to learning about high-technology devices, the opposite can often be true. A training program called the 50 Plus Center in the eastern American city of Columbia, Maryland offers free technology classes to adults over 50. The training program also offers many other kinds of lectures from Qigong and Tai Chi to yoga and Latin jam dance. There are a lot of exercise programs including playing cards and physical exercises where many people just relax and spend some time together. Myra Stafford is 73 years old. She signed up for the class to learn how to use her iPad. She is learning quickly with the help of the young and she enjoys learning from them. She says she is more confident today than she was before. Working with young people makes her feel wonderful because they don't make her feel that she is old or dumb. Eleven-year-old Zhion Perekins is a teacher of the technology class. He says some of the older adults know nothing about high-technology devices and they are very anxious, so patience is very important when working with them. He gains more than just social skills from teaching older residents. He has learned a lot on how to communicate with people. He used to be a shy person, but now he has become outgoing. There is a huge growing population over 60. The training program offers an opportunity for the old people to buy products online using high-technology devices. As senior citizens get more excited about what they want to buy, it is likely that they will go into the market and buy it, so that could lead to an increase in economy.	['The young.']
This passage is probably taken from _ .	"In the near future,we may be using our eyes to operate our smart-phones and tablets,even when it comes to playing popular games like Fruit Ninja. The Gaze Group has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years.But those devices have been firstly designed to help those with disabilities,and are very expensive. ""After a while,we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market way,"" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen.""where everybody would have this available."" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company,the Eye Tribe,which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works with the help of the computing device toward the user's face. After making sure of the user's eye movements,the technology is then able to easily find where a person's eyes are moving,and then allow the eyes to control a cursor . ""Our software can then determine the location of the eyes and know where you're looking on the screen to make sure what you're looking at,""reads an explanation on the Eye Tribe site. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world.Recently Xbox released the Kinect device,which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands,legs and voices. But still,most of these devices have been more of a _ than a practical way to use one's hands to control a mobile device.Johansen said a replaceable filter would be a cheap,convenient way for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create such a product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for physically disabled users.

Vitamin supplements are popular with people because _ .	Now, we know that if we do not get enough vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. As a result, vitamin supplements ,though expensive, are popular with people who worry that they are not getting enough vitamins from the foods they eat. But contrary to what many people think, medical experts have found little evidence that most supplements do anything to improve health or protect against disease. In fact, medical experts warn that taking too many of some vitamins can be harmful. For example, too much vitamin E can cause bleeding. People should discuss what vitamins they take with their doctors, as some vitamins can produce harmful side effects when mixed with medicines. Experts, however, do say that sometimes vitamins can help prevent disease. People who know they lack a particular vitamin should take vitamin supplements. Some older adults, for example, may not have enough vitamin B-twelve. This is because, as people get older, their body loses its ability to take it from foods. Also, people who spend much time inside may need some extra vitamin D as the skin makes this vitamin from sunlight. Different vitamins are found in different foods. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil. It also is in the yellow part of eggs. Sweet potatoes, carrots and other darkly color1ed fruits and vegetables contain substances that the body can change into vitamin A. Vitamin B-twelve is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, like fruits. Vitamin K can be found in pork products. In fact, for most people, a balanced diet can ensure enough of the vitamins our bodies need. So, it is important for us to eat a mixture of foods every day to ensure that we get enough vitamins our bodies need.	['people fear that a lack of vitamins will lead to disease']
When did many couples feel happier according to the study?	"Marriages improve after children grow up and move out,according to an academic study, which suggests an ""empty nest"" is not always a bad thing. Popular wisdom has it that parents' relationships may suffer once their young fly the coop, because they feel they have lost their purpose in life.However, a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that many couples actually feel happier when their children leave home because they are able to enjoy spending time together. In total,123 American mothers born in the 1930s were tracked for 18 years and asked to rate their satisfaction levels shortly after marrying, when they were bringing up babies, once their children reached their teenage years and finally at age 61, when almost all had ""empty nests"". Although not all said they were happier in general, most claimed their marriages had improved since their children had left home. Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses were spending more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more. One of the participants in the study,which is published in the journal Psychological Science,said:""Once the kids grow up...there's some of that stress removed...that responsibility removed,so things are a little more relaxed."" Psychologist Sara Gorchoff,who carried out the investigation,said: ""The takehome message for couples with young children is 'hang in there'."" Her coauthor Oliver John added:""Don't wait until your kids leave home to schedule quality time with your partner."" However, Dr Dorothy Rowe,from the British Psychological Society,said the effects of living in an ""empty nest"" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children.""If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life,then of course you'll be pleased to see them go,"" she said, ""But if you've built your life around your children you'll be terribly lonely.For some parents,their world falls apart when their children leave."""

What might be the most suitable title for the passage?	"Let's face it: Teenagers spend hours texting, socializing on Facebook and playing video games.And it's driving their parents nuts. Sure, there are real dangers connected with all this screen time--everything from cyberbullying to couch-potato obesity.Not to mention driving while texting, and shortened attention spans . Douglas Gentile, who studies the effects of media on children, says texting, Facebook and video games are not naturally bad.Nor are they naturally better or worse than watching TV, although they do lead to different risks, such as cyberbullying. But research has shown that the more time kids spend in front of screens--whether it's TV or instant-messaging--the worse their school performances are.""That doesn't mean it's true for every kid, but it makes sense, that for every hour a kid is playing video games, it's an hour that they're not doing homework or reading or exploring or creating,"" he said.If screen time is taking the place of doing their homework, that's bad.But if their homework is done, well, so what? The study also found that the more time kids spend with media, the lower their grades and levels of personal satisfaction are.Gentile said the influence of screen time on school work can be reduced by what he calls ""protective factors"".Those might include good teachers and a high-performing school, love of reading, coming from a family where education is valued.""If you had all these protective factors, then that one little risk factor, who cares?"" One thing parents should worry about is the way electronic devices encourage multitasking . ""As adults, your response speeds up, you're quicker to look over your shoulder and notice little noises or lights.However this is not what the kids need when they get to the classroom.Scanning to see when the next message comes may not be good for kids.The more distractions you have, the worse your performance is.""

The writer tries to make us believe that _ .	"One day,Mr.Arnold was teaching a lesson,and things were going as normally as ever.He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils.He told them that,in the beginning,men were nomads ;they never stayed in the same place for very long.Instead,they would travel about,here and there,in search of food,wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up: ""And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?"" Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl.He knew that she lived with her parents in a house,so she must know that her family were not nomads;so what did she mean? ""We have all become nomads again,"" continued Lucy.""The other day,outside the city,they were cutting the forest down. A while ago a fisherman told me how they fish.It's the same with everyone:when there's no more forest left, the foresters go elsewhere,and when the fish run out, the fishermen move on.That's what the nomads did,isn't it?"" The teacher nodded,thoughtfully. Really,Lucy was right. Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs,we kept developing it until the land was bare.And then off we would go to the next place! The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to show how to be more civilized. The next day everyone attended class wearing a green Tshirt,with a message that said,""I am not a nomad!"" And,from then on,they set about showing that indeed they were not.Every time they knew they needed something,they made sure that they would get it using care and control.If they needed wood or paper,they would make sure that they got the recycled kind.They ordered their fish from fish farms,making sure that the fish they received were not too young and too small.They only used animals that were well cared for,and brought up on farms. And so,from their little town,those children managed to give up being nomads again,just as prehistoric men had done so many thousands of years ago."

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Testing has taken the place of teaching in most public schools. Pretests, drills, tests, and retests. They know that the best way to read a textbook is to look at the questions at the end of the chapter and then read the text quickly for the answers. I believe that my daughter Erica, who gets excellent marks, has never read a chapter of any of her school textbooks all the way through. And teachers are often heard to say proudly and openly that they teach to the test. Teaching to the test is a curious phenomenon . Instead of deciding what skills students ought to learn, helping students learn them, and then using some methods of assessment to discover whether students have mastered the skills, teachers are encouraged to teach the students in the opposite way. First one looks at a test. Then one chooses the skills needed not to master reading, but to do well in the test. Finally, the test skills are taught. The ability to read or write might suggest the ability to do reasonably well on standardized tests. However, neither reading nor writing develops simply through being taught to take tests. We must be careful to avoid mistaking preparations for a test of a skill with the acquisition of that skill. Too many discussions of basic skills make this misunderstanding because people are tested rather than concerned with the nature and quality of what is taught. Recently, many schools have faced what could be called the crisis of comprehension or, in simple words, the phenomenon of students with grammar skills still being unable to understand what they read. These students are quite good at test taking and filling in workbooks. However, they have little or no experience reading or thinking, and talking about what they read. They know the details but can't see or understand the whole. They are taught to be so concerned with grades that they have no time to think about meaning, and reread things if necessary.

Which is the best title of the passage?	"Buying a house for most of the people is a once in a lifetime decision, which means people decide to do so only after coming across the ideal house. Surprisingly, eight in every 10 home buyers are unhappy with their houses. A survey conducted by the Beijing Consumers' Association (BCA) recently shows about 80 percent of the 2,315 respondents in 23 residential complexes of Beijing are dissatisfied with the soaring house prices. They think the reasonable price in Beijing should be between 3,000 yuan and 7,000 yuan per square meter. The quality of the buildings, the surrounding environment and traffic and property management are the other factors that play a role in people's decision to buy a house. The BCA has suggested strict sales regulations and contracts to ease house-owners' sufferings. It has urged the authorities to impose severe punishment on developers found violating building and other rules and joining hands with others to bid up property prices, About 41.2 percent of the respondents have complained that their house have defective designs, while nearly 40 percent say the lighting and ventilation are far from satisfactory. The landscapes in the residential areas are a source of unhappiness for 43.2 percent of the respondents, and about one-third say they were "" "" into buying ""third grade"" house. And more than half are not satisfied with the sport and entertainment facilities in their neighborhood. Property management in the buildings, 56.5 percent of the respondents say, is way below standard compared to the high fee charged by the complexes. 60 percent of the consumers doubt the contents of developers' advertisements, with only 6.3 percent being satisfied. Experts have suggested consumers gather thorough knowledge about a developer and their work before deciding to buy a house from it. They should check the day-light conditions and ventilation in different weather conditions in advance, if possible."	['Most Home Buyers Are Unhappy with Their House.']

Which of the following statements is NOT true?	Real policemen, both in Britain and the United States, hardly recognize any similarity between their lives and what they see on TV -- if they ever get home in time. There are similarities, of course, but the cops (policemen) don't think much of them. The first difference is that a policeman's real life revolves round (......) the law. Most of his training is in criminal law. He has to know exactly what actions are crimes and what evidence can be used to prove them in court. He has to know nearly as much law as a professional lawyer, and what is more, he has to apply it on his feet, in the dark and rain, running down an alley after someone he wants to talk to. Little of his time is spent in chatting to charming ladies or in dramatic confrontations with desperate criminals. He will spend most of his working life typing millions of words on thousands of forms about hundreds of sad, unimportant people who are guilty -- or not -- of stupid crimes of little importance. Most television crime drama is about finding the criminal: as soon as he's arrested, the story is over. In real life, finding criminals is seldom much of a problem. Except in very serious cases like murders and terrorist attacks-- where failure to produce results reflects on the standing of the police -- little effort is spent on searching. The police have detailed machinery which eventually shows up most wanted men. Having made an arrest, a detective really starts to work. He has to prove his case in court and to do that he often has to gather a lot of different evidence. Much of this has to be given by people who don't want to get involved in a court case. So, as well as being overworked, a detective has to be out at all hours of the day and night interviewing his witnesses and persuading them, usually against their own best interests, to help him. A third big difference between the drama detective and the real detective is that the real detective lives in an unpleasant moral twilight . Detectives tend to have two opposing pressures: first, as members of a police force they always have to behave with legality; secondly, as expensive public servants they have to get results. They can hardly ever do both. Most of the time, some of them have to break the rules in small ways. If the detective has to deceive the world, the world often deceives him. Hardly anyone he meets tells him the truth. And this separation the detective feels between himself and the rest of the world is deepened by the simplemindedness -- as he sees it -- of citizens, social workers, doctors, law-makers, and judges, who, instead of putting a complete end to crime punish the criminals less strictly in the hope that this will make them reform. The result, detectives feel, is that nine-tenths of their work is re-catching people who should have stayed behind bars. This makes them rather cynical .

According to the passage ,around the year1990 most women married _ .	The greatest recent changes have ,been in the lives of women ,During the twentieth century there was an unusual shortening of the time of a woman's life spent in caring for children. A woman marrying at the end of the 19th century would probably have been in her middle twenties ,and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived till they were five years old ,By the time the youngest was fifteen ,the mother would have been id her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years ,during which custom ,chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work, Today women marry younger and have fewer children Usually a woman 's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty Even while she has the care of children ,her work is lightened by household appliances and convenience foods. This important change in women's way of life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women' s economic position Even a few years ago most girls left school at the first opportunity and most of them took a full-time job However ,when they married ,they usually left work at once and never returned to it ,Today the school-leaving age is sixteen ,many girls stay at school after that age ,and though women tend to marry younger ,more married women stay at work at leas until shortly before their first child is born Very many more after wads ,return to full or part-time work Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage ,with both husband and wife accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfaction of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more e-qually in providing the money and running the home ,according to the abilities and inter-est of each them.

What can be inferred from the passage?	"SHANGHAI - Health experts in Shanghai are calling for more protection for young children as the latest research shows about half of the youngsters are suffering from secondhand smoke. About 45 percent of children suffer passive smoking in families, 50 percent in public places, and almost 6 percent on public transportation, shows a research released by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center on Tuesday. ""Not only adults but also children and newborn babies are at risk for the adverse effects of passive smoking,"" said Tang Jingyan, a doctor at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center. ""Actually, those young children whose bodies are still growing and developing are more sensitive to the effects of secondhand smoke."" Research has shown that children who are exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from more colds, coughs and sore throats, and they are more likely to suffer from bronchitis, pneumonia and will have a higher risk of developing cancer. Doctors even suggested that children suffering passive smoking are more likely to have behavioral problems and may not develop mentally as quickly as their peers. Other research by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has found that more than 80 percent of child patients in the center live in a smoke-filled household, where one or both parents smoke. ""Though doctors have stressed the harm of passive smoking over and over, it is still hard to reach a totally 'smoke free' home,"" said a pediatrician named Zhang Yiwen, noting that parents are often tempted to smoke even though they have learned the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. China has 540 million people suffering from passive smoke, 180 million of them younger than 15.The age of smokers is also getting lower, earlier reports said. ""There are more young smokers than before.You can see young people wearing a school uniform and carrying a schoolbag light a cigarette on the street.Some of them are even female students,"" said Jing Xingming, a professor of children's developmental behavior at the center. ""Children like to imitate adults, especially their parents.If parents often smoke at home, it is very likely children will develop a smoking habit, which can cause a vicious circle,"" Jin said. Reports from the Ministry of Health said China has about 350 million smokers, of whom 15 million are underage smokers.Also, around 40 million of the country's 130 million children aged between 13 and 18 had tried smoking, and 15 million had become addicted to tobacco."

Globally, Facebook has more than 500 million registered users, a milestone it hit last summer. Last July it had 26 million registered UK users. In the last eight months, it has attracted four million extra UK users, bringing the UK total to 30 million. Facebook, the brainchild of Mark Zuckerberg while he was still studying at Harvard University, was launched in February 2004. The pace of its global growth has sped rapidly - Facebook had only 150 million registered users in January 2009. One third of women aged between 18 to 34 check Facebook when they first wake up, before even going to the toilet, according to the research. 21% check Facebook in the middle of the night, while 42% of the same group think it is fine to post drunken photos of themselves onto the social network, a study by Oxygen Media and Lightspeed Research found. Shields was speaking this morning at the Financial Times Digital Media and Broadcasting Conference about the power Facebook's referrals can bring to media sites, such as newspapers and TV services. She explained that the average Facebook user has 130 friends who they share links to media sites with regularly.

Which of the following statements can we infer from the passage?	"A lot of us lose life's tough battles by starting a frontal attack--when a touch of humor might well enable us to win. Consider the case of a young friend of mine, who hit a traffic jam on his way to work shortly after receiving an ultimatum about being late on the job. Although there was a good reason for Sam's a being late--serious illness at home--he decided that this by-now-familiar excuse wouldn't work any longer. His supervisor was probably already pacing up and down preparing a dismissal speech. Yes, the boss was, Sam entered the office at 9:35. The place was as quiet as a locker room ; everyone was hard at work. Sam's supervisor came up to him. Suddenly, Sam forced a grin and stretched out his hand. ""How do you do!"" he said. ""I'm Sam Maynard. I'm applying for a job. Which, I understand, became available just 35 minutes ago. Does the early bird get the worm?"" The room exploded in laughter. The supervisor _ a smile and walked back to his office. Sam Maynard had saved his job--with the only tool that could win, a laugh. Humor is a most effective, yet frequently neglected , means of handling the difficult situations in our lives. It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying ""no"", criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face. For some jobs, it's the only tool that can succeed. It is a way to discuss subjects so sensitive that serious dialog may start a quarrel. For example, many believe that comedians on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other forum."	"[""It wasn't the first time that Sam came late for his work.""]"
We find the sun is _ than the moon because it is _ to us.	In the universe,as we all know,there is the sun,the moon,the earth and a good manystars.Through our geography lessons,we know the earth goes around the sun,and the moon goes around the earth.We have day and night because the earth keeps turning all the time.When our part of the earth turns to the sun,it is day.When our part of the earth turns away from the sun,it is night. Just because the moon is closer to the earth than the sun, it looks much bigger than the sun. Big things will look smaller when they are further, and small things also look bigger when they are nearer. The sun is big enough to give out very strong light. The moon can't give any light at all, but it looks quite bright, too. Why? In fact, the light from the moon comes from the sun. The moon looks much bigger and brighter than the stars. But actually the stars are much bigger and brighter than the moon.They look smaller than the moon also because they are further away from the earth. There are many other planets in the universe. But of all the planets, only on the earth there are living things and people can only live on the earth, too. But at 9:00 a.m. on October 15th,2003, Chinese pilot Yang Liwei was sent up to space. He stayed there for 21 hours.It was the first time for Chinese to get into space.	['smaller;farther']
The main purpose of this passage is to _ .	Whether you were the shy one at high school or the most popular person on campus, starting university is a clean paper for everyone. It's the best time to develop your skills with different people, such as teachers, classmates, and roommates. Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation. You can also take out your earphones when someone asks to share a table with you in the common room while you're studying. Try to get along with roommates Getting along with roommates is a challenge you'd be wise to overcome. You live together, so you will often spend time together without even trying to. It's important to make sure that dorm life doesn't make you unhappy. You should be cautious about facing your roommates over any problems, especially if you have only just met. Remember, be polite but firm. The key is to set expectations and clear boundaries from the beginning. Let your roommates know your life habits, but also observe and respect theirs. Sleeping times and studying schedules, visiting friends and cleaning duties are just some of the topics you should discuss. Avoid drama and gossip As you already know from high school, your social life will be much more pleasant if you avoid causing and getting caught up in drama, no matter whether in class, dorm, or elsewhere. When it comes to gossip, learn to keep your mouth shut and you'll avoid trouble. This is especially important if you live in a dorm, where staying away from someone you've offended is difficult.

This article is particularly written for _ .	"It is natural that young people are often uncomfortable when they are with their parents. They say that their parents don't understand them. They often think that their parents are out of touch with modern ways: that that they are too serious and too strict with their children; and they seldom give their children a free hand. It is true that parents often find it difficult to win their children's trust and they are easy to forget how they themselves felt when young. For example, young people like to act right away without much thinking. It is one of their ways to show that they have grown up and they can face any difficult situation. Older people worry more easily. Most of them plan things ahead, at least in their minds, and do not like their plans to be upset by something unexpected. When you want your parents to let you do something, you will have better success, if you ask before you really start doing it. Young people often make their parents angry with their choices in clothes, in entertainment and in music. But they do not mean to cause any trouble; it is just that they feel cut off from the older people's world, into which they have not yet been accepted. That's why young people want to make a new culture of their own. And if their parents like their music of entertainment or clothes or their ways of speech, this will make young people especially happy. Sometimes you are so proud of yourself that you do not want your parents to say ""yes"" to what you do. All you want is to be left alone and do what you like. It is natural enough, after being a child for so many years, when you were completely under your parents' control. If you plan to control your life, you'd better win your parents over and try to get them to understand you. If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility, they will certainly give you the right to do what you want to do."	['young people']

What's the main idea of this passage?	"Have you ever wanted to achieve something really amazing in life? Well, Greg Mortenson wanted to climb a mountain, but he ended up helping thousands of people to have a better life. Greg's story began with failure. In 1993, he set out to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain. But Greg never made it to the top. After five days, he stumbled into the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan, injured and hungry. The kind villagers there looked after him for several days. Greg saw that the villagers were very poor and hungry, and some of them were ill. Also, the village school didn't have a roof and the children wrote on the ground with sticks, Greg knew he wanted to do something to help. ""I'll build you a school,"" he told the villagers. ""I promise."" Greg went back home to the USA to raise money for the school. He even lived in the car to save money! Finally he went back to Korphe and built the school.

The program is now available to all children worldwide. We continue to welcome teachers, youth groups or agencies who like to work with hurricane survivors. How does it work? Amazing Kids! will match students of the same gender and age with other students who may share similar interests and hobbies, based on the information provided on the registration form.

You will be asked to call the other parent, teacher or group leader of the pen pal Amazing Kids! has selected. If both adults agree that the pen pal match is a good one, then the students may begin writing to each other. If the match is determined not to be a good one, Amazing Kids! will try and find an alternative match.	['$100']
The next day after her first piano lesson, Susie wanted to _ after school.	"Five-year-old Susie loved to listen to her older sister, Emma, play the piano. Susie wanted to play it, too. But every time Susie asked to play, her mother would tell her how much work it needed to learn to play the piano well. Susie was sure she could learn to play it. She decided to make her mother believe that she was ready to learn to play the piano, so Susie helped her mom do the dishes and clean the house. ""Mom, can I start taking the piano lesson?"" asked Susie. ""Susie, if you take the piano lesson, you must practice every day,"" said her mom. Susie was so excited. She could not wait to learn how to play her favorite songs! Susie was excited for her first piano lesson. When she was finally in class, she was surprised: her teacher had flashcards and a book for her. Susie didn't know there were so many other things to know about the piano first. During that first lesson, the teacher didn't let Susie play the piano. The next day, after Susie got home from school, she ran outside. ""Where are you going?"" asked her mom. ""Outside to play volleyball,"" said Susie. ""Bye, Mom!"" ""You must study your piano flashcards,"" said her mom. ""Susie, this is what you wanted, now you have to do it."""	['play volleyball']
What is Paul Stephens mainly concerned about?	"School districts are turning to high-tech solutions-from fingerprint scans to electronic cards - to track kids on school buses and keep them from getting off at the wrong stops. A fingerprint scanning system, approved this month for testing at the Desert Sands district, northeast of San Diego. Students will be scanned as they get on and off the bus. ""Kids get lost. It happens in every school district, every year,"" says John DeVries, president of Global Biometrics Security, which developed the Biometric Observation Security System (BOSS) that's being tested. It happened Oct. 13 when a Prince George's County (Md.) school employee took a 5-year-old student to the wrong bus and the student got off several blocks from home. With BOSS, students' fingerprints are scanned and sent to a database. When they get off, they provide a ""check out"" print. An alarm sounds if the child tries to get off at the wrong place. The fingerprints are not stored, DeVries says. They are converted into a series of numbers that cannot be used to re-create the print, he says. Margaret Gomez of Palm Springs, Calif., whose daughter, then 6, was let off a bus about a mile from her home three years ago, supports the idea. ""Anything is better than what they have in place now."" Other tracking systems include the ZPass from Seattle-based Zonar Systems, which uses a programmed card carried by students or tied to a backpack. It is in about 30 districts, including North Kansas City Schools and Illinois School District 128 in Palos Heights, company executive Chris Oliver says. Paul Stephens, of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego, says tracking students is reasonable, but the data could fall into unauthorized hands. ""What if a child predator was able to get access to this?"" he says."	"[""The safety of children's personal information.""]"
On Boy's Day,you may not see _ .	On Boy's Day,children don't have to go to school.Every family with a boy hangs up huge carpshaped flags.The flags are usually three colors:black(representing the father),red (representing the mother)and blue(representing the son). Japanese parents believe that the flags will bring their boys good luck and give them courage and power. May 5th is Japanese Children's Day. But since the festival is mainly celebrated by boys,it is usually called Boy's Day. The celebration of Boy's Day has a long history.It is said that the festival is derived from the Dragon Boat Festival in China. On this day,Japanese boys eat a special kind of rice cake. It is covered with a leaf and filled with bean paste .Children love to eat it. And eggs on leaves are another traditional food. Japanese children are so happy that they have three festivals each year. In addition to Boy's Day,they also have Girl's Day and the 753 Festival. Girl's Day is the girl's festival on March 3. It is also called the Doll's Festival because on that day,families get a set of dolls at home for their daughters. It is celebrated because the parents want their daughters to be strong and healthy. The 753 Festival is for children aged three, five and seven years old. Japanese people think that these three ages are the luckiest ones in one's life. On that day, these children get special candies wrapped in beautiful bags.The candy is a symbol of a long and healthy life for these children. The 753 Festival falls in November.	['dolls']
"The headline ""Love is a two-way street"" means"	"A father sat at his desk and looked at his bills when his young son rushed in and announced: ""Dad, because today is your birthday and you're 40 years old, I'm going to give you 40 kisses, one for each year!"" When the boy started making good on his word ( ) , the father shouted: ""Andrew, don't do it now. I'm too busy! "" The boy soon fell silent as tears fell from his big blue eyes. Feeling sorry, the father said: ""You can finish later. The boy said nothing but quietly walked away."" That evening the father said: ""Come and finish the kisses now, Andrew!"" But the boy didn't. Unfortunately, a few days later after the father's birthday, the boy had an accident and died. His sad father wrote: ""If only(...,)I could tell him how sorry I am for my thoughtless words, and how much my heart is hurting."" Love is a two-way street.

The writer of the passage thinks that _ .	"Education is not an end, but a means to an end. In other words, we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them. Our purpose is to fit them for life. In some modern countries it has for some time been fashionable to think that by free education for all -- one can solve all the problems of society and build a perfect nation. But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with university degree; they refuse to do what they think ""low"" work; and, in fact, work with hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries. But we have only to think a moment to understand that the work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor; we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns... In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever work suited to his brains and ability and, secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society, and that is very bad to be ashamed of one's work. Only such a type of education can be considered valuable to society."	"[""all the social problems can't be solved by education""]"

In which country is whale hunting permitted at the moment?	"Environmental activists in South Korea are condemning a government plan to hunt endangered whales for scientific research. They believe the plan is part of an effort to restart commercial whaling activities. Such activities are banned in many countries. South Korea announced the proposal in July at a meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Panama. The head of the South Korean delegation said the plan was needed to answer questions about minke whale populations. He said the hunt would take place near the South Korean coast. But he did not say how many of the animals would be caught. The International Whaling Commission has yet to make a decision on the South Korean plan. The organization banned commercial whaling in 1986 because of concerns about the survival of whale species. But now, some South Korean fishermen say they are facing a threat from minke whales. They say these animals are eating what would have been their catch. The plan was immediately condemned by anti-whaling nations. Wildlife activists also criticized the proposal. Han Jeong-hee works in Seoul for the environmental group Greenpeace.""It's really regretful to hear that the South Korean government is, like, considering conducting scientific whaling. Scientific whaling is just, like, thinly disguised commercial whaling. And, you know, we are of course against all commercial whaling. Japan's the only country that is doing scientific whaling at the moment and South Korea is just trying to follow that."" Apart from the plan in South Korea, an aquarium in the American state of Georgia also wants to import eighteen beluga whales from Russia. The United States currently has 31 beluga whales. They are living in six aquariums and marine parks. Four of them are at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. The Georgia Aquarium has asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for permission to import the beluga whales. If it was approved, aquarium officials would send some of the animals to the other facilities. The Georgia Aquarium says it hopes to use the beluga whales in research, education and breeding programs. They currently are being held at a Russian research center. Yet many people oppose the plan. They say it is wrong to catch any wild animal. NOAA officials are studying how the beluga whales might be affected by being brought to the United States. They also want to know whether the Georgia Aquarium and its partners can properly care for the whales and how they might be used in educational activities. The federal Marine Mammal Protection Act sets rules which NOAA must consider when deciding whether these animals may be imported. NOAA officials told VOA they plan to make a decision on the request by early next year."	['Japan.']

What can be inferred from the passage?	"Recently a research was carried out in London,Birmingham and Leeds among teachers from different schools about student behavior management. The majority of teachers said that behavior management is the biggest challenge they face in teaching.They are against the idea of a ""one size fits all"" approach to behavior management and believe that how they deal with behavior depends on their analysis of what is driving the behavior.Many teachers make the analysis in three steps.First,observe what the student is doing;then look into what drives the behavior and finally identify what is the real problem to deal with,e.g.attention seeking or being unable to follow the lessons etc..However,many teachers felt it sometimes difficult as schools did not always effectively communicate the necessary information about the students for them to do it. The behaviors are generally divided into low,mid and high level.Teachers felt low and high level behavior was easy to analyze and deal with because low level behavior was seen as the least serious of a problem;and there is clear structure in place for dealing with high level behavior. However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers. Teachers also felt that the laws to protect pupils have resulted in a sense of teachers having fewer rights to manage behavior.In case they deal with or be seen to deal with behavior wrongly or improperly,the results could be very serious:damage the child or teacher,especially their career."	['A teacher risks losing the job if he/she manages student behavior improperly.']
What's the best title for the passage?	"If you have a chance to go to Taiwan, there's one place you should not miss-- the Taipei Palace Museum. The museum has around 650,000 pieces of ancient Chinese treasures. These treasures were originally in the Palace Museum in Beijing. But how did they get to Taiwan? In 1931, the Japanese invaded the northeast part of China. To protect the national treasures from the Japanese, the government of the Republic of China decided to move some important pieces to Nanjing. However, they did not stay long in Nanjing. In 1949, the people's Liberation Army won in the Liberation War. The Guomindang government went from Nanjing to Taiwan. Along with them they took the art pieces. The Taipei Palace Museum was set up in 1965 to hold the national treasures. Taiwan people are very proud of the Taipei Palace Museum. Some of the collections are world famous. One of the most visited art pieces in the museum is the ""Jade Cabbage"". It is made from a single piece of jade . If you take a close look, you can see two grasshoppers on the leaves, a large one and a small one, which were the symbol of many children in a family. If you are interested in the treasures, you could take a look at a TV programme called Taipei Palace Museum. It gives a picture of the treasures of the Taipei Palace Museum. There are also interviews with over a hundred experts about the stories behind some of the pieces."	['The Taipei Palace Museum']
How is the text organized?	"Haagen-Dazs from Europe started in 1989 and is 5-10 times more expensive than regular ice cream. There is no real advantage. However, it adopted a unique marketing strategy, and quickly occupied the market as a top ice cream brand. Haagen-Dazs did not set up shops in ordinary supermarkets or grocery stores. Haggen-Dazs leisure fashion shops are located in busy sections of malls. The layout is carefully planned to create an elegant atmosphere, and sometimes, a flagship store will cost several million dollars. Compared to other ice cream brands, Haagen-Dazs consumers are tightly grouped. It is understood that Haagen-Dazs seldom does television advertising. The majority of advertisements are high impact visually in print advertisements. In particular many advertisements target the wealthy consumers. Moreover, if the consumer spends 500 Yuan they can become a member. These members will be regularly sent advertisements by direct mail. Praise of customers is a powerful weapon. There is always much creative ingenuity in Haagen-Dazs advertising, so it is remembered by the people: initial advertisements such as: ""Delicious Haagen-Dazs, like 24K gold, Kobe beef from Japan, original palm oil, mushroom truffles and Chinese ceramics...what 'ice cream'was waiting for."" ""love her, let her eat Haagen-Dazs"" This classic advertisement attracted numerous Haagen-Dazs lovers who became regulars. Today, Haggen-Dazs has about 700 stores in 55 countries with annual sales of more than 1 billion US dollars. Haagen-Dazs has become the world's most popular ice cream brand. In the United States, its market share is 6.1%, 1%in France, 4.6% in Japan, 4% in Singapore, and 5% in Hong Kong. Determined to win the majority of wealthy customers they combined positioning in the marketplace with dedicated brand goals. This is the real secret of success."

Which of the following best states Donal Trollop's idea?	While all my classmates seen to be crazy about a one-way ticket to Mars , I'd rather say Mars is totally unsuitable for human existence. People won't have enough food supplies there, and the terrible environment would make it impossible for them to live a long life. Besides, the journey won't be safe. Can anybody explain to me just why people would go to Mars, never to return? Steve Minear, UK Here are the things you can think of: the desire to explore a foreign and unique environment, the excitement of being the first humans to open up a new world, the expectation of fame and glory...For scientists there is another reason. Their observations and research will probably lead to great scientific achievements. Donal Trollop, Canada There are already too many people on the Earth. I think that sometime before the end of the century, there will be a human colony on Mars. It will happen when people finally realize that tow-way trips to the red planet Mars are unnecessary. Most of the danger of space Flight is in the launches and landings. Cutting the trip home would therefore reduce the danger of accidents, save a lot of money, and open the way to building an everlasting human settlement on another world. Enough supplies can be sent on ahead. And every two years more supplies and more people will needs, and Mars is far more pleasant than the other planets in the outer space. Paul Davies.

Mauson was put into prison, because _ .	"Cyril was a small town. The houses there were all made of wood; almost everything in the houses such as cupboards, tables and chairs were made of wood, too. And all the houses faced south. The town was never peaceful. Fire broke out once a week on summer afternoons. Residents were puzzled who the real firebug was. One day a big fire broke out. It was said that a Negro had jumped out of the house on fire, so the police arrested all the Negroes in the street. However, fire never stopped to breaking out when the Negroes were in prison. Mauson, a physics teacher didn't believe that the Negroes were the firebugs, for he really knew about those Negroes, He made up his mind to find out who the real firebug was. One day he was invited to drink in a pub and happened to notice that many bottles and plastic plates were baked by the hot sunrays. Suddenly he realized what the actual fact was. He jumped with joy, saying, ""I've got the answer!"" Mauson dashed out of the pub to his friend's house nearby, which also faced south. He made an experiment there to confirm his idea. The next Saturday afternoon, Mauson asked some policemen and newsmen to come to the house. They were told that the real firebug would be shown there. At that time the sun was shining full into the house and it became hotter and hotter inside the room. Someone wanted to draw the curtains together, while another was going to use a bottle to drink water, but neither got permission from Mauson, who wanted to let the firebug in. ""Now,"" said Mauson, ""this house will soon catch fire."" People looked at each other in surprise. Mauson asked them to look at the bottles and focus on the table cloth. After a while the cloth gave off a burning smell and began to catch fire! The mystery of fire was discovered, but the police wouldn't believe him and insisted that Negroes had been the firebugs. Instead they arrested Mauson and put him into prison. But Mauson said he would never turn against science."	['he had fund out the real firebug']
Which of the following is True according to the passage?	"How we look and how we appear to others probably worries us more when we are in our teens or early twenties than at any other time in our life. Few of us are content to accept ourselves as we are, and few are brave enough to ignore the trends of fashion. Most fashion magazines or TV advertisements try to persuade us that we should dress in a certain way or behave in a certain manner. If we do, they tell us, we will be able to meet new people with confidence and deal with every situation confidently and without embarrassment. Changing fashion, of course, does not apply just to dress. A barber today does not cut a boy's hair in the same way as he used to, and girls do not make up in the same way as their mothers and grandmothers did. The advertisers show us the latest fashionable styles and we are constantly under pressure to follow the fashion in case our friends think we are odd or dull. What causes fashions to change? Sometimes convenience or practical necessity or just the fancy of an influential person can establish a fashion. Take hats for example. In cold climates, early buildings were cold inside, so people wore hats indoors as well as outside. In recent times, the late President Kennedy caused a depression in the American hat industry by not wearing hats, and more American men followed his example. There is also a cyclical pattern in fashion. In the 1920s in Europe and America, short skirts became fashionable. After World War II, they dropped to ankle length. Then they got shorter and shorter until the miniskirt was in fashion. After a few more years, skirts became longer again. Today, society is much freer and easier than it used to be. It is no longer necessary to dress like everyone else. Within reason, you can dress as you like or do your hair the way you like instead of the way you should because it is the fashion. The popularity of jeans and the ""untidy"" look seems to be a reaction against the increasingly expensive fashion of the top fashion houses. At the same time, appearance is still important in certain circumstances and then we must choose our clothes carefully. It would be foolish to go to an interview for a job in a law firm wearing jeans and a sweater, and it would be discourteous to visit some distinguished scholar looking as if we were going to the beach or a night club. However, you need never feel depressed if you don't look like the latest fashion photo. Look around you and you'll see that no one else does either!"	['President Kennedy once caused a disaster in the American hat industry']
According to Mr Johnson, _ .	"Teenagers will be told to ""stand up for their elders"" on public transport -- or risk losing their right to free travel. London Mayor Boris Johnson will declare plans today to make youngsters sign a ""courtesy pledge"" to promise to behave in a respectful manner when travelling in the capital. The three-point pledge states that they will give up their seats to the elderly, pregnant and disabled; keep from using offensive or threatening language; and be courteous and polite to fellow passengers and staff. Those who refuse, or are caught behaving in a _ manner, will have their free travel passes removed. The plan -- a key part of Mr. Johnson's re-election bid-- will initially affect the 400,000 ll-to-15-year-olds in London who qualify for free travel cards, but Tory sources believe the idea could be used across the country. A Conservative insider said: ""The plan corresponds perfectly with the push to create a Big Society. It is about changing culture and expectations around behavior to improve the atmosphere on buses and trains for everyone."" Speaking before today's launch, Mr. Johnson said he was determined to deal with the anti-social behavior of a ""minority of youngsters"" on public transport. ""When I was a boy, I was taught to stand up for those less able to, ""he said. ""Youngsters enjoy the privilege of free travel, which is paid for by Londoners, but they have to understand that with that privilege comes responsibility. Anyone who abuses this privilege will have it taken away, and will have to earn that right bach ."" Teenagers found guilty of a serious violation of the new behavior rules will lose their travel passes, and will have to carry out unpaid community work to earn them back. Mr. Johnson is also introducing a ""two strikes and you're out"" policy to deal with repeat offenders, under which those committing a second serious violation of the rules will lose their travel rights permanently."

Dinosaur scientists can get information directly by _ .	"Unlike modern animal scientists, dinosaur scientists cannot sit on a hillside and use telescopes to watch dinosaurs in order to know how they lived and whether they were good parents. Instead, they have to search hard for information from dinosaurs' fossils because dinosaurs died out millions of years ago. It's very difficult for the scientists to reach an agreement because different results can be got from the same fossils. Many fossils of the same kind of dinosaurs have been dug out from one place. They might have formed when an entire group of dinosaurs got stuck all at once, or they might have been the result of dinosaurs getting stuck one after another over a course of a few centuries. Thus we can say that dinosaurs might have in the first case lived in big groups and in the second lived alone. Though there are two different results, dinosaur scientists now generally agree that at least some kinds of dinosaurs lived in big groups. ""That's pretty much settled at this point,"" says Paul Sereno. A kind of dinosaurs called Sauropods left behind tracks in the western United States that appear to run north and south, suggesting that they even moved long distances together. As to whether dinosaurs cared for their young, dinosaur scientists have turned to the closest living relatives of dinosaurs-birds and crocodiles-for possible models. Birds give a lot of care to their young, while crocodiles just help their young to the water. The discovered fossils of dinosaurs sitting on their eggs and staying with their young suggest the parents were taking care of their babies, but we still cannot say that all dinosaurs did the same. There is still a long way to go before the above questions could be answered. Dinosaur scientists, will have to find more proof to reach an agreement."	['studying dinosaur fossils']
The main cause of pollution is .	People all over the world today are beginning to hear and learn more and more about the problem of pollution.Pollution is caused either by man's release of completely new artificial substances into the environment,or by releasing greatly increased amounts of a natural substance,such as oil from oil tankers into the sea. The whole industrial process which makes many of the goods and machines we need and use in our daily lives,is bound to create a number of waste products which upset the environmental balance,or the ecological balance as is also known.Many of these waste products can be prevented or disposed of.But while more and more new and complex goods are produced,there will be new,dangerous waste to be disposed of,for example,the waste products from nuclear power stations.Many people,therefore,see pollution as only part of a larger and more complex problem,that is,the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods.Others again see the problem mainly in connection with agriculture,where new methods are helping farmers grow more and more on their land to feed our ever-increasing population.However,the land itself is gradually becoming worn out as it is being used,in some cases,too heavily,and artificial fertilizers can not restore the balance. Whatever its underlying reasons are,there is no doubt that much of the pollution caused could be controlled if only companies,individuals and governments would make more efforts.In the home there is an obvious need to control litter and waste.Food comes wrapped up three or four times in packages that all have to be disposed of;drinks are increasingly sold in bottles or tins which can not be reused.This not only causes a litter problem,but also is a great waste of resources,in terms of glass,metals and paper.Advertising has helped this process by persuading many of us not only to buy things we neither want nor need,but also to throw away much of what we do buy.Pollution and waste combine to be a problem everyone can help to solve by cutting out unnecessary buying,excessive consumption and careless disposal of the products we use in our daily lives.

The most popular episode had nearly 38 million _ . But why is the show so popular? The idea of the show is this: everyday people get a chance to show their singing talents to the world and become an ""American Idol"", a famous pop star. Anyone in the country(between the ages of 15 and 28) can have a try--a chance of becoming world famous. In fact, everyday people are the ones who are allowed on the show. If you are a professional singer--you cannot be an American Idol. The winners are regular people from small towns--people who sang in churches or bars but had bigger dreams. The winners of the contest don't get a prize of money. Instead, they get to record an album. Famous stars such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood gained fame from winning the show. So, it seems the contest really works. It is the idea that anyone can be a super star that draws people to this program.

The writer discusses the marriage of young adults in order to show which of the following?	"Upon reaching an appropriate age (usually between 18 and 21 years), children are encouraged, but not forced, to ""leave the nest"" and begin an independent life. After children leave home, they often find social relationship and financial support outside the family. Parents do not arrange marriages for their children, nor do children usually ask permission of their parents to get married. Romantic love is most often the basis for marriage in the United States; young adults meet their future spouses through other friends, at jobs, and in organizations and religious institutions. Although children choose their own spouses, they still hope their parents will approve of their choices. In many families, parents feel that children should make major life decisions by themselves. A parent may try to influence a child to follow a particular profession but the child is free to choose another career. Sometimes children do exactly the opposite of what their parents wish in order to be independent. A son may decide not to go into his father's business on purpose because of a fear that he will lose his autonomy in his father's workplace. This independence from parents is not an indication that parents and children do not love each other. Strong love between parents and children is universal and this is no exception in the American family. Coexisting with such love in the American family are cultural values of self-reliance and independence."	['They have independence.']
People decided to honor Edison when _ .	Thomas Alva Edison was awarded more patents on inventions than any other American. When he died in 1931, Americans wondered how they could best show their respect for him. One suggestion was that the nation observe a minute or two of total blackout(,). All electric power would be shut off in homes, streets, and factories. Perhaps his suggested plan made Americans realize fully what Edison and his inventions mean to them. Electric power was too important to the country. Shutting it off for even a short time would have led to complete confusion . A blackout was out of the question. On the day of Edison's funeral ,many people silently dimmed their lights. In this way they honoured the man who had done more than anyone else to the great force of electrity	['he died in 1931']

What can we learn from the studies?	"Dieters' who eat meals high in protein might lose a bit more weight than those who get less protein and more carbohydrates all other things being equal, a new analysis of past studies suggests. Researchers found that over an average of 12 weeks, people having a highprotein diet lost about 1.8 extra pounds, and more body fat, than those having a standard-protein diet. Wycherley from the University of South"" Australia in Adelaide, the lead author on the study says it's possible that the body may spend more energy and bum more calories while dealing with protein, compared to carbohydrates. Another explanation for the link his team observed is that eating protein helps preserve muscle mass and muscle mass bums more calories, even when the body is resting, than other types of mass. He says people in the studies tend to get protein from a variety of animal and vegetable sources. Vegetable sources of protein include beans. It is not obvious why a higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratio might help people lose more pounds----and one obesity researcher not involved in the new analysis questioned whether the trials were strong enough to make that conclusion. ""The studies are generally far too short to tell effect,"" Dr. James Levine from the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, told Reuters Health in an e-mail. But given the limitations of the present evidence, Levine said, ""It makes no real difference which of the weight-loss ways one chooses."""	['Protein helps keep muscle mass which bums calories.']
Mr and Mrs Smith had a quarrel. Their friend, Mr Brown, wanted to talk to them. When he came back, he told his wife that he had been trying to help the Smiths by _ .	"Sayings are quite common in spoken English. We don't normally put them in a composition or a letter. Sometimes it is helpful if you know what common proverbs mean. Here are a few examples. "" Once bitten, twice shy."" If a dog bites me, I shall be twice as careful in future when I see it. This proverb is also used to apply to many things and not only to dogs. For example, if you have been cheated at a shop, you will not go to the same shop again. ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" If I am a hunter, trying to catch birds, it is better to catch one than to see two birds in a bush but not able to catch them. Thus this means that what you have already got is better than the chance of being able to get something bigger in future. "" Don't be a dog in a manger "" means "" Don't be selfish."" In a stable ,the manger is the place where the horse's food is put. Sometimes a dog will sleep in the manger and bark when a horse comes to get its food. The dog doesn't want to eat the horse's food in the manger but it will not let the horse eat it. "" He who pays the piper calls the tune ."" A piper is a musician. The man who pays a musician can say what tunes the man will play. Thus this means that if a man provides the money for a plan, he can say how it will be carried out. ""To pour oil on troubled waters"" is to try to calm things down. Oil is lighter than water. If a ship is in trouble at sea, another ship may come to help it. The second ship can send small boats to rescue people. However, it may first pour oil on the sea to make the sea less rough."	['pouring oil on the troubled waters']
The passage is probably a _ .	"Scientists have created a "" human-like robot"" that can dance and do the housework. "" Mahru"" has been developed to imitate humans and can move its lips, eyebrows and pupils . The machine can also move its upper and lower body freely and automatically stop itself when walking. In addition, it has been programmed to give out two kinds of pleasant smells to match its emotions. The 1.5 tall robot was produced by researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) and is the first South Korean- developed machine of its kind. ""'Mahru' will open the way for the commercial use of humanoid robots doing housework,"" You Bum-Jae, leader of the development research team ,said. ""'Mahru' can dance while walking on its legs and is able to work in place of a human."" Through an advanced motion capture system, ""Mahru"" can follow a variety of human movements and move its hands freely enough to deal with any obstacles that may get in its way when walking. State-funded KIST showed the robot during a presentation at its head office in Seoul. People here were treated to an entertaining demonstration which saw the robot show off the full range of its skills, most notably s series of dance moves. The research team added that they had designed another "" Mahru"", this time with sensors allowing it to distinguish between faces and objects. The showing of "" Mahru"" came a week after researcher in Japan said they had created the ""most human-like"" robot in the world.

According to the passage, what do the residents in the four cities have in common?	"The Happiest Cities On Earth If you're looking for a cheery destination for your next vacation, consider these four spots and get ready to take notes on how to really live the good life. Singapore With one of the highest population densities in the world and residents known for being workaholics, it's hard to imagine the city-state of Singapore having one of the happiest populations on earth. And yet in a recent survey, 95% of them said they were either very happy or quite happy. They give their city high marks for cleanliness and safety--subways are pristine and unfailingly arrive on time, and police are seen as helpful and good at their jobs. What's more, they feel they can count on their neighbours--all 5.1 million of them. Arhus, Denmark The residents of Arhus cheerfully part with 68% of their income in taxes, knowing that in return they will be guaranteed free healthcare, free daycare, and a top-notch education for their children. An energetic city of 300,000 with a lively cultural scene and a diverse number of religions represented, _ (the range in incomes is narrow), as well as easy access to the nearby sea and surrounding countryside, make Arhus seem more like a small town. San Luis Obispo, CA According to a 2008 Gallup-Healthways study, people who live in San Luis Obispo are more likely than residents of other U.S. cities to smile and experience joy and are less likely to experience pain or depression. About 64,000 of the 260,000 people in the greater metropolitan area , located halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, volunteer at over 11,000 non-profit organizations. Few journeys to work are longer than 10 minutes (one reason its members rank in the upper third for job satisfaction), so ""it's easy to be involved,"" resident Pierre Rademaker said. Business signs are unobtrusive by law, fewer than 11% of residents smoke--the lower rate in the U.S.--there are lots of bike lanes, and the city's plaza draws crowds of people for free concerts on summer Fridays. What's not to love? Monterrey, Mexico The people of Monterrey don't enjoy high household incomes or access to good healthcare. Instead, there's a profound sense of gratitude for the new political freedom enjoyed since the oppressive Institutional Revolutionary Party lost power in 2000--the first time in nearly a century--as well as an emphasis on social life over work. Another reason Monterrey residents may be so happy is their faith in God and family, and their ability to tough it out through bad times. ""We laugh at sickness, poverty and even death,"" says Basanez, a political scientist who lives in Monterrey. ""We even have a holiday to celebrate death. November 2, the Day of the Dead, is one of the biggest holidays of the year."""	['The majority of the residents are satisfied with their current life.']
We can infer that Mayor Willie Brown_.	"SAN FRANCISCO--The ""Reading Wizard"", an 11 - year - old - boy, whose offer to read to children without being paid at a local library was refused by libraries, will get to read to younger kids after all. Mayor Willie Brown last Wednesday ordered San Francisco Public Library officials to allow John O'Connor to read to preschool children to get them interested in books and stop them from watching television and video games. ""I didn't expect this kind of attention. "" John said, ""It's just shocking."" John has chosen his first book, ""The King's Giraffe"", and made up fliers inviting neighborhood children, aged from three to six, to the Presidio Branch every Wednesday afternoon.

But his idea was refused - on the phone, in person and finally with a letter from Toni Bernardi, the chief of the library's children and youth services. Using terms like ""age appropriate material"" ,she wrote that only library workers are allowed to read to children. John then went to a member of the city board of supervisors , who advised him to write letters to the library officials. ""Our libraries are supposed to turn kids on, not to turn them off.""

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Mary Cassatt is one of the first great women American painters. At first her father did not want her to become an artist. But she followed her dreams and became an artist.She was born on May 22, 1844, and lived in Europe for several years as a child. Her family returned to the United States and, at age 16, Mary attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Four years later she decided she couldn't learn anything fresh and practical in Philadelphia, so she returned to Europe. There she studied the skills of the masters in Rome, Seville, Antwerp, and Paris. Mary received the chance of a lifetime at the age of 33 when the famous French painter, Edgar Degas, asked her to join a group of painters that included now-famous artists like Manet and Renoir. Their style of painting is called Impressionism. They used primary colors and short brush strokes in their work. They recognized Mary 's spirit and powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows. Mary painted what she saw: gardens, and paintings of persons , especially of mothers and children involved in everyday living. One of her paintings, ""Young Mother and Two Children,"" was given to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today. Mary never married and, in 1877, her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her. Mary devoted much of her time to them for the next 18 years to their care. Mary painted until 1914 when her failing eyesight made it impossible to continue. She spent the later years of her life in Paris. She died in 1926 at the age of 82. Unfortunately,all her life, she refused to accept students."	['during the last ten year of life, she painted nothing.']
Which of the following is mentioned to show that an earthquake can kill too many people?	An earthquake happens when two plates rub together. The earth plates travel in different directions and at different speeds. If one plate is slowly forced underneath the other, pressure builds up until the plates break apart. This process causes the ground to move. It is an earthquake. In other words, earthquakes are the shaking of the earth's surface caused by the earth's rocky outer layer as a result of the energy stored within the earth. The strain within the rocks is suddenly released . The damage an earthquake causes depends on where it is and the time it is happening. If an unpopulated region is struck, there will be low loss of life or property. If it hits a large city, there may be many injuries and much destruction. Many of the areas at risk are largely populated now. Major earthquakes hitting those areas today could produce terrible damage. Actually, there are several million small earth-quakes every year. Large earthquakes such as the 1964 Alaska quake that measured 9.2 on the Richter scale, cause millions of dollars in damage. In the last 500 years, millions of people have been killed by earthquakes around the world -- including 240,000 in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake in China. A 60-second or less earthquake can cause devastation that continues for years after the first tremor . In 1972, a series of severe earthquakes struck Managua, Nicaragua. Fifteen years later, the city still looked the way it had a week after the earthquake hit, because the country did not have the necessary money to rebuild it. The shaking of the earth is sometimes not the greatest disaster. It is in the _ fires and floods that often the greatest damage occurs. In the 1906 earthquake, it was the fires caused after it that did the majority of the damage. An earthquake can also destroy dams high above a city or valleys, causing floods to sweep down and sweep away everything in their path.	['The 1976 Tangshan earthquake.']
The main purpose of the text is to _ .	It was September 5, 2009. Lexi Youngberg, then 16, was on vacation in Spring Lake, Michigan. She was riding on a small boat with her friends, Robby and Kaitlin, when a motorboat crashed into them. The sound was so loud that other boaters heard it over the roar of their engines. The teen boy who had been driving the motorboat stepped on the gas by mistake. Kaitlin, 23, had only small cuts, but Robby, 15, had been badly cut by the propeller . And Lexi was floating facedown in the water. When one boater swam to Lexi, she was breathing. However, she was unconscious. She had a deep cut on her head. And the lower part of her left leg, just below the knee, was gone. A doctor rode up in another boat and tried to save Robby, but it was too late. For Lexi, the good news is that she survived while the bad news is that she lost one of her legs forever. When Lexi looked at her swollen leg, she felt hopeless. But as time passed, Lexi began to feel stronger. She was grateful that her life had been spared, and she decided to make the most of it. At the end of November 2009, Lexi met with Dr. John Hardy, who was an expert at making artificial legs. She hoped he would help her get back to doing the things she loved.

The life then was very _ . People couldn't find jobs easily.	A long time before I was born, my grandma and grandpa moved into the house on Beechwood Avenue. They had a young family of 4 little girls. During that time, work was hard to find, so Grandpa did whatever jobs he could. He worked on a farm during the week and at weekends he and Grandpa grew some of their own food in the garden . Everybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food from the garden and enjoyed the beautiful flowers. Grandma made jam with strawberry, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches. It was good to eat through the long winter. The family grew up, and before too many years had passed, the grandchildren came to visit. Grandma and Grandpa still planted their garden every spring. Everyone still enjoyed the good food from the garden and always took some home. Grandchildren grew up, and grandparents grew older. It became harder for Grandma and Grandpa to keep up the garden. So they made it a little smaller. There was still plenty to eat from the garden and lovely flowers to enjoy. Then one summer when Grandpa was eighty-nine years old, all he could do was to watch from his chair as the vegetables grew and the flowers came out. Summer slowly went away, and Grandpa died before it was time to bring in the harvest .	['hard']
Why did Mandara act strangely one day?	"Mandara seemed to know something big was about to happen. So she let out a yell, caught hold of her 2-year-old daughter Kibibi and climbed up into a tree. She lives at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. And on Tuesday, August 23rd, witnesses say she seemed to sense the big earthquake that shook much of the East Coast before any humans knew what was going on. And she's not the only one. In the moments before the quake, an orangutan let out a loud call and then climbed to the top of her shelter. ""It's very different from their normal call,"" said Brandie Smith, the zookeeper. ""The lemurs (monkey-like animals of Madagascar) will sound an alarm call if they see or hear something highly unusual."" But you can't see or hear an earthquake 15 minutes before it happens, can you? Maybe you can -- if you're an animal. ""Animals can hear above and below our range of hearing,"" said Brandie Smith. ""That's part of their special abilities. They're more sensitive to the environment, which is how they survive."" Primates weren't the only animals that seemed to sense the quake before it happened. One of the elephants made a warning sound. And a huge lizard ran quickly for _ . The flamingoes (a kind of bird) gathered before the quake and stayed together until the shaking stopped. So what kind of vibrations were the animals picking up in the moments before the quake? Scientist Susan Hough says earthquakes produce two types of waves -- a weak ""P"" wave and then a much stronger ""S"" wave. The ""P"" stands for ""primary"". And the ""S"" stands for ""secondary"". She said she thinks the ""P"" wave might be what set the animals off. Not all the animals behaved unusually before the quake. For example, Smith says the zoo's giant pandas didn't jump up until the shaking actually began. But many of the other animals seemed to know something was coming before it happened. ""I'm not surprised at all,"" Smith said."	['Because it sensed something unusual would happen.']
If you have a cold, you can do the following except _ .	As we know, it is common for people to catch a cold in winter and most people believe they know the reason for colds. However, scientists say people have some wrong beliefs about the cause of colds. Many people think that once you get infected by colds, you will not be easy to be attacked by colds for the rest of your life. That's not the case. There are about 200 different viruses that cause the common cold. You catch a cold because of one kind of them this time, but you might catch a cold next time because of another. Others believe that people get sick just because of the cold weather in winter. That is also wrong. It's because people tend to stay closer in winter and the cold virus is _ from one person to another through handshakes, sneezing, or coughing. While there is no actual cure for the common cold, scientists say there are still a few things you can do to help you. Some experts say honey and chicken soup are effective against colds. Especially honey. There is increasing evidence that it helps shorten the duration of the common cold sometimes even by two to three days particularly in children. Chicken soup also helps reduce the duration of the cold. In addition, if you do have a cold and you don't feel like eating anything, it's not going to hurt you but you have to drink a lot and you can drink water or tea because doctors say the water cycle in your bodies helps to cure colds. That's very important. Though there is more than one way to deal with colds, doctors say the best advice is to continue using whatever works best for you.	['forcing yourself to eat']
Liam Bates was most likely to get the job mainly due to his _ .	"When Marco Polo travelled to Hangzhou, China 700 hundred years ago, never had he thought he'd be creating a job of social media ambassador in the 21st century in China. On May 20, one lucky foreigner would be selected to become the modern-day Marco Polo, getting a free 15-day trip to the scenic city of Hangzhou in China, and rewarded $55,000 in the next year for working part-time to promote the city to the global audience. Five finalists from Australia, Romania, U.S., Switzerland and France were in the final race. They came from a pool of 700 applicants from around the world, carefully selected by the Hangzhou Tourism Commission on their familiarity with China, social media presence and adventurous spirit. Located about 100 miles southwest to Shanghai, Hangzhou is home to 844 million population and among China's richest cities as measures by per-capita GDP. Traditionally, Hangzhou is known for its charming West Lake, a UNESCO world heritage site with traditional Chinese stories and tales, and the Grand Canal, which travels from Hangzhou to Beijing and was a key route of transportation in ancient China. The city's mild climate and charming environment drew 97 million tourists last year, contributing to 6.5% of the city's GDP. The lucky winner would start an all-expense-paid trip to Hangzhou, which, in addition to visits to tourist sites and tastings of delicious food, also would include a four-day ride along the Grand Canal and three evenings spent at a local resident's home.

Tom was _ .	One day Tom was playing with his younger brother Paul beside the well near their home. Suddenly Tom fell down the well. Paul was frightened. Their parents were not at home. Their father was working in the factory and their mother was helping a neighbor. Tom called his younger brother, Paul. Paul looked at the bottom of the well and saw his brother standing in the water of the well. Tom was five feet tall and the water was only three feet deep. Paul was glad to see his brother safe in the well. Then he ran home and brought a long rope. He was only six and not very strong, so he could not pull Tom out. He was thinking hard and finally had a good idea. He tied one end of the rope to a tree and threw the other end to his brother in the well. Then Tom climbed up the rope and got out of the well. He thanked his brother first and went home to exchange his wet clothes.	['playing with Paul']

What can be the best title for the text?	"Since 1984, Philadelphia has been cleaning up its act. One by one, graffiti-covered walls are being changed into outdoor art. So far, more than 1,800 murals have been painted. Philadelphia now has more murals than any other American city. The walls that were once ugly with graffiti are now covered with beautiful pictures of historical heroes and modern art, thanks to the Mural Arts Program (MAP). Its work makes schools and public places attractive, and its citizens very proud. The program began as part of Philadelphia's Anti-Graffiti Network. Jane Golden is the MAP's artistic director. ""When people ask me what our program is about,"" she says, ""I answer them with one word: hope."" Each year, the MAP offers youth art programs and workshops. Some one-time graffiti writers even help paint MAP murals. The MAP's work, says Golden, is all about developing a sense of community . When a neighborhood requests a mural, the MAP works with the people there to develop a message. Some messages have been ""Safe Streets,"" ""Love and Care,"" and ""Peace Walk."" The MAP receives up to 50 requests for murals each week. Last year, the workers painted 140 murals. ""The making of a mural enters people's collective memory as an extraordinary, pleasant moment in neighborhood history"" says Golden, who began as a muralist in Los Angeles."

Their research included chemistry, medicine, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science-almost every area of science. Forty students were invited to Washington, D.C. for the final judging. A group of scientists judged them on their research abilities, critical thinking skills and creativity. The judges also questioned the students about scientific problems before deciding on the winners. The top winner received 100,000 dollars for college. Shannon Babb of American Fork High School studied the water quality of tile Spanish Fork River in Utah for six years. She found that people have a harmful effect on the river through human activity, including agriculture. And she suggested ways to improve the water quality in the future. These include educating the public not to put household chemicals down the drains , which lead to the river eventually. Seventeen-year-old Yi Sun of the Hanker School in San Jose, California, earned the second place. He won a 75,000-dollar scholarship for new discoveries about a mathematical theory known as random walks. His work could help computer scientists and chemists. Yi Sun was born in China.

According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	"Many boys love reading about the legends of old pirates and dreaming of their own wild adventures. But modern pirates are not a thing of the past. Last month Somali pirates did their boldest hijacking to date. They seized the Saudi supertanker Sirius Star carrying crude oil worth about $100 million. They demanded $15 million to free the ship and its crew. The pirates have kept hitting the headlines this year: 92 attacks have been attempted, with 36 successful hijackings and 268 crew members taken hostage . The Chinese fishing ship Tianyu 8, with 17 Chinese and 8 foreigners on board, has been in their hands since November 14. Of course piracy is nothing new. Even since there has been water and ships there have been pirates. The earliest documented history of pirates dates back to the 13thcentury in the Mediterranean Sea. Even the famous Roman emperor Julius Caesar was once kidnapped by pirates. Piracy reached its peak in the mid-1700s. It was during this time in the Caribbean and off the coast of Africa that men like ""Blackbeard the Pirate"" made this profession attractive. But with the creation of stronger national Navies piracy became less popular around the world. In the mid-20thcentury, most pirates were petty thieves. They used hooks to sneak on board ships at anchor, and grabbed all that they could find. _ However, nowadays piracy has become a multi-million-dollar business at tracting many in poor countries. Pirates are treated like heroes among local fishermen. They use satellite phones and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Once they spot their target, they swarm the ship with fast boats and shoot it by firing AK-47s or even rocket-propelled grenades . Then they hold the ship and its crews for money. ""The world should take forceful actions together to fight piracy,"" said leaders at the Asian and Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. ""However, putting in anti-piracy army can only be half of the solution. We have to protect the fair chance of Somali fishermen to get a good living and keep them from the lure of easy money,"" said Peter Lehr, a lecturer in terrorism studies."

"How does Beth Truman think of the ""wugging""?"	"Wugging, or web use giving, describes the act of giving to charity at no cost to the user. By using Everyclick. com, which is being added to a number of university computers across theprefix = st1 /UKthis week , students can raise money every time they search, but it won't cost them a penny. Research shows that students are enthusiastic about supporting charity, 88% of full time students have used the Internet to give to charity. This figure is high, considering this age group is often the least likely to have their own income. 19% of 22 to 24 years old have short-term debts of more thanPS5,000. With rising personal debt levels in this age group, due to university tuition fees or personal loans and a lack of long-term savings, traditional methods of donating to charity are often not appealing or possible. Beth Truman, a 21-year-old recent university graduate has used Everyclick. com to donate to her chosen charity, the RSPCA, for two years and has seen the ""wugging"" movement grow popular with students. ""When you're at university you become more socially aware, but it's sometimes hard to give to others when you have little money yourself. "" says Beth. ""Wugging is great for people in this age group as it allows them to use the technology on a daily basis to give it to charity, without costing them a single penny. "" Wugging is perfect for people who want to be more socially aware and supportive but don't feel they have the _ to do so. Students using the web can generate money for causes they care about without it costing them anything in terms of time or money, and charities get a valuable source of funding.

According to the passage, the father wanted his son to realize _ .	"There once lived a rich businessman who had a lazy son. The businessman wanted his son to realize the value of labour and said: ""Today, I want you to go out and earn something, failing which you won't have your meals tonight."" He went crying straight to his mother. Her heart melted at her son's eyes. She gave him a gold coin. When the father asked his son what he had earned, the son presented him the gold coin. The father asked him to throw it into a well. The next day, he asked his son to earn something. This time he went crying to his sister who gave him a coin. When he showed it to his father he again asked him to throw it in a well. Then the father asked him to earn more money. This time since there was no one to help him, the son was forced to go to the market. One shopkeeper told him he would pay him two coins if he carried his trunk to his house. He did so and sweated plenty. As he returned home he was asked to do the same. The son almost cried out. He could not imagine throwing his hard-earned money like this. He cried, ""My entire body is aching. You are asking me to throw the money into the well."" At this moment, the businessman told him one feels the pain only when the fruits of hard labour are wasted. On the earlier two occasions he was helped and therefore had no pain in throwing the coins into the well. The son had now realized the value of hard work. He promised never to be lazy and to safely keep the father's wealth. The father handed over the keys of his shop to the son and promised to guide him through the rest of the life."

What must you reevaluate constantly?	"One of the keys to being successful is persistence .Once you have determined exactly what you want to achieve, you must take active action in order to succeed. One of the things you'll notice on your journey towards your goal are roadblocks. That is, you will come across obstacles to discourage your progress. Actually, they are a part of life. Everyone would have every success they ever wanted if there were no obstacles. Your job is to be persistent and work through those obstacles. If you find little or no obstacles along the way, chances are that you are not really challenging yourself. And when you do reach your goal, you won't experience the feeling of ""sweet success"". Make your goal a challenging one! If you take the time to study any successful person, you will learn that the vast majority of them have had more ""failures"" than they have had ""successes"". This is because successful people are persistent; the more they stumble and fall, the more they get right back up and get going again. On the other hand, people that don't get back up and try again, never reach success. For example, Walt Disney was turned down 302 times before he got financing for his dream of creating the ""Happiest Place on Earth"". Today, due to his persistence, millions of people have shared ""the joy of Disney"". Having known these facts, keep in mind that you must constantly reevaluate your circumstances and the approach you are using to reach your goal. There is no sense in being persistent at something that you are doing incorrectly! Sometimes you have to modify your approach along the way. Every time you do something you learn from it, and therefore find a better way to do it the next time. Today is the day to begin your journey, using consistency and persistency, towards tomorrow's successes!"	['Circumstances and ways.']
What can we infer from TSA's statement?	"The European Union on Monday prohibited the use of X-ray body scanners in European airports, parting ways with the U. S. Transportation Security Administration, which has used hundreds of the scanners as a way to screen millions of airline passengers for explosives hidden under clothing. The European Commission, which enforces common policies of the EU's 27 member countries, adopted the rule ""in order not to risk doing harm to citizens' health and safety."" As a ProPublica/PBS NewsHour investigation detailed earlier this month, X-ray body scanners use ionizing radiation ,a form of energy that has been shown to damage DMA and cause cancer. Although the amount of radiation is extremely low, equal to the radiation a person would receive in a few minutes of flying, several research studies have concluded that a small number of cancer cases would result from scanning hundreds of millions of passengers a year. European countries will be allowed to use an alternative body scanner relying on radio frequency waves, which have not been linked to cancer. The U. S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has also used hundreds of those machines --known as millimeter-wave scanners --in U. S. airports. But unlike Europe, it has decided to use both types of scanners. The TSA would not comment specifically on the EU 's decision. But in a statement, TSA spokesman Mike McCarthy said, ""As one of our many layers of security, TSA uses the most advanced technology available to provide the best opportunity to detect dangerous items, such as explosives. "" We strictly test our technology to ensure it meets our high detection and safety standards before it is placed in airports,"" he continued. ""Since January 2010, advanced imaging technology has detected more than 300 dangerous or illegal items on passengers in U. S. airports nationwide."" Body scanners have been controversial in the United States since they were first used in prisons in the late 1990s and then in airports for tests after 9/11."

Ned wrote to Alice almost every day because he .	"When she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to work in the store , Alice had dated a young man. The young man, named Ned Currie, was older than Alice. He was employed on the local newspaper and for a long time he went to see Alice almost every evening. Together the two walked under the trees through the streets of the town and talked of what they would do with their lives. Alice was then a very pretty girl and one night Ned took her into his arms and kissed her. He became excited and said things he did not intend to say and Alice, betrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come into her narrow life, also grew excited. She also talked. The outer crust of her life , all of her natural shyness and reserve, was torn away and she gave herself over to the emotions of love. When,late in the fall,Ned went away to Cleveland to try to get a place on a city newspaper and rise in the world , she wanted to go with him. _ she told him what was in her mind. ""I will work and you can work,she said. ""I don't want to tie you to a needless expense that will stop you making progress. Don't marry me now. We'll get along without that and we can be together. Even though we live in the same house, no one will say anything. In the city we'll be unknown and people will pay no attention to us."" Ned was puzzled by his sweetheart's determination and was also deeply touched. He had wanted a girlfriend just to relieve the boredom of his life but had changed his mind. He now wanted to protect her and care for her. ""You don't know what you're talking about,he said sharply; ""I'll let you do no such thing. As soon as I get a good job , I'll come back. For the present you'll have to stay here. It's the only thing we can do. On the evening before he left Winesburg, Ned went to call on Alice. They walked about through the streets for an hour and then went for a drive in the country. The moon came up and they found themselves unable to talk. They stopped at a place where a long meadow ran down to the bank of Wine Creek and there in the dim light he kissed her and promised he would love her forever. When they returned to town, it did not seem to them that anything in the future could blot out the wonder and beauty of that evening. ''Now we will have to stick to each other; whatever happens, we will have to do that,"" Ned said as he left the girl at her father's door. He did not succeed in getting a place on a Cleveland newspaper and went west to Chicago. For a time he was lonely and wrote to Alice almost every day. Then he was caught up by the life of the city ;he began to make friends and found new interests in life. In Chicago he boarded at a house where there were several women. One of them attracted his attention and he forgot Alice in Winesburg. At the end of a year he had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long time when he was lonely or when he went into one of the city parks and saw the moon shining on the grass as it had shone that night on the meadow by Wine Creek did he think of her at all."

According to the passage, the new trend to name a child includes all below EXCEPT _ .	According to a handful of studies, a name not only reveals clues about a person's class, education and ethnic origin, it can also influence the bearer of the name and the choices they make in life. Scientists have even drawn conclusions to suggest that people are often drawn to things and people that sound like their own names. These experts claim that 'implicit egotism' is the reason that someone called Dennis might become a dentist or even that a child whose name begins with a B or C may perform worse in school examinations. That a person's name may be bound to his or her destiny is far from a new phenomenon. The Ancient Romans promoted the concept 'nomenest omen', meaning 'name is destiny.' Studies have indeed shown that those with more conservative names are more successful when applying for a job. And a recent survey conducted in Australia revealed that people respond more warmly to colleagues and politicians with names they can easily pronounce. Yet parents nowadays are putting that much more effort into giving their children original names that are largely unfamiliar. Though historically names from the Bible have been passed down through families, in recent days the tendency has been to think outside the box and consider movies, songs and stories for inspiration. When Britney Spears rose to fame the slightly altered Brittaney became wildly popular among new parents and recently, thanks to the Twilight series, Isabella has made a comeback. One study found that 30 percent of African American girls born in California during the 1990s were given unique names that they shared with not a single person born in the same year in the same state. Dr Martin Ford of George Mason University, however, believes a name does not stand for much. He explained to The Week: 'Names only have a significant influence when that is the only thing you know about the person. Add a picture, and the impact of the name weakens. Add information about personality, motivation, and ability, and the impact of the name shrinks to minimal significance.'	['ad']
It can be inferred that _ can make Chinese feel most proud.	"What image does the word ""Britain"" conjure up in your mind? Big Ben,the frequently changing weather, fish and chips... But have you ever wondered what British people think means ""Britain""? English playwright William Shakespeare and pop group The Beatles are the icons which inspire a sense of national pride in British people, according to a recent survey. More than 2,000 people were asked what aspect of Britain made them feel most proud. Shakespeare topped the list, followed by the National Trust, a charity which protects places of historical or environmental interest. These beat the British currency, the pound, and the BBC. Surprisingly, the royal family only made it to seventh on the list. ""The royal family, while popular, does not inspire widespread pride,"" said a spokesman for Demos, the think tank which carried out the research. ""However, it is certainly the case that -- through their unique capacity to hold and lead national events -- the royal family has a central role to play in developing pride."" Terence Blacker, a reporter for The Independent, believes the study shows the nature of new patriotism . ""It turns out that modern British patriotism is not really about nationhood at all,"" he wrote. According to the poll, the most impressive symbols of national pride concerned private conduct and character. Volunteering topped the list, followed by politeness and patience."	['Luxun.']
Glenn Doman discovered in his research that brain-damaged children improved then they _ .	"An American psychotherapist Glenn Doman wrote a best-selling book calledHow to Teach Your Baby to Readin 1963. Now translated into 17 languages, this book arose from his work with brain-damaged children in Pennsylvania. Doman and his team of specialists had wondered why brain-injured children didn't improve with treatment. Then they realized that orthodox methods of treatment only relieved the symptoms, not the problem, which of course was the brain itself. So they develop a new approach. ""All we do for all the children here is to give them visual, auditory and tactile stimulation with increased frequency, intensity and duration, in recognition of the orderly way in which the brain grows,"" says Doman. ""The result was that by 1960 we had hundreds of severely brain-injured two-year-olds who could read and understand."" The team had discovered that even children who had half their brains removed could, by stimulation, achieve higher IQs than the average normal child. Then the team began to think if such amazing results could be achieved with brain-damaged children, what would happen if the same treatment were given to normal children? So eight years ago the Better Baby Institute was opened for the benefit of normal children. The same stimulating environment was provided, and by the time the children left, around seven years old, they could generally speak and read three foreign languages, play a musical instrument, read three full-length books a week and do all the other things that a so-called ""normal"" child could do. In Doman's view, the child's passion to learn during the years up to six must be fed. He believes that, like muscles, the brain develops with use, especially so in those first few years. Nowadays, parents come from all over the world to Pennsylvania to see and learn from the workof Doman and his team; they want to discover how they can fulfill their roles as nature's teachers, by using their love, understanding and instincts for the benefit of the children. For in the words of Doman, ""every child born has a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci used""."	['got the right treatment']
Which language did the cat learn as a second language?	"There was once a young mouse that lived in a hole in a wall. One day, the young mouse woke up from his sleep and looked out of the hole. As he looked out, a fantastic smell came to his nose. ""Cheese!"" the mouse said happily to himself. ""I'll go and get it now and have it for breakfast."" But then he remembered his parents' words. His parents were very clever mice and often said to their son, ""Always wait before you go for a piece of cheese."" So the young mouse waited quietly. Then he heard a quiet ""Miaow"" and he knew the cat was there. He stayed in the hole and said to himself, ""I'm glad I listened to my parents and learned to wait."" The next day, he looked out again. He put his nose out of the hole, and the beautiful smell of cheese came to his nose again. He could see the cheese. It was only a few centimetres away. But he sat still and waited quietly. This time he did not hear any cat's noise. Instead he heard a very quiet ""Woof, woof."" ""It's a dog!"" he thought. ""If the dog is there, the cat won't be there. I expect the dog has chased the cat away, so I'm safe."" The mouse ran out of the hole and started eating the cheese. He did not see the cat, which caught him and ate him. When the cat finished her meal, she said to herself, ""I'm glad I listened to my parents and learned a second language."""	['Dog language.']
Why was the youngest often scolded by his mother?	"The story began with a young mother who had three sons. Unfortunately, the youngest son developed slow thinking skills, not having the intelligence of his brothers. With double duty as the mother of the household, she was exhausted, so that the youngest was often the target of anger and annoyance. Bad words, such as ""you little fool"" and the like, served as a daily meal for the youngest. The words and curses he got from the mother and ridicule from friends convinced him that he was distressing and embarrassing his family. Every morning he woke up with his own face staring from the mirror reflection, he started to say quietly and sadly, ""The fool is going to school."" As adult citizens, there was compulsory military service which should be lived. Thus, the youngest son also signed up and started to follow the various tests: a medical, physical ability test and other tests. On the day of the announcement, he was called into the board of examiners. In his mind, he convinced himself that he was the fool and couldn't pass the tests this time as he entered the room with his head down. It was not expected at all. The tests turned out to have the highest praise from the board of examiners. ""Congratulations, young man! Your test results are incredible! You are really a great and talented young man. ""Words from the board of examiners became the discovery of a new side of himself that was not known in advance. Voice kept echoing in his mind, such as ""I, the great man, am in the shower"", ""The great man washes his face"", ""The talented young man again brushes his teeth"" and so on. Confidence and improved self-image came beyond usual. 20 years later, the youngest established himself as a successful businessman who was admired and respected, and received many awards. The mindset and belief are the power behind the success that is within us. Whatever we think and believe in or minds continuously, it will eventually materialize in reality. That's the universally applicable law."	['He was not as clever as his brothers.']

'How many roses can I buy for only five dollars , madam?' he asks. The shopkeeper tells him that a dozen of roses is forty dollars. Maybe he can buy some carnations . They are much cheaper. 'No, I only want to have red roses,' he says. 'My mum was badly ill and I didn't spend much time with her. Now I want to give her something special, it must be roses because rose is her favorite.' After hearing it, John says he can help him pay for the rest of the money. The shopkeeper is moved and says, 'Well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you.'

Seeing this, John turns and quickly walks to the shop. He will take the flowers home himself.	"[""can't tell his mother he loved her himself""]"
In ancient China, only wealthy people could afford clothes made from _ .	China is home to the invention of silk and has a long tradition of producing fine materials for clothing. Not all clothing in ancient or contemporary( ) China is made of silk, however. In fact, silk was only available to the wealthy classes for much of China's history. Until the introduction of cotton during the Ming Dynasty, from the 14th to the 17th century, the poorer classes wore rough clothing made from fibers . In ancient China, the tunic was particularly popular . Called hanfu , both men and women could be seen wearing tunics made of different materials. Women's tunics were long and loose , extending all the way down to their feet and often _ with a belt or rope to get tighter . Men's tunics were shorter, usually only extending down to their knees. During the winter, both men and women would wear cotton jackets for warmth. In the winter, men would also wear pants or ankle-length skirts into their clothes to keep warm and protect their legs against the cold winter conditions. Contemporary Chinese clothing is now made of many of the same materials as contemporary clothing found in other countries. Much of the traditional Chinese clothing produced now is made of cotton and silk, but generally contemporary Chinese clothing also contains synthetic fibers in with the cotton and silk, such as nylon . In addition, linen is now commonly used in contemporary Chinese clothing, especially during the summer months because it is light and breathable.	['silk']
Which of the following is the best title?	"When you discuss about eating out with your friend, first of all, you must make it clear who will pay for the meal.If somebody suggests having lunch with his friend, he might simply say something like this ""I'm afraid it'll have to be some place nearby ,as I have little money."" The other person may say. ""OK. I'll meet you at Mcdonald's."" This means he has agreed that the two will go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He may say ""Oh, no. I want to take you for lunch at Johnson's "" This means the person is to pay the bill for both of them. Although the other person is pleased with the invitation, there is one reason why he shouldn't accept it by simply saying ""Thank you."" American customs are much the same as those in other parts of the world. American women used to expect men to pay for all the meals. But today, some of them like to. However, if a woman is asked to attend a dinner or a dance outside, the invitaton itself means ""Come as my guest"". So, as you see, it is a polite thing to make the situation clear at the very beginning."	['Who pays the bill']
When the author had his unforgettable family vacation, _ .	Before summer ends, you might want to consider reading The Shaping of A Christian Home by Elizabeth Elliot. She writes beautifully of her family summer cottage in Franconia, Maine. She mentions that every family should have a place to get away together. The summer of my fourteenth year, Dad and Mom planned a wonderful family vacation that I'll never forget. We took a road trip in our 1969 Chrysler. We camped through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and back home by way of Washington D.C. To save money, we stayed in a tent and cooked our own meals on a camp stove. It was a wonderful vacation. Whenever we could, we talked Dad into staying at a campground with a swimming pool. We camped in a large tent big enough to sleep eight average-sized people who didn't mind sleeping close enough to hear one another breathe. It wasn't a cottage in Franconia, but served a similar purpose for our family. Most nights I slept in my own small tent. Each night I went to sleep listening to the music or sleep to the sound of frogs. In Maine, we didn't have a cottage in the mountains or a house on the lake. I doubt if we ever will. But I have happy memories of a family vacation, looking into a campfire, swimming with my brothers and my sister and walking under the stars.	['he was a teenager']

Sadly, she went to the holy man and asked, ""What magical things do you have to bring my son back to life?"" Instead of sending her away or reasoning with her, he said to her, ""Fetch me a mustard seed from a home that has never known sadness. We will use it to drive the sadness out of your life."" The woman happily went off at once in search of that magical mustard seed. She first came to a splendid house, knocked at the door and said, ""I am looking for a home that has never known sadness. Is it such a place? It is very important to me."" They told her ""You've certainly come to the wrong place"" and began to describe all the tragic things that had happened to them recently. The woman said to herself, ""I have had misfortune of my own. Who is able to help these poor, unfortunate people?"" She stayed to comfort them, and then went on in search of a home that had never known sadness. But wherever she went, she found one tale after another of sadness and misfortune. She became so involved in other people's sorrow that finally she forgot about her search for the magical mustard seed, never realizing that it had, in fact, driven the sadness out of her life."

Why did Franklin regret a youthful event that he did?	"Benjamin Franklin is remembered as an inventor, author, statesman, and signer of the Declaration of Independence. But all great people were kids once and got into naughty. In writing about his life, Franklin recalled a youthful event that he later regretted. Franklin was born in Boston in 1706. His father, whom Ben admired and respected, was a soapmaker and candlemaker with a large family. At the age of ten, Ben was taken out of school and put to work in the shop. Ben described his duties as ""cutting wick for the candles, filling the dipping mold .But of course he preferred playing outdoors with his friends. One such plot is told here in his own words. ""There was a saltwetland that bounded part of the millpond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows . By much abuse, we had made it a only quagmire . My proposal was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large pile of stones, which were intended for a new house near the wetland, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I gathered a number of my playfellows, and working with them diligently like so many ants, sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made after the removers;we were discovered and complained of;several of us were corrected by our fathers;and, though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest."""

We can infer from the passage that_.	"DID you get a flu shot this year? For the first time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the prefix = st1 /USis recommending that all children aged from 6 months to 18 years receive the flu vaccine. Vaccines battle diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. A weakened form of the germ is introduced into the body. The body makes special substances called antibodies to fight the germs. If the actual germs were to attack, the antibodies would fight it. Because there are many kinds of flu viruses, scientists must create a new vaccine formula each year. Researchers must make a prediction. It is like forecasting the weather. Sometimes they are right on, and sometimes they are off. But even when the vaccinedoes not closely match circulating flu types, it can make the illness less serious. ""The flu vaccine is not as effective as the polio vaccine or the measles vaccine,"" says Dr William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ""It's not a great vaccine, but it is quite a good vaccine."" But a flu vaccine doesn't work for everyone. There are certain people who should be careful about taking it. Because the vaccine is produced in eggs, those who are allergic to eggs should not take it. If you have a fever, you should wait until you recover. Some people are afraid that they might get the flu from the flu shot. Scientists say that it is not possible, because the viruses in the flu shot are inactivated. But some minor side effects such as low-grade fever and body ache could occur. If they do, they begin soon after the shot and usually last only one to two days. Did you know? Smallpox was the first disease people tried to prevent by putting a virus into a healthy person. In 1796, English scientist Edward Jenner placed some infected material under a boy's skin."

What is the main idea of this reading?	Many cultures have different ideas about why people catch colds. For example in the United States, some people think that you can catch a cold if your feet get cold. So, mothers tell small children to wear warm boots in the winter. In other places, including parts of the Middle East, some people believe that strong winds cause colds. So, on trains and buses, people usually don't like to sit next to open windows. In parts of Europe, some people think that wearing wet clothes will give you a cold. They say that after you go swimming, you should quickly put on dry clothes.

What do we learn about Sophie from the passage?	"When my daughter, Sophie, was admitted to a college we were very happy, but a little worried about becoming empty nesters. I knew I had to do something to help myself adapt, starting with the summer before she left. Sophie had a pack of colorful T-shirts. I knew she wouldn't wear them any more, so I decided to make a quilt out of them for her bed at college. It focused my energy, and also let me relive some memories. I tried to work on the quilt when Sophie wasn't at home----which turned out to be often. She was very busy with her friends. Even when she was around, her door was shut more than usual. I felt a bit hurt. After all, we didn't have much time together before she went to college, I was already missing her, and she hadn't ever left yet. When we arrived at the college, a wave of emotion flooded me. I tried to hold it back, but Sophie saw it in my face. She took a big red book from her bag. ""I made this for you, Mom,"" she said. Then I knew why she had been staying behind a closed door that summer. It was an album of photographs documenting the life of our family over the last 17 years. I broke into tears. Some of it was sadness at having to let her go, but some of it was joy. I knew that our connection was more powerful than ever, and that we'd always be connected by the strongest of threads, the love that went into every stitch of her quilt and every photo of my album. In Sophie's dormitory I unfolded the quilt on her bed. For a moment she was speechless. Then she threw her arms around me. ""Mom, I love you,"" she said. One of her new friends was calling her outside. Sophie turned, and I let her go."	['She made a photo album to show her love.']
Many people think the reason for the flooding of the Missouri River is _ .

Army Corps of Engineers upriver, his theory aims to look deeper into the root of the problem. ""The Missouri River is flooding,"" said Dr. James Hansen, Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, during a visit to Omaha on Tuesday.""We've had floods that usually only happen once in every hundred years a couple of times on the Missouri River recently. That's one of the expected consequences of the increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide."" Hansen, who is considered to be one of the world's leading experts on global warming , said the Missouri River is an example of how global warming is affecting the earth .""Unless you do statistics ,and you see that the frequency of these events is changing , it's not so easy to see that changes are occurring , because the climate system has large inertia ,""he said . Hansen explained, ""The ocean is four kilometers deep, and the ice sheets are two or three kilometers thick , so they don't respond immediately as we begin to change the atmospheric composition .We've only experienced about half of the warming that will be caused by the gases already in the atmosphere .The full effect is going to be felt by our children and grandchildren .And if we continue to increase the amount of CO2, the effect will be even larger."" Hansen drew a comparison, ""If we spend more money than what we're taking in , we're leaving a debt for our children and grandchildren to deal with .""According to Hansen, the responsibility lies in effective policy making to fight against global warming .That includes a gradual reduction in carbon emissions .Hansen suggests that a rising price be placed on carbon emissions, which should be collected from the fossil fuel companies at the first sale . Without effective measures taken by the government, Hansen said the public could expect more of the recent extreme weather patterns,, including more severe droughts and floods in the decades ahead ."

Eating sometimes begins with our eyes because _ .	"In 1975, George Carlin appeared on a popular TV show, Saturday Night Live, with his famous words about blue food. ""Why is there no blue food? I can't find blue food--I can't find the flavor of blue! I mean yellow is lemon; orange is orange and red is cherry. Where is the blue food? "" Well, Carlin pretty much has it right--there's not no blue food, but there's certainly not a lot of it. Fresh-picked blueberries are blue, though they become purple when they are turned into jam. The blue in blueberries--like the purple in grapes and the red in tomatoes--is found in nature. But it isn't a hot color for food. People don't seem to prefer blue food. Some diet programs even suggest that those determined to lose weight should make their food blue. Eating, in part, begins with our eyes. Charles Spence--an experimental psychologist from Oxford University--points out that color can change our taste experience. Commonly, we consider red-colored foods up to 20% sweeter than they actually are; and green foods as being more sour. Spence suggests: human expectations may be influenced by our long history of watching - green fruits can become sweet as they grow up and turn red. But what about blue? Except blueberries, much of the blue food we see these days _ blue artificially. Food producers argue that artificial color doesn't do much harm to health. A lot of research shows that some physical problems of kids are related to food dyes--while other studies show no effects at all. Blue birthday cake or even blue-dyed chicken can be served on the dinner table. So what?"	['our taste experience can be influenced by color']

How many Chinese students are there at Valley Forge before this year?	"""Beating is a sign of affection, cursing is a sign of love."" Many may not expect to hear the words of the old Chinese saying in these modern Times-- with parents wealthier and better educated than they have ever been--but experts say they still ring true. Today,it seems,Chinese parents are more likely to send their children to precollege military academies in the United States in the hope that some tough love will pave the way to success. ""Good education doesn't mean letting your children enjoy privileges, especially our boys."" said Song Wenming,an entrepreneur in Jinhua,East China's Zhejiang province.

Now, three months later, he has perfected the art of taking a bath in 35 seconds, finishing a meal without looking at his food, and making his bed with precision. He can even take criticism,no matter how unreasonable. ""The training is hard but I know it is good for selfdevelopment of individuals."" said SongSiyu. ""The endless training and scolding are just ways to build up our character;they are not personal."" But his enthusiasm is not universal. Ten of the 13 Chinese students who joined the academy this year have transferred to other schools. But for those who stick to it, there is a reward for all the hard work."	['25.']

It can be known from the passage that Bruce Hoffman was _	Millions of sports lovers are still thinking about one thing----the Winter Olympics in Sochi Russia. Close to 2900 men and women competed in the 2014 Winter Games about a month ago. The Olympics brought a lot of attention to Sochi, a city on the Black Sea, which is a popular area for vacation travelers. The area is known for its mild winters. At least $50 billion was spent on the 2014 Winter Games, making it the costliest Olympics in history. Seven billion dollars was spent on the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. Olympic officials chose Sochi to host the 2014 games almost seven years ago. At that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the games would cost about $13 billion. Yet the actual expenses exceeded his estimate. So where did all the money go? Some observers say the high cost is partly the result of security measures. Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert from the RAND Corporation, gave the following explanation. There were anywhere between 70,000 and 100, 000 policemen and military troops deployed around the city. The main threat came from separatist and Islamist groups from the North Caucasus, especially from Chechnya and Dagestan. One group claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in Volgograd last December. The attacks killed more than 30 people. The city is only about 600 kilometers away from Sochi. Bruce Hoffman is a terrorism expert from Georgetown University in Washington DC. He says the increased security made Sochi a difficult target for terrorists. It is thought that the terrorists' intention was to make life difficult for the Russians and to create some sort of incident that would take away the enjoyment. The last Olympians from around the world on Russian soil were in 1980. That was a year after Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan. More than sixty countries didn't take part in the Moscow Summer Games to show their anger.	['a terrorism expert from the USA']
According to the passage, Take our Daughters to work Day is _ .	"Cara Lang is 13. She lives in Boston, Massachusetts, in the U. S. Last Thursday, she didn't go to school. She went to work with her father instead. Every year, on the fourth Thursday in April, millions of young girls go work. This is Take Our Daughters to Work Day. The girls are between the ages of 9 and 15. They spend the day at work with an adult, usually a mother, father, aunt, or uncle. They go to offices, police stations, laboratories, and other places where their parents or other family members work. Next year, the day will include sons, too. The Ms. Foundation, an organization for women, started the program about ten years ago. In the U.S., many women work outside the home. The Ms. Foundation wanted girls to find out about many different kinds of jobs. Then, when the girls grow up, they can choose a job they like. Cara's father is a film director. Cara says, ""It was very exciting for me to go to the studio with my dad. I saw a lot of people doing different jobs."" Many businesses have special activities for girls on this day. Last year, Cara went to work with her aunt at the University of Massachusetts. In the engineering department, the girls learned to build a bridge with toothpicks and Candy. In the chemistry department, they learned to use scales. They learned about many other kinds of jobs, too. Right now, Cara does not know what job she will have when she grows up. But because of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, she knows she has many choices."	['a day for girls to know about jobs']
What do we know about the writer?	"One night I was sitting in my room half-listening as my 15-year-old brother Tommy fought with my 12-year-old brother Kevin. I didn't pay attention when Kevin rushed up the stairs with the hurt on his face. About 20 minutes later, as I was walking upstairs I heard Kevin crying inside the bathroom. I knocked on the door and asked, ""Hey Kevin, do you want to talk?"" No answer. I tried again, ""Why don't you come out of there?"" Again, no answer. So, joking around, I grabbed a stack of cards and a pencil and wrote, ""If you don't want to talk, we can write notes to each other."" An hour later I was still sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and one was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his _ feelings into words for me. As I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, ""Nobody in this family cares about me. I'm not the youngest, and I'm not the oldest. Tommy thinks I'm silly and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even notice me."" Tears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. ""You know Kevin, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it. I am here for you and you are loved in this family."" There was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of cards wrote on a torn paper cup. ""Thanks."" I wrote back ""For what?"" it returned to me with ""Loving me"" on it. Since then, I try my best to never only half-notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer relationship now. And sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset, we'll smile and say ""Write it on a paper cup."""	"[""She didn't pay enough attention to Kevin before.""]"
Why did the boy who called the writer want Minnie?	"Last summer vacation, I volunteered to work at a vet's . There I saw a lot of dogs. Minnie was the funniest-looking dog I'd ever seen. _ She was brought to the vet because her owners didn't want her any more. I thought Minnie had a sweet personality, though.""No one should judge her by her looks,""I thought. Finally, I advertised Minnie in the local paper.""Funny-looking dog, well-behaved, needs a loving family."" When a boy called, I warned him that Minnie was strange-looking. The boy on the phone told me that his grandfather's sixteen-year-old dog had just died. They wanted Minnie no matter what. I gave Minnie a good bath. Then we waited for them to arrive. At last, an old car pulled up in front of the vet's. Two kids raced to the door. They picked Minnie up and rushed her out to their grandfather, who was waiting in the car. I hurried behind them to see his reaction to Minnie. Inside the car, the grandfather held Minnie in his arms and _ her soft hair. She licked his face. Her tail wagged around so quickly that it looked like it might fly off her body. ""She's perfect!""the old man said happily. I was thankful that Minnie had found a good home. Suddenly, I saw that the grandfather's eyes were a milky white colour--he was blind."	"[""Because his grandfather's dog had just died.""]"
Before becoming Modern English, English was called _ by language experts.	"More and more people are trying to learn English than any other language in the world. English is the world language of politics and international business. It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on. In most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there. Do you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as ""damage"","" prison ""and "" marriage"". Then, English became what language experts called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today. ,."

In the study,the women were supposed to give the opinions about _ .	"The producers of instant coffee found their product strongly resisted in the market places despite their product's obvious advantages. Furthermore,the advertising expense for instant coffee was far greater than that for regular coffee. Efforts were made to find the cause of the users' seemingly unreasonable resistance to the product. The reason given by most people was dislike for the taste. The producers doubt that there might be deeper reasons,however. This was supported by one of motivation research's classic studies,one often cited in the trade. Mason Haire of the University of California constructed two shopping lists that were the same except for one item. There were six items common to both lists: hamburger,carrots,bread,baking powder,canned peaches,and potatoes,with the brands or amounts specified. The seventh item,in fifth place on both lists,read""lib. Maxwell House coffee""on one list and""Nescafe instant coffee""on the other. One list was given to each one in a group of fifty women,and the other list to those in another group of the same size. The women were asked to study their lists and then to describe,as far as they could,the kind of woman(personality and character)who would draw up that shopping list. Nearly half of those who had received the list including instant coffee described a housewife who was lazy and a poor planner. On the other hand,only one woman in the other group described the housewife,who had included regular coffee on,her list was lazy; only six of that group suggested that she was a poor planner. Eight women felt that the instant-coffee user was probably not a good wife!No one in the other group drew such a conclusion about the housewife who intended to buy regular coffee."

What made the author's getting up late early worthwhile?	"The freezing Northeast hasn't been a terribly fun place to spend time this winter, so when the chance came for a weekend to Sarasota, Florida, my bags were packed before you could say ""sunshine"". I left for the land of warmth and vitamin C(C), thinking of beaches and orange trees. When we touched down to blue skies and warm air, I sent up a small prayer of gratefulness. Swimming pools, wine tasting, and pink sunsets(at normal evening hours, not 4 in the afternoon) filled the weekend, but the best part- particularly to my taste, dulled by months of cold- weather root vegetables- was a 7 a.m. adventure to the Sarasota farmers' market that proved to be more than worth the early wake-up call. The market, which was founded in 1979, sets up its tents every Saturday from 7:00 am to 1 p.m, rain or shine, along North Lemon and State streets. Baskets of perfect red strawberries, the red-painted sides of the Java Dawg coffee truck; and most of all, the tomatoes: amazing, large, soft and round red tomatoes. Disappointed by many a broken, vine-ripened promise, I've refused to buy winter tomatoes for years. No matter how attractive they look in the store, once I get them home they're unfailingly dry, hard, and tasteless. But I homed in, with uncertainty, on one particular table at the Brown's Grove Farm's stand, full of fresh and soft tomatoes the size of my fist. These were the real deal- and at that moment, I realized that the best part of Sarasota in winter was going to be eating things that back home in New York I wouldn't be experiencing again for months. Delighted as I was by the tomatoes in sight, my happiness deepened when I learned that Brown's Grove Farm is one of the suppliers for Jack Dusty, a newly opened restaurant at the Sarasota Ritz Carlton, where- luckily for me- I was planning to have dinner that very night. Without even seeing the menu, I knew I'd be ordering every tomato on it."	"[""Visiting a local farmer's market.""]"

Bensmania tested monkeys to prove that the feeling of touch _ .	"An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched. Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys . The scientists implanted electrodes --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers "" a nice clear pathway"" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee or someone with a injury of spinal cord. The study shows how artificial limbs might be connected to the brain so that a person can ""feel"" with such a prosthesis . But such a supersensory device doesn't exist yet and scientists have a lot of work to do before people will benefit from it. Researchers must first figure out whether the electrodes would work in people in the same way they do in monkeys. "" I think the foundation is laid for human trials,"" Bensmaia said."

What kind of drinks should you take when you are really thirsty?	Being fit is a way of saying a person eats well, gets a lot of physical activities, and has a healthy weight. If you're fit, your body works well, feels good, and can do all the things you want to do, like running around with your friends. Some steps only parents can take - such as serving healthy meals or deciding to take the family on a nature hike. Here are three rules you can follow, if you're a kid who wants to be fit. 1. Eat _ Foods You may have a favorite food, but the best choice is to eat a variety. Taste new foods and old ones you haven't tried for a while. Some foods, such as green vegetables, are more pleasing than the older you get. Take at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day - two fruits and three vegetables. 2. Drink Water & Milk When you're really thirsty, you can drink cold water. It's also enough to drink 2 or 3 cups of milk a day. 3. Listen to Your Body When you're eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach feels comfortably full. Sometimes, people eat too much because they don't notice when they need to stop eating. Eating too much can make you feel uncomfortable and can make you put on weight.	['Cold water']

What would be the best title for the passage?	Clean water is not only important for food production, but necessary for our life. However, large numbers of people in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are going without. The World Health Organization reports that almost 4,000 children die each day for dirty water or lack of water. Agriculture is the primary user of water at 70-85% of fresh water in the world. Industrial uses of water don't often come to mind, but you may be surprised to know that industry uses 59% of the water supply in developed countries. Home use takes up only 8% in the world. But as cities grow, the local government has to cut down on water use. Many cities are turning to privatization of water as a method of controlling use. The poor are paying as much as a quarter of their monthly income for water in some developing countries. In 60% of large European cities, groundwater is being used at a faster rate. People are saving water by simply using less and being careful with what they do use. Sometimes it's as simple as not throwing out water that they could use elsewhere. In Australia overuse of water has always been a problem. The Australian government has encouraged households and industries to collect rainwater and reuse water from showers. Technology is helping householders for shower and bath water for reuse in toilets or gardens. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a water saving program designed to encourage families and businesses to examine their water use and save more water. Good water management has been considered by scientists and the UN as the key to solving the water problem. We can all work together to protect our valuable water in our daily life.

.Does a mother kangaroo have a pocket?	There are forty-seven different kinds of kangaroos . The smallest kangaroos are about a quarter of a meter long; the biggest are taller than a man. Kangaroos have very long strong back legs. These are used for jumping. They also have long strong tails used for resting on. Kangaroos' front legs are much shorter, and are almost like arms. Kangaroos' heads are quite small, but their ears are quite large. Mother kangaroos have a pocket at the front. They have one baby each year. When it is born, the baby kangaroo is straight into its mother's pocket. The baby kangaroos stay there for six months. The biggest kangaroos stand more than 2 meters tall, and their legs are so strong that they can jump more than 9 meters. They are very fast, and can travel at more than 50 kilometers an hour. They are very strong, but only eat fruit, leaves and grass.	['Yes, it does.']

Why are Japanese cellphone makers a little too clever?	"TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores. The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm. And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois. This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global. ""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access. Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets. Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves. ""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan."

If you want to keep healthy, you had better _	Passage 3 A smile will tell people around you that you are a kind and friendly person. However, many people don't smile because they think they have ugly teeth. For example, one of my classmates, Mike, doesn't have very nice teeth, so that is why he seldom opens his mouth. He even says that he has lost confidence because of his teeth. So it is very important for us to look after our teeth. In fact, a lot of people have this problem. Some people inherit teeth problems from their parents, while others' teeth are damaged because of bad habits, like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar or not brushing teeth often. If your teeth are in bad shape, you should see a dentist and ask for help. They can help improve your teeth and tell you how to take care of them. Smiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh. An Indian doctor called Kataria said that young children should laugh about 30 times a day, while adults should laugh between 7 and 15 times a day. So please take this chance to smile and laugh now.

According to the article, meditation is helpful mainly because _ .	Everyone wants to achieve true happiness in life. But the biggest factor holding most of us back is actually our ownselves. The Huffington Post released a list of seven mistakes we need to let go of in order to become happier people. Let's take a look. 1.Placing too much emphasis on fulfillment Those who put a lot of pressure on themselves to be happy feel more lonely on a daily basis than those who do not, according to research conducted at the University of Denver, US. 2. Keeping it all in Keeping it all together during tough times can hurt you. Crying is the body's emotional response to outside triggers .By _ it, you may be damaging your mental and physical health. 3. Looking at your smart phone all the time Connecting with others may be the key to happiness, but a recent University of Michigan study found that the more time participants spent on social networking sites, the less happy they felt. 4. Not moving It's no secret that a healthy lifestyle is a big part of happiness. Something as simple as a walk can help you increase your creativity and expose you to essential vitamins. 5. Not reflecting on the past In a 2013 study on nostalgia and emotion, participants reported a higher sense of physiological comfort when they looked back on the past. Affection for heartwarming memories helps people relate their past experiences to the present in order to create a greater sense of meaning. 6. Resisting change A study on the psychology of choices shows that the human brain naturally tries to avoid loss--but that resistance can cause stress. Whether it's fear of the unknown or fear of losing what you currently have, the pressure to hold on to the present can harm your future life satisfaction. 7. Not being mindful Setting aside time for meditation allows your body to relax, cultivates an attitude of gratitude and lowers your stress level, according to researchers at University of California, Los Angeles, US.

From the text, we can infer that _ .	If You Make a Mistake, Don't Worry! Yeah, you'll want to forget about them, but mistakes can be useful. Making a mistake doesn't mean it's the end of the world. In real life you have to grow and mature, and with that comes some growing pains. You know you should have studied hard but you went out with some friends instead. You know you should have put the money into the bank for a rainy day instead of spending it on all kinds of things you didn't need. It's the growing pains called mistakes that most people make when they are growing up. Face them. You are going to make them. Learn from them. All of the people you wish to copy, such as all the experts in your business field, have made mistakes. They'll continue to make mistakes for all their successes. One of the major differences between people like them and the vast majority of others is that they don't let their mistakes stop them. Instead, they use their mistakes as learning tools. At the very least, when you make a mistake, you'll know what not to do. And you can help others by warning them of the mistakes you've made. Don't let mistakes stop you from doing anything. Learn from them, don't hide in a closet. Facing up to your mistakes now and later will mature. What mistakes are you making right now? Take a look at anything you might be doing wrong. Take a step back and evaluate your situation, then fix whatever needs to be corrected. Then move forward. Always remember your mistakes to remind yourself of what not to do for the future.

The new product has drawn attention from some _ .	"While football fans feel strongly angry and shocked about mistakes made by referees because they cannot see clearly what has happened, a small German company is quietly pleased. For Carlos Technologies, mistakes made by referees are the kind of advertising that money cannot buy. The company has developed a tiny chip that fits inside a football and determines whether the ball has crossed the goal line, by being able to discover its exact location on the field. The world football organization, FIFA, has shown interest in the technology. It is very possible that the new technology will be used in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. ""We've been testing the technology at the main soccer stadium in Nuremberg for some time and more recently in an under-17 FIFA Cup in Peru,"" said Gunter Rohmer, a director of the company. ""The technology has performed well, and we're pretty optimistic that it will be used at the games in Russia."" The chip only weighs 12 grams, and is placed in the center of the football. It sends 2,000 signals a second to a receiver network of 12 antennas ,placed around the field. The receivers then send information about the ball's location to a central computer, and because it works in real time, it can immediately tell the referee whether a goal has been scored. The chip even can tell when the ball crosses the line in mid-air. Oliver Braun, one of the inventors of the chip, says that feedback from German referees was generally positive. Germany sports-wear giant Adidas is also optimistic about using this kind of chip in other ball sports. FIFA aims to test the technology later this year at another game in Japan before deciding whether or not to introduce it in all 12 stadiums in Russia for next World Cup."	['big companies']

What is the biggest difference between blogs and traditional websites?	"When important events are happening around the world, most people turn to traditional media sources, such as CNN and BBC for the news. However, during the war in Iraq in 2003, many people followed the war from the point of view of an unknown Iraqi citizen who called himself ""Salam Pax"", which means peace. Salam Pax wrote a diary about everyday life in Baghdad during the war, and posted it on his website. Pax's online diary was a kind of website known as a ""blog"". Blogs are online diaries, usually kept by individuals, but sometimes by companies and other groups of people. They become the fastest growing type of website on the Internet. A blog differs from a traditional website in several ways. Most importantly, it is updated much more regularly. Many blogs are updated every day, and some are updated several times a day. Also, most blogs use special software or websites, which can help ordinary people easily set up and start writing their own blogs. There are many different kinds of blogs. The most popular type is an online diary of links where the blog writer surfs the Internet and then posts links to sites or news articles that they find interesting, with a few comments about each one. Other types are personal diaries, where the writer talks about their life and feelings. Sometimes these blogs can be very personal. There is another kind of blogging, called ""moblogging"", short for ""mobile blogging"". Mobloggers use mobile phones with cameras to take photos, which are posted instantly to the Internet. The use of mobile phones in this way made the headlines in Singapore when a high school student posted a movie he had taken of a teacher shouting at another student on the Internet. Many people were shocked by what the student did, and wanted phones with cameras to be banned from schools. Many people think that as blogs become common, news reporting will rely less on big media companies, and more on ordinary people posting news to the Internet. They think that then the news will be less like a lecture, and more like a conversation, where any one can join in."	['Blogs are updated much more often.']
Which of the following sentences is TRUE?	"You may get a cold sometimes. It often starts with a sore throat. You sneeze and your nose runs. You usually have a headache, too. Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious illness, but you may feel quite bad. _ For example, you can take aspirin to get rid of your headache. It is good to rest and drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me, ""With the right medicine, the cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a week!"" Where does our medicine come from? A long time ago, people knew that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons makes a sore throat better. Now, scientists find some parts of plants can make some medicine. Because of these medicines, people now live longer than their grandparents."	['Some parts of plants may make people feel better.']
Why were over 270, 000 signatures collected?	Jamie Oliver, a lively Britain guy, loves to share his secrets. In his first television show,The Naked Chef, Oliver taught everyone to make simple but delicious food. In Jamie's Kitchen, he taught young people how to prepare meals. His next show,Jamie's School Dinners, is about changing the food that students eat. Oliver saw that some schools in Britain were serving junk food--food that is easy to eat but unhealthy. Although it can be delicious, junk food is not very good for children. It is sometimes bad for their health, because it doesn't give them the energy they need at school. They sometimes can't think well or feel down, and they sometimes put on weight. Some of the junk food that Oliver wants to change is canned spaghetti, chicken nuggets, French fries, soda, and muffins. He encourages schools to serve fresh and health meats, vegetables and fruits. He helps the school cooks to make healthy dinners without junk food. People liked Oliver's idea of bringing quality food to schools. Thousands enjoyed his television show. But Oliver wanted them to do more than just watch. At hisFeed Me Betterwebsites, he collected over 270,000 signatures from people. Oliver sent these signatures to British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Then Blair promised to help change the school kitchens, teach school cooks to make healthy food, and spend more on school dinners. Thanks to Jamie Oliver, my children will be able to enjoy more healthy meals at school.	['To put healthy food in schools.']
"The phrase ""in terms of"" in the last sentence can best be replaced by _"	"It is difficult to imagine what life will be like without memory. The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions(, ), the bases for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory. Memory can be defined as the capacity to keep information available for later use. It includes not only ""remembering"" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory is also involved when a six-year-old child learns to swing a baseball bat. Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices from storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory-storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant-access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 ""words""--ready for instant use. An average prefix = st1 /U. S. teenager probably recognizes the meaning of about 100,000 words of English. However, this is but a fraction(, ) of the total amount of information which the teenager has stored. Consider, for example, the number of faces and places that the teenager can recognize on sight. The use of words is the advanced problem-solving intelligence of human beings. A large part of a person's memory is in terms of words and combinations of words."	['expressed by']
What activity curriculums were not offered in this training school?	"Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of"" a new world"".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a ""Charlie horse"" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum."	['Digging.']

Before the year 1800, the capital of America had been located in _ .	When in 1789, George Washington became the first president of the United States, there was no permanent capital in which to house the government. During the Revolutionary War several different cities had served as the national capital. In addition, members of congress could not agree as to where this permanent capital should be located. Some officials wanted it in the north, others wanted it in the south. Each of the states hoped that the capital might lie within its own state lines. At last it was decided that the capital should occupy a section by itself, separate from any of the states. The place chosen was situated on the Potomac River. The land belonged originally to the state of Maryland, but Maryland agreed to the national government. The section was named the Washington. Work was begun on the new capital in 1791. in the year 1899 Congress occupied the new capital building at the same time the White House was opened as the home of all future presidents.

This passage is written to _ .	MERS, also known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, has made its way to the US. The second patient was in Orlando, Florida while the first reported case was in Indiana. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the disease has mainly been transmitted by close personal contact, such as directly caring for a very ill person. The virus is formally called MERS-CoV because it's part of the corona virus family that includes the common cold and severe SARS. SARS was ly easy to stop a decade ago, because it was being transmitted by caged animals in Chinese markets. MERS-CoV was first identified in people in 2012, but has been spreading rapidly since March, 2015. The vast majority of those cases occurred in Saudi Arabia. The patient in Orlando felt ill on the first flight but not ill enough to notify a doctor. Early on May 9, he apparently became concerned that he was still feeling ill, and he went to the emergency room at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. He identified himself as recently having been in Saudi Arabia, so he was quickly isolated to avoid infecting other patients. Wayne Marasco, an expert at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, said his biggest concern about MERS-CoV is how little we know about it. It's still not clear, in some instances, where the virus comes from, how it is transmitted or who is most subject.	['inform us of more information about the deadly illness MERS.']

He wants to kill the bird nearby. When he raises his gun to fire, the ant bites him in the foot. So he stops to look down and the bird flies away quickly.

If' you are finding it tough to land a job, try expanding your job-hunting plan to include thefollowing strategies: Set your target While you should always keep your opinions open to compromise, you should also be sure to target exactly what you want in a job. A specific job hunt will be more efficient than a random one . Schedule abundant interviews Use every possible method to get interviews-answering ads, using search firms, contacting companies directly, surfing the Web, and networking. Even if a job is not perfect for you, every interview can make you learn from it. Follow up Even if someone does not hire you, write them a thank-you note for the interview. Then. some weeks later, send another brief letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for-or any other position, for that matter-is open. Do this with every position you interview for, and you may just catch a break. Make it your full-time job You can't find a job by looking infrequently. You have to make time for it. If you're unemployed and looking for a job, devote as much time as you would to a full-time job. If you have a job while you're looking, figure out an organized schedule to maximize your searching time. Network vertically In the research phase of your job hunt, talk to people who are on a level above you in your desired industry. They'll have some insights that people at your own level won't have, and will be in a good position to hire you or recommend you to be hired. Keep your spirits up Looking for a job is one of the toughest things you will ever have to do. Maintain your confidence, stay persistent, and think positively, and eventually you will get a job that suits you.	['companies that provide job-hunting service']
The author believes that fear of water is _ .	Swimming is one of those activities that can be learned early in life. Little children can learn to swim as soon as they walk. In fact, you need the same skills in walking as in swimming. However, I believe that five is the best age to learn. By five or six, a child knows fear of water, a very important thing to know. It's wise to be afraid, to recognize true danger. Young ones understand that the water can sometimes be very dangerous. To really benefit from swimming, every swimmer should learn, as soon as possible, these four basic strokes; butterfly, backstroke, Breaststroke, and crawl. I feel that one of these-the breaststroke-is different from the others, since some young swimmers use this stroke naturally, without any training. In swimming there are certain rules every swimmer should follow: 1). Never swim alone! No matter how good you are in the water, don't risk drowning by swimming alone. If you swim by yourself, with no life guards or friends with you, you may get into trouble. 2). Don't go beyond your abilities. Most swimmers know enough not to swim too far from the bank or the beach, Showing off by doing dangerous tricks is no good. Swim safely and you will continue to swim and alive. 3). Don't smoke. Swimming depends on a healthy body; good lungs are part of it. 4). Work at any activity that builds muscles.	['sensible']

"A mother, who wished to encourage her son's progress in playing the piano, bought tickets for a performance by the great Polish pianist Ignace Paderewski.When the evening arrived, they found their seats near the front of the concert hall and eyed the impressive Steinway waiting on the stage.Not long after they arrived, the mother came across a friend in the hall and they began to talk with each other.Meanwhile the boy slipped away and could be found nowhere. At eight o'clock, the lights in the concert hall began to fail, and then the spotlights came on.Only then did they notice the boy who was up on the piano bench, innocently picking out ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"".Seeing this, his mother was shocked and embarrassed.But before she could bring her son back, the master appeared on the stage and quickly moved to the keyboard. He whispered gently to the boy, ""Don't quit.Keep playing."" Learning over, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began filling in the bass part.Soon his right arm reached around the other side and performed a delightful accompaniment .Together, the old master and the young boy performed so wonderfully and harmoniously on the stage and they held the attention of the crowd with their beautiful music. In all our lives, we receive helping hands from time to time--some we notice; some we don't.Equally we ourselves have countless opportunities to offer helping hands--sometimes we want our assistance to be noticed, sometimes we don't.Little of what we all achieve is without learning from others and without support from others.We are supposed to hand out what we have received."

What is true of Marc Benioff?	"For decades,the San Francisco Bay area has been the heart of the computer technology industry.Many of the biggest technology companies have their headquarters in the area called Silicon Valley.But the area has not always been associated with charity .

Money from the technology industry has also started to change the face of charity.Benjamin Soskis writes about the history and ideas behind charity in America.His articles have appeared in The Atlantic magazine and a number of major publications.He says,traditionally,donors have given after they spent much of their lives building up wealth.Usually donors are in their 70s.But an increasing number of people appearing on the list of top donors are younger than 40 years of age.Benjamin Soskis says that is something new.""There's a whole new model that's appearing in which people give and accumulate at the same time."" Some of the young donors on this year's top 50 list have started to change in the way people see charity.That is especially the case in the San Francisco area,where giving money and making money appear to be coming together.""I think it's fair to say that charity is now a part of the Silicon Valley identity."""

Canadian Red Cross staff and volunteers went to work right away and helped more than 2,100 adults and 775 children recover the basic necessities of life. It's important to share stories from volunteers to truly appreciate what they do. Christine Hoffman is a Disaster Response Volunteer in Canadian Red Cross in Saskatchewan. She's a _ Red Crosser for about 16 years. Still nothing could have prepared her for the call she took in the Recovery Center last year in response to flooding in Maple Greek. This story is best told in her own words. This is what she said: ""I will never forget the first phone call I took in the Recovery Centre. A young man called asking what services Red Cross was offering in town. As we were talking, he told me he had a rope in his backyard but he thought he would be using it for other reasons. _ I told him to come to see us so we could work together on a plan to improve his situation. He came in a little while later. Nearly two hours later he left standing straight up with tear- filled eyes. He thanked me for convincing him to come in. His home had been destroyed, but together we put together a plan and he was eventually able to move back into his own home."" During National Volunteer Week 2011, let's thank Christine, and the many other volunteers like her. Thanks for making us proud!"	['Volunteers and their amazing work']
What is the final result of the Civil Rights Movement?	The Beginning of the Civil Rights Movement In 1955,bus seats for African Americans and whites were separated in parts of the U.S.. On December 1,1955,in the city of Montgomery,Alabama,a conflict,or disagreement,started when an African American woman named Rosa Parks refused to give her bus seat to a white man and go to the back of the bus. The police took 42yearold Parks to jail. The African American community was extremely angry. They had a meeting and decided to work together to protest discrimination. They agreed to boycott the buses on the day that Parks went to court. The day was a success. Empty buses drove through the streets. The city lost money. The community decided to continue the boycott. They elected a man named Martin Luther King,Jr. to be the leader. The boycott continued. It was difficult for African Americans to get to work without buses,but they didn't stop the boycott. The city continued to lose money. Finally,the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Montgomery's bus laws were unfair and gave the African American community equal right. On December 21,1956,the bus boycott ended. The Montgomery Bus Boycott was the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. The movement eventually led to the Civil Rights Act in 1964,a set of laws that made discrimination a crime. During the Montgomery Bus Boycott,people worked together to change the government. Today,people in the U.S. continue to work together for a change. Now hundreds of organizations and community groups work to protect the rights of U.S. citizens and residents.

It is implied that controlling style of parenting may _ .	"Being Authoritative Parents Phrases like ""tiger mom"" and ''helicopter parent"" have made their way into everyday language.Many of us find ourselves drawn to the idea that with just a bit more parental hard work and effort, we might turn out children with bright futures.But is there anything wrong with a kind of ""overparenting style""? Parental involvement has a long history of being studied. Many of the studies, conducted by Diana Baumrind, a famous psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, have found that a good parent is the one who is involved and reacts to her child in a positive way, who sets high expectations but gives her child independence.These ""authoritative parents"" appear to hit the sweet spot of parental involvement and generally raise children who do better academically, psychologically and socially than children whose parents are not strict and less involved, or controlling and more involved. Why is this parenting style so successful? Authoritative parents actually help improve motivation in their children.Carol Dweck, a social psychologist at Stanford University, has done research that indicates why authoritative parents raise more motivated children.In a typical experiment, Dr.Dweck takes young children into a room and asks them to solve a simple puzzle.Most do so with little difficulty.But then Dr.Dweck tells some, but not all, of the kids how clever they are.As it turns out, the children who are not told they're smart are more motivated to solve increasingly difficult puzzles.They also show higher levels of confidence and show greater progress in puzzle-solving. As the experiment suggests, praising children's talents and abilities seems to shake their confidence.Dealing with more difficult puzzles carries the risk of losing one's status as ""smart"".Dr.Dweck's work strongly supports that of Dr.Baumrind, who also found that reasonably supporting a child's independence and limiting interference causes better academic and emotional results. The central task of growing up is to develop a sense of self that is independent and confident.If you treat your young child who is just learning to walk as if she can't walk, you reduce her confidence.Allowing children to make mistakes is one of the greatest challenges of parenting.It is easier when they are young.The potential mistakes carry greater risks, and part of being a parent is reducing risk for our children."

What can we learn about the maypole?	The first day of the month of May is known as May Day. It is the time of year when warmer weather begins. People celebrate the coming of summer with customs that are expressions of joy and hope after a long winter. Today, May Day activities have been moved to the May Day holiday on the first Monday of the month. It is a public holiday when families take advantage of the time off to visit some of the UK's many attractions, including parks, zoos, historic buildings, ancient towns and villages and beautiful countryside. May Day celebrations have their origins in the Roman festival of Flora, the goddess of fruit and flowers, which marked the beginning of summer. People would decorate their houses and villages with leaves and flowers they picked at daybreak in the belief that the vegetation spirits would bring good luck. In the very early morning, young girls went into the fields and washed their faces with dew . They believed _ made them very beautiful for the following year. May Day was an important day in the Middle Ages and was a favorite holiday of many English villages. People of the time used to cut down young trees and stick them in the ground in the village to mark the arrival of summer. This is the origin of the maypole . People danced around them in celebration of the end of winter. Maypoles were once common all over England and were kept from one year to the next. The tallest maypole is said to have been put up in London on the Strand in 1661. It stood more than 143 feet high and was cut down in 1717, when it was used by Newton to support a new reflecting telescope invented by Dutch scientist Huygens.	['It dates from the Middle Ages.']
According to the text, noise pollution may be caused by _ .	"During the last twenty years there has been increasing concern with the quality of the environment. Along with air and water pollutions, noises pollution has been recognized as a serious pollutant. As noise levels have risen, the effects of noise have become more apparent. Noise is defined as ""unwanted sound"". Causes of noise pollution include traffic, aircraft, rock bands, barking dogs, televisions, garbage trucks, and noise from neighbors, voices, alarms, and watercrafts. Studies show that over forty percent of Americans are disturbed at home or lose sleep because of noise pollution. Noise has bad effects on people and the environment. Noise causes hearing loss, interferes with human activities at home and work, and is in various ways dangerous to people's health and well being. When we think, talk, listen to music, or sleep, we need quiet. Even low levels of noise can be annoying or frustrating. Sudden increases in volume can make sounds annoying. The quieter the background is, the more _ a noise can be. Noise can also make instructions or warning unclear, resulting in accidents. Louder noise bursts can be more disruptive .Continued stress can lead to high blood pressure, which is the major cause of some diseases. Long exposure to noise levels above eight-five decibels can damage inner cells and lead to hearing loss. Noise can result in the involuntary fear response and can cause adrenaline to be pumped into the bloodstream, the heart rate to quicken, muscles to tense, breathing to increase, and the digestive system to slow down. Local government has the responsibility to fight noise pollution. For example, it can regulate the speed of trains through their community. On the other hand, a responsible citizen will never make noise pollution wherever he is."	['vehicles and animals']
Bob's new job was _ .	"Bob was a gardener and he had no work for a few months. One day he went out to look for a job. While he was walking in the street, he saw a poster at the gate of a big restaurant. It said the restaurant needed to hire a man who could grow flowers and trees well. Bob was so pleased that he went straight to answer it. There Bob was told to go back and get his old working clothes to the office. Bob did so. The boss looked over his working clothes carefully and then decided to let Bob have the job. Bob asked the boss why his working clothes were so important. The boss answered with a smile, ""Oh, young man, your working clothes are all with patches on the knees. You know, I have dismissed two men these days. They had working clothes with patches on the buttocks . They were too lazy."""	['to grow flowers and trees']
What do you think of the man? He was _ .	"A man stayed in his house as a flood engulfed his town. Two men in a boat came to his house and offered to take him to safety. ""No, thank you,"" said the man, ""God will help me."" As the waters rose, the man retreated to the second floor of his house. Now, two men in a motorboat came by and offered to rescue him. Again, the man refused, saying, ""No, thank you. God will help me. "" As the waters rose still higher, the man retreated again to the rooftop of his house. A plane came by, and someone inside it threw down a rope, urging the man to grab it and be pulled up into the airplane. Once more, the man declined and said, ""No, thank you. God will help me. "" Just then a powerful voice called out to the man, ""You idiot! I sent you a boat, a motorboat and now a plane. What more do you want me to do?"""	['very silly']
Scientists did the new study in order to know _ .	"In America, most people don't get enough sleep. Children aged 5 to 12 are advised to sleep 10 to 11 hours every night, but most of them can't sleep that long. A study found that about 41 million American workers got less than six hours of sleep every night. Scientists worry that parents are passing their bad sleeping habits down to their children. In the study, Reut Gruber and some other scientists either added or reduced on hour of sleep for healthy children aged 7 to 11. They watched the children for five nights. They wanted to know if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior. Before the study began, students were asked to sleep the same amount of hours as usual. Their teachers were asked to record their behavior. After five nights of the records, scientists found that those who slept one hour less behaved worse than those who slept one hour more. Students with less sleep were more likely to feel sad and had more problems paying attention. The scientists chose to study children in their homes instead of in a laboratory, because they wanted to find out how everyday changes might affect children's behavior at school. ""In the study, nobody became a talent, and nobody became crazy. But small changes in children can really make a big difference,"" says Gruber."	"[""if the amount of sleep can affect a child's behavior""]"
Why did the wife suggest having a dinner out?	"As my bride of many years greeted me one evening, her voice was heard through the door, ""Guess what?"" I always take a deep breath on this very leading question. ""What?"" I asked. ""I just won a sales contest at work and the prize is dinner for two at the new fancy restaurant down by the river front!"" Her excitement was inspiring. We knew the restaurant was superior because we could only understand parts of the menu. ""See? I told you there would be a place for me to wear my new spring outfit,"" she shyly reminded me. ""Two can play at that game,"" I responded. ""I will wear my gray suit, my Borsalino imported straw hat and a new silk tie. We will be dressed very well. This town will never be the same. Almost like our first date."" It was early spring and nearing dusk as the head waiter showed us to a table by a window, with a view of the river. The table was beautifully set, with a smoke-gray tablecloth decorated by bright red napkins, lemon slices in the long-stemmed water glasses, fresh flowers. A delicious meal served in such an atmosphere should be remembered a long time. As it turned out, this would probably never be forgotten. As the shadows lengthened, the riverboats rocking in the river, I murmured, ""Why don't we walk down the path like we did in Paris a few years ago? Remember the fun we had?"" Hand in hand, we walked by the stores. People smiled and nodded. Lots of smiling and nodding, in fact. ""I never realized there were so many friendly people as we have seen this evening, dear,"" I observed. ""Probably your new straw hat. Or the fact that you're such a handsome guy,"" she answered. We completed the walking tour past the store windows. After acknowledging many smiles, we found ourselves back at the restaurant, looking at our reflection in the window. It was then that I saw the reason for all the smiles. Caught in the fly of my trousers and hanging down for all to see was a bright red napkin from the restaurant!"	['Because she was given a prize for her excellent work.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"While it is common for restaurant owners to connect with their customers, a restaurant owner in the U.S. is taking it to a whole new level. Tim Harries gives out free hugs to every customer at the end of each meal. The atmosphere at his restaurant ""Tim's Place"" is so positive that customers often call it the ""World's friendliest restaurant"". ""Tim's Hug"" is in fact an item on the menu described as a ""love"" treat. Tim's hugs are doubly special because of everything he has achieved. The 26-year-old is probably the only Down syndrome sufferer in the U.S. to own a restaurant,but he has several other things to be proud of-- he's a skillful special Olympian, an excellent sailor, and all experienced fisherman. He was also chosen as Homecoming King and Student of the Year in high school! So when a man like Tim hugs you,it is sure to be a special and unforgettable experience When Tim expressed interest in opening a restaurant,Keith,a small businessman himself, supported him. Tim hired other people to manage the place and do the cooking, and he introduced the idea of free hugs. He realized that people want to feel at home at a restaurant. That is why he included ""love"" as all item on the menu. Customers can order the free hug from Tim,and even if they don't, he'll probably hug them anyway. The restaurant has been around since 2010,and Tim has given out over 19,000 hugs in the past five years -- he keeps count using a special Hug Counter.Many customers love visiting ""Tim's Place"". ""I've been coming here once a week."" said Michelle Garth-Jones, a regular customer. ""I love local restaurants, and this special one has a story that stays with you."""

The onlinguito was unknown to people in the past because _	The olinguito is new to science. Although lt has been living in the cloud forests of South Amcrica for some time. Scientists say the olinguito is the first new carnivore discovered In the Americas in more than 30 years. It is a hairy orange-brown creature with a sweet face and big eyes The animal has small. rounded ears and lives in the trees An adult weighs one kilogram and measures about 75 centimeters. with half of those centimeters taken up by its ringed tail Most of the time. it likes to eat fruit, although it also eats meat. Active at night, the animal has lived in Colombia and Ecuador for a long time. But the olinguito did not exist in science books before now. Kristofer Helgen, director at the National Museum in Washington, led the research team that confirmed the existence of the olinguito. It had been mistaken more than a century ago for a look-alike animal -- a similar but larger olingo . Mr. Helgen had been studying olingos in a museum for ten years. At that time. he observed a difference in the size and shape of the heads and teeth. That led him on an effort to prove he was looking at an animal never before described by science. He got lucky when he communicated with a zoologist in Ecuador. The animal expert there made a short video that shows an olinguito in the trees. The video confirms that the oiinguito is different from the olingo Mr. Helgen says tens of thousands of olinguitos live in the wild and are not in danger of disappearing forever. Human beings, however, are moving closer to the olinguito habitat in the Andean cloud forests. The research team estimates that 42 percent of historic olinguiio habitat has been removed	['it was mistaken for another species']
What is not talked about in the passage?	When you run, you put force that is equal to three times your body weight on your feet. The human foot contains twenty muscles. This means that there is a lot that can go wrong when you run. Most sports have some kind of running or jumping So experts at many shoe companies work hard to design good sport shoes. First, a designer enters a plan for a shoe into a computer .Engineers then improve the design. A second computer designs a model for the shoe. Then a few pairs are made. Next, the shoe is tested. Different kinds of sports shoes are made for different uses. Some are made to help marathon runners save energy during a race. Some are made for the stop-and-go kind of running tennis players. But all sport shoes have one thing in common: they are designed to help people's feet comfortable during sports. Today, nearly every sport has its own special shoe designed for just the kind of running that sport needs.	['The materials of sport shoes.']
If you want to have more chances for making friends, you should _ .	"It's hard to make friends if you stay at home alone all the time. Get out of house and do things that will put you in touch with other people. It's easier to make friends when you have similar interests. Don't be afraid to show people what you're really good at. Talk about things you like and do best. People will be interested in you if there is something interesting about you. Look at people in the eyes when you talk to them. That way , they'll find it easier to talk to you. Be a good listener. Let people talk about themselves before talking about ""me ,me, me"" Try to make friends with the kinds of people you really like, respect and admire ,not just with those who we are easy to meet. Be friends with a lot of people .That way ,you 'll have a bigger group of people to choose and have more chances for making friends."	['try to make friends with the kinds of people you really like, respect and admire.']
The first Winter Olympic were held in_.	"The history of the Winter Games, however, has been even more troubled than that of the Summer Games. Until 1924 all the winter sports competitions, held every four years from 1901 to 1917 and again in 1922, had been in the Scandinavian countries - Sweden, Norway and Finland. The sportsmen of these countries believed that the Winter Games could only be held in the Scandinavian way. Coubertin, himself, was against a separate Winter Olympics as he felt that they would cause trouble within the Olympic movement. However, as winter holidays in the Alps became more and more popular, so did the idea of a truly international Winter Games. The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix in 1924, though they were only recognized by the International Olympic Committee as ""Olympic"" two years later in 1926. Although there were many arguments before them, the first Games were a success, but the problems did not end there. In 1935, it was decided by the IOC that ski teachers could not compete in the Olympics because they were professionals. This caused a big argument between the IOC and the International Ski Federation, who agreed with the ski teachers. However, war came and with it an end to the discussions. When the war was finally over, the Winter Games were started up again, as before, in St Moritz in 1948 and the crisis had passed."	['1924']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month. Film ticket circulation service on cell phone, also called the ""Green channel of film tickets ordering"", is aiming at lowing the cost of ticket circulation and easing the ticket distribution pressure on such popular film-watching days as summer and winter vacations or Valentine's Day. ""People log onto the net through cell phones, then choose cinema seats, _ , browse information for new films and read cinema introductions,"" said Guan Zheng, the publicity chief of Xingmei Digital Media Company Ltd., the service provider. ""Film fans can enjoy various discount prices if they order tickets via cell phones,"" Guan said. Meanwhile, the cell phone ticket circulation platform provides subscribers general mobile phone services like jokes, videos, flashes, phone ring downloads and games. The service is about to be put into trial at the Beijing-based Xingmei International Cinema for a month before being putting into use at other cinema chains both in and outside Beijing, as the service is going to be improved through gradual expansion, said Guan. China's film industry that is being restored has seen more and more enthusiastic moviegoers. Up to the end of 2009, China has had more than 5,000 specialized cinemas, among which there are 2,243 modern cinemas with 3, 668 silver screens and 56 cinema chains. Currently, many people buy film tickets on the Internet or by phoning the cinema's ticket office or simply queuing at the cinema gate. More people want to buy tickets on popular days like May Day holiday, National Day holiday or Valentine's Day. Yet the inefficient ticket circulation system contributes the most to the failure."	['The price of the ticket ordered via cell phone will be lower.']
Mr. Patrick was thought by the author to _	"Mr. Patrick was new to the school and to us. Even though he was a great teacher, he seemed rather like a character out of a horror movie. He didn't look that bad, but somehow, he looked extremely scary to me. Some kids began to believe that he was a murderer or a ghost; some believed he was mad and a few believed that he might have suffered a lot in his life. I was one of those 'few'. One day I gathered up my courage and headed towards the school garden. He was, as usual, sitting on a bench alone. I breathed heavily a few times and then walked towards him. ""How are you?"" I asked with my voice crackling. He managed to say, ""Fine."" ""Well, good to know,"" I tried to be happy. ""Hmmm..."" was all I heard. ""What's up with you?"" then seeing a puzzled look on his face, I tried to be more formal and respectful. ""I mean, why aren't you like all other people in the school? Why are you always so quiet and sad? Why..."" ""No dear, some things are better left unsaid,"" he said gloomily. ""Oh no sir, nothing is better left unsaid. If you want to share your feelings with me and reduce the pain of your heart, you are free to do so. I promise I will never ever tell anyone."" ""With you? You are just a little girl; what will you understand?"" I was somehow offended but still I managed to persuade him, ""So what, Sir? You see, if you tell me your problem, you will have a light heart and you will have the feeling that someone somewhere cares about you."" ""Oh okay, that was a very nice belief indeed; let's take a walk and I will let you know everything."" Soon after our little talk, there was a visible change on his face. Later that day in the class, there was a smile on his face."	['have suffered a lot']
If the trousers were 197 inches at first, how long were they at last?	"A young man once went to town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went to his room and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long. He went into the kitchen, and his mother and two sisters were doing some washing there. He said to them, ""The new trousers are too long. They need cutting by two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me?"" His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything. But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went to her son's room silently and cut the trousers by two inches. She came back without saying anything to her daughters. After supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She went to his room and cut the trousers by two inches without saying anything to anyone. The younger sister went to the cinema. But when she came back, she also remembered her brother's trousers. So she went to his room and cut them by two inches, too."	['191 inches']
What did the author decide to do with the room at last?	"I decided a few months ago that l was going to treat myself to a 4-day getaway from Los Angeles and visit Chicago. I turned in some long-saved frequent flier miles for the airplane ticket, but had to shell out cash I really couldn't afford for the hotel. I found a travel website where a discounted promotional 3-night stay was purchased from a recently opened hotel. About three weeks before the trip, I had to regretfully cancel and only then realized the room, while transferable to another person, couldn't be changed to a later date and wasn't refundable .For the next two weeks, I tried selling it on Craig's list with no success. Five days before the ""big weekend"" I gave up trying to spend any money and decided I'd contact some friends who live in Chicago and offer someone a free ""staycation"". After trying a handful of people all of whom already had their own plans, I was determined to have the room not go to waste. That's when it suddenly occurred to me that I was looking at the rooms in the wrong way. Instead of viewing them for vacation purposes, surely there must be a way to put them to good use, and that was when the idea that some sort of shelter might be able to use it hit me. I finally found one whose focus is aiding victims of domestic violence. This particular one was willing to listen to my out-of-left-field story and facilitated the transfer of the rooms. The shelter was working with a desperate woman and her young daughter, who were fortunately able to make use of the room."	['Use it to help strangers in need.']
From the news we can learn that _ .	"Pan Aiying, a Chinese teacher at Wutou Middle School in Qihe County, in East China's Shandong Province, didn't think her text messages would help to get her belongings back. A young man riding a motorcycle robbed her of her bag, in which there was her mobile phone, bank cards and 4,900 yuan, as she was riding her bicycle home on Saturday evening. Pan said at first she considered calling the police, but then decided to try to persuade the young man to return her bag. Pan called her lost phone with her friend's, but couldn't get through. So she began sending messages. ""Hey, I'm Pan Aiying, a teacher from Wutou Middle School. You must be going through a difficult time. If so, I will not blame you. "" Wrote Pan in her first text message, which got no answer. ""Keep the 4,900 yuan if you really need it, but please return the other things to me. You are still young. To make mistakes is human. Correcting your mistake is more important than anything. "" Pan wrote in another message. She gave up hope after sending 21 text messages without any answer and planned to call the police the next morning. However, as she left her home on Sunday morning, Pan found her stolen bag lying in the courtyard. Nothing was lost. ""Dear Pan: I am sorry. I made a mistake. Please forgive me. You are so kind even though I stole from you. I'll correct my ways and be an honest person,"" said a letter left with the bag."	['the young man would not steal any more']
When did the author realize that she was too short?	"I was shopping in the supermarket when I heard a young voice. ""Mom, come here! There's a lady here my size!"" The mother rushed to her son; then she turned to me to apologize. I smiled and told her, ""It's okay."" Then talked to the boy, ""Hi, I'm Darry Kramer. How are you?"" He studied me from head to toe, and asked, ""Are you a little mommy?"" ""Yes, I have a son,"" I answered. ""Why are you so little?"" he asked. ""It's the way I was born,"" I said. ""Some people are little. Some are tall. I'm just not going to grow any bigger."" After I answered his other questions, I shook the boy's hand and left. My life as a little person is filled with stories like that. I enjoy talking to children and explaining why I look different from their parents. It takes only one glance to see my uniqueness. I stand three feet nine inches tall. I was born an achondroplasia dwarf . Despite this, I did all the things other kids did when I was growing up. I didn't realize how short I was until I started school. Some kids joked on me, calling me names. Then I knew. I began to hate the first day of school each year. New students would always stare at me as I struggled to climb the school bus stairs. But I learned to smile and accept the fact that I was going to be noticed my whole life. I decided to make my uniqueness an advantage rather than a disadvantage. What I lacked in height, I made up for in personality. I'm 47 now, and the stares have not _ as I've grown older. People are amazed when they see me driving. I try to keep a good attitude. When people are rude, I remind myself, ""Look what else I have--a great family, nice friends."" It's the children's questions that make my life special. I enjoy answering their questions. My hope is that I will encourage them to accept their peers (a person of the same age, class, position, etc.), whatever size and shape they come in, and treat them with respect."

.	"In the United States, friendships can be close, constant, intense, generous, and real, yet fade away in a short time if things change. Neither side feels hurt by this. Both may exchange Christmas greeting for a year or two, perhaps a few letters for a while--then no more. If the same two people meet again by chance, even years later, they pick up the friendship where it's left off and are delighted. In the States, you can feel free to visit people's homes and share their holidays without fear that you are taking on a lasting obligation. Do not hesitate to accept hospitality because you cannot give it in return. No one will expect you to do so for they know you are far from home. Americans will enjoy welcoming you and be pleased if you accept their hospitality easily. Once you arrive there, the welcome will be full and warm and real. Most visitors find themselves easily invited into many homes there. In some countries it is considered inhospitable to entertain at home, offering what is felt as ""merely"" home cooked food, not ""doing something"" for your guest. It is felt that restaurant entertaining shows more respect and welcome. Or for various other reasons, such as crowded space, language difficulties, or family custom, outsiders are not invited into homes. In the United States, both methods are used, but it is often considered more friendly to invite a person to one's home than to go to a public place, except in pure business relationships. So, if your host or hostess brings you home, do not feel that you are being shown inferior treatment."	['naughty children']

It is a British film that a baby is kidnapped by an old woman, but the faithful family dog Rover saves the baby at last. Though Rover is a common name, it became popular because of the dog hero in the movie. Lassie: lassie used to be the most famous dog in the world. She is a character who has starred in many movies, TV shows and books over the years. Lassie was created by Eric Knight and made her way into a short story in a newspaper in 1913 and into a novel in 1940. Laika: Laika is the first animal that has orbited the earth. On November 3, 1957, Laika was sent to space in the Soviet Union's Sputnik 2.(2). The Soviets admitted soon after the launch that the spacecraft would not return. It meant that the poor animal would die. People argued a lot about Laika's death. Several countries issued stamps in memory of Laika. She became the first animal to give her life for the exploration of space. Rin Tin Tin: Rin Tin Tin is the first American dog movie star. He first appeared in WhereThe North Begins in 1925. Rin Tin Tin went on to make 25 movies, he even signed his own contracts with paw prints . During his best time, he earned about 5 million dollars for those people who worked for him.

Snoopy appeared in the Peanuts comic strips until Schultz's retirement ( and death ) in February of 2000.	['Laika.']
Horlton was _ .	Dear sir, I read your story (of the 4thFebruary) about the cost of living in the country rather than in the town, and I agree with most of your opinions.My husband and I lived in the middle of Horlton until two years ago a seaside town of nearly five hundred thousand people.When my husband stopped working, we moved to our present house in a small village at the foot of Roland Hill, and there is no doubt that our costs are higher now. I have to do my shopping in small shops, where the food is more expensive than in city supermarkets; it costs more to travel by bus; and because the men who come to mend the television or the washing-machine, have to come further, we have to pay them more. But it does not cost us much to enjoy what is beautiful in the country; and peace and quiet are cheap.It takes many people a lot of time and money to drive into the country to enjoy the simple things of life; yet we can enjoy them just by going out of the front door.It costs more to live here than it did in Horlton, but now life really is worth living. Yours faithfully, Edith Randall (Mrs)	['a town of nearly 500,000 people']

The passage suggests that Stellar Sea Lions usually breed and give birth _ .	"Located in Florence, Oregon is ""Sea Lion Caves"", the only known western, coastal, mainland habitat of Stellar Sea Lions. It is also the world's largest sea cave in existence today and a perfect place to get up close and personal with nature. The sea caves are said to be the home of an estimated 200 sea lions and that at any given time visitors can expect to see at least 150 sea lions going about their daily business. The most immense of all sea lions, the Stellar males are known to grow up to 12 feet in length and weight an incredulous 1,500 pounds. The females, on the other hand, tend to be a bit smaller and average 9 feet in length with an average weight of 700 pounds. They tend to breed and give birth during the spring and summer months. The breeding and birthing process takes place on the steep cliff ledges that surround the sea cave. Therefore the best time to view this ritual is during those select months from the outside viewing platform. In addition to the sea lions, visitors can expect to catch a glimpse of the rare Pigeon Guillemont. These unusual sea birds tend to nest in seaweed along the cliff ledges in early April. And ever the graceful Gray Whales are expected to be seen. Each year, travelling in pods, these sea creatures _ around "" Cape Blance"" on their way to and from their native Alaska waters. As of 2010 "" Sea Lion Caves"" is open daily year round except for both Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. The ticket box office is open from 9:00 am until 5:30 pm. Visitor have a choice of two different ticket options; platform view or cave view. And admission into the cave itself is $13.00 for adults and $ 8.00 for children ages 3 to 12. Children under the age of 2 are admitted for free and there is a discount ticket price available for senior citizens . It currently costs $3.50 per person to access the topside wildlife viewing platform. While on the platform visitor can pay an additional fee to use the on-site telescope or opt to bring their own such equipment."	['in the warmer season months']

What does the previous study have in common with the new one?	"Eating at a slow speed may help reduce hunger, the U.S. researchers said on Monday. Previous research suggests that the ability to control energy intake may be affected by the speed at which we eat, and a high eating rate may damage the relationship between the sensory signals and processes that control how much we eat. In order to learn more about the link between eating speed and energy intake, researchers examined how eating speed affects calories consumed during a meal in both normal-weight subjects as well as overweight or obese subjects. In the new study, a group of normal-weight subjects and a group of overweight or obese subjects were asked to consume two meals in a controlled environment. All subjects ate one meal slowly, took small bites, chewed thoroughly, and paused and put the spoon down between bites, and ate a second meal quickly, took large bites, chewed quickly, and did not pause and put the spoon down. At the conclusion of the study, the researchers found only normal-weight subjects had a statistically significant reduction in caloric consumption by eating slowly. ""A lack of statistical significance in the overweight and obese group may be partly due to the fact that they consumed less food during both eating conditions compared to the normal-weight subjects,"" Professor Meena Shah said, ""it is possible that the overweight and obese subjects felt more self-conscious, and thus ate less during the study."" Despite the differences in caloric consumption between the normal-weight and overweight and obese subjects, the study found some similarities. Both groups felt less hungry later on after the slow meal than after the fast meal, which indicates that greater hunger suppression among both groups could be expected from a meal consumed more slowly. Also, both the normal-weight and overweight or obese groups consumed more water during the slow meal. ""The higher water intake during the slow eating condition may have affected food consumption,"" said Shah. According to Shah, slowing the speed of eating may help suppress hunger levels and ""may even improve the enjoyment of a meal"". The findings were published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."	['There is a link between eating speed and energy intake.']
What could the computer do?	"A well-known manufacturer of weighing machines produced a new model. The machine had a computer inside it, and this computer could do wonderful things: it could weigh people very accurately; it could tell them their weight in their own language; and it could tell them what they should eat to reduce their weight. The manufacturer decided to try out his machine before he sold it to the shops. He looked around for a good place to put it and finally decided on an airport. There were always people at an airport from many different countries. The first person to use the machine was an Italian woman. She stood on the machine, put a coin in and waited to hear her weight. The machine took only a second or two to weigh her, decide on her nationality and the language she spoke, and figure out what kind of food she should eat. ""Good morning, madam,"" it said in perfect Italian. ""Your weight is 72 kilos, three more than it should be for a woman of your height, age and nationality. This is because you have been eating too much spaghetti. I suggest you eat more fruit and vegetables. Please have a nice day"". The second person to use the machine was a Chinese girl. She stood on the machine, put a coin in and waited to hear her weight. ""Good morning, Miss,"" the machine said in perfect Chinese. ""Your weight is 38 kilos, exactly the correct weight for your height, age and nationality. Continue to eat what you are eating. Please have a nice day."" The third person to use the machine was a huge Australian woman. She walked up to the machine and looked at it for a long time. At last she found the courage to stand on the machine and put a coin in. The machine spoke immediately. ""Good morning. Will one of you ladies please get off?"""	['Weigh and talk to people.']
Many American kids like to collect _ .	"BASEBALL. It's just a word, but for millions of Americans it brings much more than a word. Hot dogs. Cold beers. Sunny afternoons. Baseball is the game of fathers and sons. Fathers and sons catch with each other on lawns in the US. A father's favorite team becomes his son's. Grandfathers talk to their grandsons about games played long ago. Many American kids collect baseball cards. The cards have pictures of their favorite players on them. In school, friends trade baseball cards just like they trade their lunches. Players are known as ""the boys of summer"" because people often play the sport mostly in warm months. You don't need to be of a certain size or shape to play baseball. You don't have to be tall like a basketball player or strong like an American footballer. You just need to want to have fun. Baseball is not as fast-paced a game as basketball. But when you go to see a game, there's time to relax, talk and get to know other people. Baseball may not be the most popular sport in the US, but it is the most traditional. It's not just a game any more, but an important part of American culture, like apple pie and grandma's house."

The passage is mainly for those _ .	"It has always been thought that alcohol causes people to put on weight because it contains a lot of sugar, but new research suggests glass a day could form part a diet. Looking at past studies they found that, while heavy drinkers do put on weight; those who drink _ can actually lose weight. A spokesman for the research team at Navarro University in Spain says, ""Light to moderate alcohol intake, especially of wine, may be more likely to protect against, rather than promote, weight gain."" The International Scientific Forum on Alcohol research reviewed the findings and agreed with most of the conclusions, particularly that data do not clearly indicate if moderate drinking increases weight. Boston University's Dr. Harvey Finkel found that the biologic mechanisms relating alcohol to changes in body weight are not properly understood. His team pointed out the strong protective effects of moderate drinking on the risk of getting conditions like diabetes , which relate to increasing obesity. Some studies suggest that even very obese people may be at lower risk of diabetes if they are moderate drinkers. The group says alcohol provides calories that are quickly absorbed into the body and a enot stored in fat, and that this process could explain the differences in its effects from those of other foods. They agree that future research should be directed towards assessing the roles of different types of alcoholic drinks, taking into consideration drinking patterns and including the past tendency of participants to gain weight. For now there is little evidence that consuming small to moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis increases one's risk of becoming obese. What's more, a study three years ago suggested that resveratrol, a compound present in grapes and red wine destroys fat cells."	['who have a drinking habit']
What did the author think of the woman's behavior?	"One day I was driving home with a woman. She rolled down the window, fifty feet away from the driveway and spit her gum out of the window. ""Couldn't you just wait five seconds and put your gum where it belongs?"" I asked, annoyed. She was not the only one who was gum-lazy. Consider the following. Every time I brush chewed gum under my desk, I shake with fright. At Folsom Middle School, whenever I had to walk by the gum wall next to the girls' locker room, I felt totally disgusted. When I was young, I walked outside during my dance show in my ballet shoes, always stepping right on a big and juicy piece of bubble gum. I was extremely upset. The worst part of all these incidents is that a trash can is located near. But some people are too lazy to walk towards it. If you can't be a responsible gum chewer, don't chew at all. That's all I'm going to say. Take Singapore as a good example. The chewing gum ban in Singapore was placed. It bans the import and sale of chewing gum in Singapore, whether for the purpose of trade or personal chewing. However, the ban has been partly lifted with some types of gum, such as medical gum, allowable. This comes with the warning that it is sold only by a druggist, who has to take down the names of buyers. Obviously, the Singapore government gets angry at gum stuck in keyholes of mailboxes and on elevator buttons. Not only is it annoying, but chewing gum can actually do harm to the health. Most gum contains aspartame , a chemical sweetener that the US government is now deciding whether or not it is a deadly chemical. If it is, it may cause cancer. Other studies suggest that aspartame may cause neurological disorders. Therefore, aspartame is not allowed to use in the US. So just say no to chewing gum."	['It was unacceptable.']

He spent much of his life time studying the diseases of cattle, chickens and other tame animals. His wife learned to help him with his work. Almost everyone knows that Pasteur is the man responsible for finding a way of preventing milk from spoiling . Not many people know he was the first to imagine and to prove that air we breathe is full of germs . One of his greatest successes was finding a treatment for people and animals to prevent a disease called rabies . Louis Pasteur won many honors and could have got large amount of money. But Pasteur preferred to live simply. The real happiness of this unusual man came from his work. Louis Pasteur did so well in his life that the French government took up his work and created the Institute Pasteur in the year 1888.	['work']
How do you feel during the first stage of culture shock?	"We may know that there are four basic stages that human beings pass through when they enter and live in a new culture. This process, which helps us to deal with culture shock , is the way our head and our personality react to(...) the strange new things we meet with when we move from one culture to another. Culture begins with the ""honeymoon stage"". This is the time when we first arrive in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting. We see new things, hear new sounds and language, eat new kinds of food. This stage can last for quite a long time because we feel we are very excited. Unluckily, the second stage can be more difficult. After we have got used to our new life, we can become very tired and begin to miss our homeland and our family, friends, pets. All the little problems in life seem to be much bigger and more disturbing when you face them in a foreign culture. This time of cultural adjustment can be very difficult and lead to pulling away from the new culture. The third stage is called the ""adjustment stage"". This is when you begin to realize that things are not so bad in the host culture. Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize that you are becoming stronger by learning to take care of yourself in the new place. Things are still difficult, but you are now a survivor! The fourth stage can be called ""at ease at last"". Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place. You can deal with most problems that you have. You may still have problems with the language, but you know you are strong enough to deal with them. There is a fifth stage of culture shock which many people don't know about. This is called ""reverse culture shock"". Surprisingly, this happens when you go back to your own culture and find that you have changed and that things there have changed while you have been away. Now you feel a little uncomfortable back home. Life is a struggle!"	['Happy and excited.']
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"There was great excitement on the planet of Venus . Venusian scientists managed to land a satellite on the planet Earth, and it has been sending back signals as well as photographs ever since. The satellite was directed into an area known as Manhattan, named after the great Venusian astronomer Professor. Manhattan, who first discovered it with his telescope 20000 light years ago. Because of excellent weather conditions and extremely strong signals, Venusian scientists were able to get valuable information as to feasibility of a manned flying saucer landing on Earth. A press conference was held at the Venus Institute of Technology. ""We have come to the conclusion, based on last week's satellite landing,"" Prof. Zog said, ""that there is no life on Earth."" ""How do you know this?"" the science reporter of the Venus Evening Star asked. ""For one thing, Earth's surface in the area of Manhattan is made up of solid concrete and nothing can grow there. For another, the atmosphere is filled with carbon monoxide and other deadly gases and nobody could possibly breathe this air and survive."" ""What does this mean as far as our flying saucer program is concerned?"" ""We shall have to take our own oxygen with us, which means a much heavier flying saucer than originally planned."" ""Are there any other dangers that you discovered in your studies?"" ""Take a look at this photo. You see this dark black cloud hovering over the surface of Earth? We don't know what it is made of, but it could give us a lot of trouble and we shall have further tests before we send a Venus Being there."" ""Over here you will notice what seems to be a river, but the satellite findings indicates it is polluted and the water is unfit to drink. This means we shall have to carry our own water, which will add even greater weight to the saucer."" ""If all you say is true, won't this set back the flying saucer program several years?"" ""Yes, but we shall continue as soon as the Grubstart gives us the added funds ."" Profession. Zog replied."	['pollution on Earth makes it impossible for Venusians to survive there']

What is the writer worrying about?	If prefix = st1 /U.S.software companies don't pay more attention to quality, they could kiss their business good-bye. BothIndiaandBrazilare developing a world-class software industry. Their weapon is quality and one of their jobs is to attract the topU.S.quality specialists whose voices are not listened to in their country. Already, of the world's 12 software houses that have earned the highest rating in the world, seven are in India. That's largely because they have used new methods rejected by American software specialists. For example, for decades, quality specialists, W. Edwards Deming and J. M. Juran had urgedU.S.software companies to change their attitudes to quality. But their quality call mainly fell on deaf ears in the U.S -- but not in Japan. By the 1970s and 1980s,Japanwas grabbing market share with better, cheaper products. They used Deming's and Juran's ideas to bring down the cost of good quality to as little as 5% of total production costs. InU.S.factories, the cost of quality then was 10 times as high: 50%. In software, it still is. Watts S. Humphrey spent 27 years at IBM heading up software production and then quality assurance. But his advice was seldom paid attention to. He retired from IBM in 1986. In 1987, he worked out a system for assessing(evaluating) and improving software quality. It has proved its value time and again. For example, in 1990 the cost of quality at Raytheon Electronics Systems was almost 60% of total software production costs. It fell to 15% in 1996 and has since further dropped to below 10%. Like Deming and Juran, Humphrey seems to be winning more praises overseas than at home. The Indian government and several companies have just founded the Watts Humphrey Software Quality Institute at the Software Technology Park in Chennai,India. Let's hope thatU.S.lead in software will not be eaten up by its quality problems.	['The US will no longer be the first software player in the world.']

The author's purpose in writing the text is to _ .	Although in the 17th century in the United States fine art and folk art had similar qualities, a difference between them began to appear as time went on in the 18th and 19th centuries artists with ambition studied abroad and came back to paint portraits of upper-class families in American society. The less ambitious or less fortunate artists traveled around their own areas and created pictures of countryside society. Anyway, artists got trained and those simple creations improved a lot. Around 1930,folk art began to take on a new meaning and was considered as an expression of a small cultural class. Folk art is never the product of art movements, but comes out of craft traditions. This art is based not on measurements or calculations and rarely goes with the standards of realism. It goes straight to the bases of art which the folk artists feel naturally. The period 1930~ 1960 was the time when folk artists began to receive recognition. They often began their art careers late in life and used art as an outlet for their energy. Their materials were cheap and simple, their subjects were different, but their creativity flowed. Doing their own things became the norm , and was what made folk art so desirable. Although it is hard to define folk art, one thing is certain --- it touches us in a special way because the artists show us how he or she brought beauty into their everyday life. Since folk artists come from all walks of life, each piece of art created is one of a kind, emphasizing color, simplicity of line and brave, simple form. Most importantly, it exemplifies(...) the history of American life.	['explain the history and characteristics of folk art in America']
What actually inspired Phil White to overcome all the difficulties?	Phil White has just returned from an 18,000-mile, around-the-world bicycle trip.White had two reasons for making this _ journey.First of all, he wanted to use the trip to raise money for charity, which he did.He raised PS70,000 for the British charity, Oxfam.White's second reason for making the trip was to break the world record and become the fastest person to cycle around the world.He is still waiting to find out if he has broken the record or not. White set off from Trafalgar Square, in London, on 19th June 2004 and was back 299 days later.He spent more than l,300 hours in the saddle and destroyed four sets of tyres and three bike chains.He had the adventure of his life crossing Europe, the Middle East, India, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Americas.Amazingly, he did all of this with absolutely no support team.No jeep carrying food, water and medicine.No doctor.Nothing! Just a bike and a very, very long road. The journey was lonely and desperate at times.He also had to fight his way across deserts, through jungles and over mountains.He cycled through heavy rains and temperatures of up to 45 degrees, all to help people in need.There were other dangers along the road.In Iran, he was chased by armed robbers and was lucky to escape with his life and the little money he had.The worst thing that happened to him was having to cycle into a headwind on a road that crosses the south of Australia.For l,000 kilometres he battled against the wind that was constantly pushing him.This part of the trip was slow, hard work and depressing, but he made it in the end.Now Mr.White is back and intends to write a book about his adventures.

What is the main problem of the lunches in schools according to the military officers?	"WASHINGTON-School lunches have been called many things, but a group of retired military officers is giving them a new label: national security threat. That's not a reference to the mystery meat served up in the cafeteria line either. The retired officers are saying that school lunches have helped make the nation's young people so fat that fewer of them can meet the military's physical fitness standards, and recruitment will be difficult. A new report being released Tuesday says more than 9 million young adults, or 27 percent of all Americans ages 17 to 24, are too overweight to join the military. Now, the officers are advocating for passage of a wideranging nutrition bill that aims to make the nation's school lunches healthier. The military group acknowledges that other things keep young adults out of the armed services, such as a criminal record or the lack of a high school diploma. But weight problems that have worsened over the past 15 years are now the leading medical reason that recruits are rejected. Although all branches of the military now meet or exceed recruitment goals, retired Navy Rear Adm. James Barnett Jr., a member of the officers group, says the _ trend could affect that. ""When over a quarter of young adults are too fat to fight, we need to take notice,"" Barnett said. He noted that national security in the year 2030 is ""absolutely dependent"" on reversing child obesity rates. This isn't the first time the military has gotten involved in the debate over school lunches. During World War II, military leaders had the opposite problem, reporting that many recruits were rejected because of stunted growth and inadequate nutrition. After the war, military leaders pushed Congress to establish the national school lunch program so children would grow up healthier. Today, the group is urging Congress to eliminate junk food and highcalorie beverages from schools, put more money into the school lunch program and develop new strategies that help children develop healthier habits."

Which of the following best describes the authour's biking experience?	"China is a land of bicycles.At least it was back in 1992 when I travelled the country.Back then everyone seemed to be riding a bicycle.Millions of them,all black.Cars were rare.Yet since my arrival in Beijing last year,I've found the opposite is true.There were millions of cars.However,people still use their bicycles to get around.For many,it's the easiest and cheappiest way to travel today. Bicycles also come in different colours---silver,green,red,blue,yellow,whatever you want. It's fun watching people biking. They rush quickly through crossroads,move skillfully through traffic,and ride even on sidewalks . Bicycles allow people the freedom to move about that cars just can't provide. Eager to be part of this aspect of Chinese culture, I decided to buy a bicycle. Great weather accompanied my great buy. I immediately jumped up on my bicycle seat and started to ride. My first ride home was orderly .To be safe,I stayed with a ""pack""of bikers while cars on the streets came running swiftly out of nowhere at times. I didn't want to get hit.So I took the ride carefully. Crossing the streets was the biggest problem. It was a lot like crossing a major highway back in the United States. The streets here were wide,so crossing took time,skill and a little bit of luck. I finally made it home. The feeling on the bicycle was amazing. The air hitting my face and going through my air was wonderful. I was sitting on top of the world as I passed by places and people.Biking made me feel alive."

From the passage, we can guess _ .	The journey to the moon had been the first step toward future exploration in space. The distance between the Moon and Earth is very short indeed when compared with the distances between Earth and the other planets. Mars, the nearest planet to Earth is millions of miles away. Traveling to the planets will be man's next aim. Such travels will be more challenging than the trip to the moon and certainly more adventurous. Recently, two American spaceships, Vikings 1 and 2, landed on Mars trying to discover whether that planet has any life on it. So far the signs of life on Mars has neither confirmed nor ruled out. Russians have discovered that the surface of Venus is so hot that it is almost certain that there is no life there. Also the atmosphere of Venus is extremely dense and the pressure is nearly a hundred times greater than that of the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists believe man may find planets which have the same conditions as those we have on Earth , but man should realize Earth will be his only home for a long time and begin to love and care for it.

Professor Michel Claes believes that Canada,France and Italy _ .	"Researchers from France and Italy discovered that Canadian parents are less strict with their children than mothers and fathers in France and Italy. ""Our most important finding was the difference between Canadians and the others,"" said Professor Michel Claes,the lead author of the study.""Canadians focus on independence and negotiation.On the other hand,Italians,for example,exercise more control.We found Canadians seem to focus on negotiation in case of a conflict."" Claes said Canada,France and Italy were selected for the study because they share important cultural and social factors.""We chose FrenchCanadians because they share the same language as France,and originally came from France and share certain values.Italy was included because it was considered to have similar,strong and important family values,"" he explained. The researchers examined the emotional ties between parents and their children by questioning 1,256 students aged 11 to 19 years old. Canadian students reported less control and more free actions,according to the study.Italian parents were stricter and French parents were somewhere in the middle. Claes explains that the differences lie in education in Canada,France and Italy. ""North America has its own educational values,which promote individualization.Tolerance and comprehension are encouraged.Italy,on the other hand,promotes respect of authority,control,and the need for permission."" he said. Children from all three countries described their mothers as warm and communicative.Italian and Canadian children had similar feelings about their fathers,and reported high levels of emotional ties.But French fathers were generally thought by their children to be more distant and cold. ""We were surprised by this,"" Claes admitted.""It seems as though the relationships between French mothers and their children were becoming closer over time,while fathers maintain a form of distance and coldness,which is more of a source of conflict in France than in the other countries."""

"By saying ""My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water"" (Para 2), von Wiesenberg wants to convey the message that _ ."	"Reading new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. ""My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water."" He says. But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York's municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive. Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water. As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate over the profits. A restaurant's typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it's often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren't available in stores, most dines don't notice or care. As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it. Regardless of how it's sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity."

Why was a new rule made?	"Climbing Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, just became more challenging. The government of Nepal is telling climbers they cannot leave rubbish on the trails . Each climber will have to come down the mountain with at least 18 pounds of garbage. That's the average amount of rubbish a climber leaves behind on Everest. Officials say climbers are responsible for their own rubbish. ""We are not asking climbers to pick up rubbish left by someone else,"" said Maddhu Sudan Burlakoti, who works for the Nepal Tourism Ministry. ""We just want them to bring back what they took up."" More than 4,000 people have reached the 29,035-foot mountain top in the past 60 years. Leaving rubbish along the way helps climbers keep their bags light so they have energy to reach the top. ""The rubbish problem in Mount Everest is not new,"" Burlakoti says. ""When the people started to climb the mountain, they started to leave their garbage there."" They have left behind cans, tents, food wrappers, and equipment. Last year, climbers carried down a total of four tons of rubbish. The new rule came into effect in April of 2014. To make sure it is followed, climbers will have to deposit money before the climb. Once they climb back down the mountain, officials will check climbers at a return camp to make sure they have the required 18 pounds of rubbish. If they do, their money will be returned to them. If they do not, climbers will not receive their deposit and they will not be given a permit the next time they want to climb Everest. The goal is to make sure no more litter will be left on Everest, which has earned the nickname the World's Highest Dustbin. ""As we offer Mount Everest to all the people of the world they should take responsibility to clean it,"" Burlakoti says, ""After seeing the results from this, we will extend this rule to other mountains also."""	['Mount Everest was considered to be a big dustbin.']
Why was the big tree proud before its neighbor?	"A big, mighty tree stood in a forest. Its branches spread out and its roots went deep in the earth. A lot of people came here to have a rest under it. And a lot of birds stood on its branches to sing and dance. The big tree was very proud all the time. At the foot of the tree, there was a little plant. The plant was thin, and seemed to be blown down by any of a little wind. One day, the two neighbors were having a little chat. ""Well, little one,"" said the tree to the plant, ""why not put your feet deeply in the earth, and raise your head high in the air as I do?"" ""I see there is no need to do so,"" said the plant with a smile. ""In fact, I think I may be safer in this way."" ""Safer?"" said the tree. ""Are you safer than I am? Do you know how deep my roots are in the earth and how strong my branches are? Who can possibly pull me out by the roots or bow my head to the ground?"" And the tree didn't want to say anything to the weak plant. But the tree was to regret its words very soon. One evening, a great hurricane came. It blew the trees off their roots and almost destroyed the forest completely. It uprooted(......)the mighty tree and blew it away with great force. When the storm had gone, the villagers living nearby came to check the damage. The mighty tree lay on the ground, but the little plant still stood there."	['All of the above.']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"Residents along Australia's east coast awoke in the morning to an orange sky as winds swept millions of tons of red dust from the country's inland and dumped it on Sydney. Tanya Ferguson,living in Sydney,saw that the room was completely orange.She thought there was a bush fire.But when she went outside,the entire city was covered in a film of orange dust. ""It was like being in the outback ,but it was right here in the city,""she said On that day,a big dust storm swept through Sydney.It covered the city in orange dust for about eight hours,making landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Harbor Bridge invisible. The storm affected the transportation system.Flights were delayed.Roads were busy as drivers struggled in the difficult conditions.Children and the elderly were told to stay indoors until the dust had cleared.Later strong winds blew it out to the sea and up the coast. No one was hurt in the storm,though health officials answered hundreds of calls from people with breathing difficulties.Emergency services responded to hundreds of calls about tree branches brought down by strong winds. Dust storms are common in the Australian outback,where the land is arid .But the storms rarely reach the coastal regions. Officials said it was the worst dust storm of the past 70 years.Air pollution levels were 15,500 micrograms of pollutants per cubic meter. ""On a clear day the pollutants are around 10--20 micrograms per cubic meter,""said Chris Eiser of the NSW department of the environment. Experts said that dry conditions in the outback and strong winds caused the sandstorm. ""Ten very dry years over inland southern Australia and very strong winds have combined to produce the storm,""said Nigel Tapper,an environmental scientist at Monash University, Australia."

When your colleague brings about a problem, you should _ .	"When something goes wrong, it can be very satisfying to say, ""Well, it's so-and-so's fault. ""or ""I know I'm late, but it's not my fault; the car broke down. "" It is probably not your fault, but once you form the habit of blaming somebody or something else for a bad situation, you are a loser. You have no power and could do nothing that helps change the situation. However, you can have great power over what happens to you if you stop focusing on whom to blame and start focusing on how to _ the situation. This is the winner's key to success. Winners are great at overcoming problems. For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you need to have your car examined more regularly. Or, you might start to carry along with you the useful phone numbers, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague causes you problems on the job for lack of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don't rely on this person. You should accept that the person is not reliable and find creative ways to work successfully regardless of how your colleague fails to do his job well. This is what being a winner is all about -- creatively using your skills and talents so that you are successful no matter what happens. Winners don't have fewer problems in their lives; they have just as many difficult situation to face as anybody else. They are just better at seeing those problems as challenges and opportunities to develop their own talents. So, stop focusing on ""whose fault it is. "" Once you are confident about your power over bad situations, problems are just stepping stones for success."	['find a better way to handle the problem']
The old couple spent _ getting their presents ready.	"Mr and Mrs Davies had left their Christmas shopping very late. There were only a few days more before Christmas, and of course the shops and streets were terribly crowded, but they had to get presents for their family and friends, so they started out early one morning for the big city, and spent several tiring hours buying the things they wanted in the big shops. By lunch-time, Mr Davies was carrying parcels of all shaps and sizes. He could hardly see where he was going as he and his wife left the last shop on their way to the railway station and home. Outside the shop they had to cross a busy street, made even busier than usual by the thousands of people who had come by car to do their last-minute Christmas shopping. Mr and Mrs Davies had to wait for the traffic lights to turn green, but as Mr Davies could not see very well in front of him, he gradually moved forward into the road without realizing it. Mrs Davies saw this and became worried. Several times she told her husband to come back off the road, but without success. He could not hear her because of the noise of the traffic. Finally she shouted in a voice that could be heard clearly above all the noise, ""Henry! If you want to stand in that dangerous position a moment longer, give me the parcels!"""

From the article we can infer that _ .	"It is often assumed that people with parents who lived to be very old are more likely to live to a grand old age themselves. ""But that's just not true - our study shows that hereditary factors don't play a major role and that lifestyle has the biggest impact."" says professor Lars Wilhelmsen, referring to the 1913 Men Study that formed the basis of the current research. Those who did not smoke, consumed mild amounts of coffee and had a good socio-economic status at the age of 50 (measured in terms of housing costs), as well as good physical working ability at the age of 54 and low cholesterol at 50 had the greatest chance of celebrating their 90th birthday. ""We're breaking new ground here."" says Wilhelmsen. ""Many of these factors have previously been identified as playing a role in cardiovascular( )disease, but here we are showing for the first time that they are important for survival in general,"" He believes that it is significant that the research illustrates so clearly that it is the sum of our own habits that has the biggest impact. ""The study clearly shows that we can influence several of the factors that decide how old we get,"" says Wilhelmsen. ""This is positive not only for the individual, but also for society as it doesn't need any major drug costs,"" The study has been published in the Journal of Internal Medicine. The 1913 Men study started up in 1963. A third of all male 50-year-olds in Gothenburg were called for a check-up that focused on cardiovascular health. Every ten years since, a new group of 50-year-olds has been called in and those who were already taking part in the study have been given another check-up. This has enabled researchers to follow the development of illnesses in a specific age group, and to compare the health of 50-year-olds in 2003 with that of 50-year-olds in 1963, for example. Women have also been included in the study since 2003. Data have been studied over the years. including BMI , smoking habits, cholesterol, exercise habits and blood pressure, The men born in l913 were examined when they were 50, 54,60, 67, 75 and 80. Of the 855 men who took part in the study from the start, lll (13%) were still alive at the age of 90. Over the years the material has brought out many research articles. An interesting result came in 2008 when researchers were able to show that the drop in the number of smokers, combined with lower cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure, between 1963 and 2003 could offer an explanation for the marked downturn in the number of heart attacks during this 40-year period."

According to the text, money is _ .	"Hardly a day goes by without the subject of money being raised in most people's lives. However, it is highly debatable whether money is more important than other things, such as health and happiness, which some people consider to be of greater significance. To begin with, it is often argued that having money enables people to exert their influence over others. Wealthy businessmen, for example, are often the most highly respected members of society, and business tycoons are often referred to by world leaders, who then make policies that affect the whole population. As a result, money can be seen as the single most important factor in everyday life. Secondly, from the point of view of the individual, money is vital for survival. Western society is structured in such a way that, without money, people cannot get proper nutrition and health care. Furthermore, in some cases, the inability to pay heating bills can indeed become a matter of life and death. On the other hand, many people say that one of the factors in life, which is undoubtedly of greater importance than money, is health. As Izaak Walton said, health is, ""a blessing that money cannot buy"". What is more, money is sometimes of little comfort to those who are suffering from health problems. Despite the fact that money can buy the best medical care available, it is not a guarantee of a longer life. In addition, most people would agree that personal happiness easily outweighs money in importance. Even if an individual is extremely rich, this does not necessarily lead to happiness. In some cases, the contrary is true, and vast wealth brings a whole range of problems. Genuine happiness cannot be bought and it is usually independent of financial status. On the whole, although there are those who would rank money as the single most important thing in life, we, the vast majority, would disagree."	"[""always a hot topic in people's lives""]"

To protect the environment, supermarkets in China will stop providing free plastic bags after June 1st. If you don't want to pay money to buy them, you'll have to bring your own shopping bag. What kind of bags will be the best to bring? Students in Kunming Xinying Middle School have some good ideas. Recently 54 students of the school held an activity in which they made their own environmentally-friendly shopping bags. Most students used old clothes to make their bags. They painted pictures like the Olympic rings on them. But Wang Shuncheng, a Junior 2 boy, chose a different material . He made his bag with old newspaper. Is a newspaper bag strong enough to hold shopping? Wang says it is, ""No problem. I put six bottles of water in the bag,"" he said. ""It's strong enough!"" Chen Lisi, a girl, had a more traditional way to make her bag - she weaved a bamboo basket. It was not an easy job. With her grandfather's help, Chen spent a whole afternoon making it. She also weaved wool flowers on the basket. Making bags was not all the students did. They had another job: to persuade their parents and relatives to use environmentally-friendly shopping bags instead of plastic ones. The school will show the bags so that shops and stores can get inspiration from the students' work."	['they want to protect the environment']

The guitars and songs will take me to mountains and fields. Country music usually talks of everyday life and feelings. It's the spirit of America ,easy to understand ,slow and simple. Country music developed in the Southern United States. It was the folk music of American countryside. Many of songs tell about the lives of famers . They talk about love, crops or death. The life of the countryside can be hard, so the words in country music are often sad. At first, people played the music only at family parties. But it became more popular later. In the 1920s,people played country songs on the radio, and they made them into records. When people in the countryside moved to towns and cities to look for work, they took their music with them. Country music continued to change and became popular across America. John Denver was one of America's most famous country singers in the 1970s. His song ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" is well-known and people still play it today. ,,. ( ,2,10)"	"[""farmers's feelings""]"
"What effect is produced by including the question ""Was it just luck?"" at the end of the text?"	"(This selection was originally published in 1992. Pluto is no longer classified as a planet.) Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon(called Charon). Its orbit is unusual, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze . When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane. Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow. The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet(he called it Planet X)based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these ""irregularities"" weren't real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be(although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations).In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell's last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We'll never know."

""Andrew, I was laid off today,"" he answered quietly. I was sure he was joking. ""No, you weren't. Why are you really home?"" Then I noticed his expression and realized he was telling the truth. My father has always been a hard worker and prided himself on his career. My father's unemployment created many changes in our lives. He was home all day, which meant my bed had to be made, my room cleaned up, and my homework done right after school. I would come home every day to find him at the computer searching for jobs. I began to notice how down he seemed, and how losing his job had affected his self-esteem , though he tried to be optimistic. He asked my brother and me to spend less money. I gave up my allowance , which even though it wasn't much, felt like the right thing to do. I also found a part-time job. After several difficult months of searching, my dad decided to go in a totally different direction. He explained that he never wanted to be laid off again, so he was going to start his own business. Day by day, I watched him build it, and I admired how much time and energy he devoted to it. One evening I asked if he needed help.

The writer probably got the information about the new passport photos from _ .	"The passport photographs of the future could turn out to be more than just another pretty picture if a new computer technique developed by Israeli scientists catches on. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University, in Israel, have invented a way to hide information such as a fingerprint or signature in color images. They believe this could improve passport safety or be used to produce product bar codes or designs that cannot be seen. ""The papers can be faxed, scanned and reprinted without hidden data disappearing,"" New Scientist magazine said last week. Joseph Rosen and a team of scientists worked out the new instrument by creating a mathematical model. The model turns a fingerprint or signature into a series of numbers which are used to shape the dots that make up a color picture. ""Each dot can be forced out of the usual place slightly without noticeably changing the final appearance of the image,"" the magazine said. Several images that can be hidden in a single picture are scanned into a computer which does the work. The hidden images or fingerprints cannot be shown until the picture is scanned again. The computer rebuilds the fingerprint by measuring the displacement of the dots in the picture. The magazine said that if he model is used for passport checkpoints the picture can be unscrambled to show the fingerprint or signature and checked against the person holding the passport. The researchers are now working on a handheld, and instrument which could make unscrambling the hidden information easier."	['a magazine']
The main purpose of this passage is to _ .	"I was puzzled! Why was this old woman making such a fuss about an old copse which was of no use to anybody? She had written letters to the local paper, even to a national, protesting about a projected by-pass to her village, and, looking at a map, the route was nowhere near where she lived and it wasn't as if the area was attractive. I was more than puzzled, I was curious. The enquiry into the route of the new by-pass to the village was due to take place shortly, and I wanted to know what it was that motivated her. So it was that I found myself knocking on a cottage door, being received by Mary Smith and then being taken for a walk to the woods. ""I've always loved this place,"" she said, ""it has a lot of memories for me, and for others. We all used it. They called it 'Lovers lane'. It's not much of a lane, and it doesn't go anywhere important, but that's why we all came here. To be away from people, to be by ourselves. "" she added. It was indeed pleasant that day and the songs of many birds could be heard. Squirrels watched from the branches, quite bold in their movements, obviously few people passed this way and they had nothing to fear. I could imagine the noise of vehicles passing through these peaceful woods when the by-pass was built, so _ but as I hold strong opinions about the needs of the community over-riding the opinions of private individuals, I said nothing. The village was quite a dangerous place because of the traffic especially for old people and children, their safety was more important to me than an old woman's strange ideas. ""Take this tree,"" she said pausing after a short while. ""To you it is just that, a tree. Not unlike many others here."" She gently touched the bark, ""Look here, under this branch, what can you see?"" ""It looks as if someone has done a bit of carving with a knife."" I said after a cursory inspection. ""Yes, that's what it is!"" she said softly. She went on, ""He had a penknife with a spike for getting stones from a horse's hoof, and I helped him to carve them. We were very much in love, but he was going away, and could not tell me what he was involved in the army. I had guessed of course. It was the last evening we ever spent together, because he went away the next day, back to his Unit."" Mary Smith was quiet for a while, then she sobbed. ""His mother showed me the telegram.

"" ""Two years later she too was dead. 'Pneumonia , following a chill on the chest' was what the doctor said, but I think it was an old fashioned broken heart. A child would have helped both of us."" There was a further pause. Mary Smith gently caressed the wounded tree, just as she would have caressed him. ""And now they want to take our tree away from me."" Another quiet sob, then she turned to me. ""I was young and pretty then, I could have had anybody, I wasn't always the old woman you see here now. I had everything I wanted in life, a lovely man, health and a future to look forward to."" She paused again and looked around. The breeze gently moved through the leaves with a sighing sound. ""There were others, of course, but no one can match my Robin!"" she said strongly. ""And now I have nothing - except the memories this tree holds. If only I could get my hands on that awful man who writes in the paper about the value of the road they are going to build where we are standing now, I would tell him.

The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. ""The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,"" scientists say. Fuel cell technology has been around since the 1800s, but scientists have yet been to perfect it. They say it may take years before the technology is ready for widespread use. Another earth-friendly car is already on the market. Hybrid cars use both gasoline and an electric motor. They are becoming more popular with customers because they cut pollution and improve fuel efficiency."	['future cars will be environmentally friendly']
According to the text, what causes some people to be homeless?	In many countries the standard of living enjoyed by their people has increased rapidly in recent years. Sadly, not everyone in these countries is so fortunate and many people in rich countries are homeless. The reasons for homelessness are various, but poverty is undoubtedly one of the main causes. The homeless people may have become jobless and then been unable to pay their rent and so no longer have _ . Often, the fact that unemployed people get help from the government prevents this from happening, but not always. Some homeless people are mentally ill and have no one to look after them. Some are young people who, for one reason or another, have left home and have nowhere to live. Many of them have had a serious disagreement with their parents and have left home, choosing to go to a city and live on the streets. Sometimes they have taken such action because they have been unable to get on with a step-parent. Many homeless people get into the habit of begging to get enough money to stay alive, but many of the general public refuse to give anything to beggars. Often they are moved on by the police, being accused ,whether rightly or wrongly, of forceful begging . There are many who disrespect homeless people. Some cynics declare that homeless people choose to live the life which they lead. But who would willingly choose to live in a shop doorway, under a bridge or in a cardboard box?	['Lack of money.']
If you are not so happy, you may feel that _ .	"Each week, this program explains the many meanings of English expressions. Today's expressions include a very important word--""heart"". We will try to ""get to the heart of the matter"" to better understand the most important thing about words and their stories. So ""take heart."" Have no fear about learning new expressions. Besides, popular English words can be fun. There is no need for a ""heavy heart."" Such feelings of sadness would only ""break my heart,"" or make me feel unhappy and hopeless. Now, let us suppose you and I were speaking freely about something private. We would be having a ""heart to heart"" discussion. I might speak from ""the bottom of my heart, "" or say things honestly and truthfully. I might even ""open up my heart"" to you and tell you a secret. I would speak with ""all my heart"". When a person shares her feelings freely and openly like this, you might say she ""wears her heart on her sleeve"". Her emotions are not protected. If we had an honest discussion, both of us would know that the other person's ""heart is in the right place."" For example, I would know that you are a ""kind-hearted"" and well-meaning person. And, if you are a very good person, I would even say that you have ""a heart of gold."" However, you might have a ""change of heart"" based on what I tell you. Our discussion might cause you to change the way you feel about something. But, let us suppose you get angry over what I tell you. Or worse, you feel no sympathy or understanding for me or my situation. If this happens, I might think that you have a ""heart of stone."" And, if you say something to make me frightened or worried, my ""heart might stand still""."	"['you ""break you heart""']"
In the past 20 years, _ in the U. S.	"In 1809, Mary Kies received the first U.S. patent issued to a woman. Kies , a Connecticut native , invented a process for weaving straw with silk or thread. First Lady Dolley Madison praised her for improving the nation's het industry. Unfortunately , the patent file was destroyed in a big fire in 1836. Until about 1840, only 20 U.S. patents were issued to women. The inventions were related to clothes, tools ,cook stoves and fireplaces. Patent is the ""ownership"" of an invention and only the inventor(s) can apply for it. In the past , women were not allowed to have equal rights of property ownership and many women patented their inventions under their husbands' or fathers' name. Women were also prevented from receiving higher education necessary for inventing. Here are a few examples to be noticed, and from these examples, we know enough reasons for encouraging girls and women to pursue technology-based courses and careers. The women inventors took annually granted U.S. patents rising fro;m 2.6 percent in 1977 to 10.3 percent in 1998. The majority of the U.S. woman-inventor patents are in the chemical technologies. In 1996, every eleven U.S. patent grant included one woman inventor. In the past 20 years, about 83 percent of the U. S. patent grants to women were for utility patents , 16.5 percent for design patents, and 0.5 percent for plant patents. About 35 percent of the U.S woman-inventor patents granted during the 1977 to 1996 period originated form California , New York or New Jersey. Today, hundreds of thousands of women apply for and receive patents every year. About 20% of all inventors are currently female and that number will quickly rise to 50% over the next generation."

"Why did the writer smile inside when he heard of ""Mrs. Icicle Eyes"" playing basketball with students?"	"""Men get all the breaks!"" the veteran teacher announced to me. A cold greeting. Her stare stabbed like an icicle . ""Hello,"" I countered, extending my hand. ""I guess we'll be teaching together this year."" ""I swear, all you have to do is wear pants and walk into an elementary school and they hire you! It makes me sick!"" I would have responded, but she turned her back to me and stomped off down the hall. Who would have imagined that the biggest challenge I would face during my first year on the job would not be students, but fellow teachers? ""You can't put that there!"" Another teacher burst into my classroom. ""You can't put the teacher's desk at the back of the room!"" ""Pardon?"" ""If you put your desk way back there, you won't be able to see them cheating!"" Next I was told I must not arrange student desks into abutting clusters because ""the students might talk too much."" At home my wife kept assuring me, ""You're there for the kids. When you meet your students, things will be different."" And she was right. One day the bell rang and there were thirty-five wonderful sixth graders sitting at their desks (still arranged in clusters) and it was different. I was happy. ""Welcome to sixth grade."" I began the year as I'd rehearsed for months. ""You'll notice,"" I continued, ""my desk is at the back of the room."" They chuckled. ""I don't want that desk between us. I want to be involved in your learning and involved in your lives."" In the days that followed, I ate with my students at lunch ("" _ ""); I played with my students at recess ("" _ ""); I read with my students in the library ("" _ ""); I even stayed after school with some boys who got in trouble with the principal ("" _ ""). I went home to my wife. ""Don't worry,"" she said. ""They're just threatened by you because you're new and you're good. Let the other teachers know you're not a threat. Just keep being nice to them."" Obediently, I pulled out the Golden Rule, dusted it off, and vowed to start again. As I did with the children, I started looking for specific, positive things I could build upon and reinforce sincerely in my colleagues: ""Nice job on the announcements this morning!"" ""Wow! I like that worksheet you made up."" ""Man, your kids walked down the hall so quietly."" ""I heard your class singing great songs. You do a super job with music!"" ""I like your bulletin board,"" I said to Mrs. Icicle Eyes. ""Really?"" she asked. ""It's just the same old thing I put up every year."" She reached out and straightened a sagging border. Then, not unlike one of my students, she added, ""Do you really like it?"" ""Yes,"" I answered firmly. As sure as sun beams, the Golden Rule was shining, and things were finally warming up. That very afternoon, a few parents went to the principal's office asking if their sixth graders could be moved into my class. Of course the students were not transferred, but when the grapevine circulated the request, up went the old barbed wire fence. Complete with machine guns. I continued to do the best job I could. I worked. I taught. I cared. I waited for a breakthrough moment. Months passed. It was lunch recess. I asked a boy walking down the hall. ""Have you seen Mrs. So-and-So?"" I was, in fact, searching for Mrs. Icicle Eyes. I needed to consult with her. Grinning, he came toward me as if sharing a secret. ""She's outside shooting baskets with the girls!"" ""She's playing basketball with the girls?"" I asked incredulously. ""Yeah,"" he nodded. I smiled. I didn't say another word. But my smile inside was even bigger than the one on my face."

What is the purpose of the passage?	"""Teenager"" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that ""kids are getting older younger"". With such maturity at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children."	['To introduce a new phenomenon .']
What is the best job for you to choose according to the writer?	In this fast-shifting world, there can be no guarantees attached to any particular job. But there is much that you can do to protect yourself from the change of society, by equipping yourself with the skills to manage your career more effectively. You need to be a career activist. If you lost your main source of income tomorrow, could you find a different source to replace it? The most important thing in protecting yourself now and in the future is ensuring that you have choices. Don't let yourself be held back by a lack of skill development, or fear of change. Some people have been good performers in their own organization but discovered that they are stuck. Because they are so closely related to a particular company or industry, their skills are not readily transferred to other jobs. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you limit yourself to one particular area or sector, you limit your opportunity, too. In a global market place, many jobs come and go quickly as changes in the stock market. Today's hottest job may not exist tomorrow. If you love computers, then this work represents a great choice. But don't enter a field just because you think that's where the hot jobs are; even if the job is available, it may not match well with your own skills and abilities. Start with entry of your own strengths and interests, then see where you may match up best in the job market.	['Something involving your strengths and interests.']
What happened when the big fish turned out to be a bass?	"Once there was an 11-year-old boy who went fishing with his father in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before bass season opened, they were fishing early in the evening, catching other fish with worms. Then the boy tied on a small silver lure and put it into the lake. Suddenly he felt that something very big pulling on the lure. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully brought the fish beside the bank. Finally he lifted the tired fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass. The boy and his father looked at the big fish. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 p.m.--two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. ""You'll have to put it back, son,"" he said. ""Dad!"" cried the boy. ""There will be other fish,"" said his father. ""Not as big as this one,"" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were in sight in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he had caught the fish, the boy could tell from his father's voice that the decision couldn't be changed. He threw the huge bass into the black water. The big fish disappeared. The boy thought that he would never again see such a big fish. That was 34 years ago. Today the boy is a successful architect in New York City. He often takes his own son and daughters to fish at the same place. And he was right. He has never again caught such a large fish as the one he got that night long ago. But he does see that same fish ... again and again ... every time he has an ethical decision to make. For, as his father had taught him, ethics are simple matters of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethics that is difficult."	['The father lit a match in order to check the time.']
Annealing can make metal _ .	Annealing is a way of making metal softer by heating it and then letting it cool very slowly. If metal is heated and then cooled very quickly , for example by dipping it in water , it will be very hard but also very brittle ---that is , It will break easily. Metal that has been annealed is soft but does not break as easily . It is possible to make metal as hard or as soft as is wished, by annealing it. The metal is heated, and allowed to cool slowly , for a certain length of time. The longer the heated metal takes to cool slowly , the softer it becomes . Annealing can also be used on other materials, such as glass.	['soft but tough']
While watching TV with others, women usually talk a lot because they _ .	When women sit together to watch a movie on TV, they usually talk simultaneously about a variety of subjects, including children, men, careers and what's happening in their lives. When groups of men and women watch a movie together, the men usually end up telling the women to shut up. Men can either talk or watch the screen--they can't do both--and they don't understand that women can. Besides, women consider that the point of all getting together is to have a good time and develop relationships--not just to sit there like couch potatoes staring at the screen. During the ad breaks, a man often asks a woman to explain the plot and tell him where the relationship between the characters is going. He is unable, unlike women, to read the subtle body language signals that reveal how the characters are feeling emotionally. Since women originally spent their days with the other women and children in the group, they developed the ability to communicate successfully in order to maintain relationships. For a woman, speech continues to have such a clear purpose: to build relationships and make friends. For men, to talk is to relate the facts. Men see the telephone as a communication tool for sending facts and information to other people, but a woman sees it as a means of bonding . A woman can spend two weeks on vacation with her girlfriend and, when she returns home, telephone the same girlfriend and talk for another two hours. There is no convincing evidence that social conditioning, the fact that girls' mothers talked to them more, is the reason why girls talk more than boys. Psychiatrist Dr Michael Lewis, author of Social Behaviour and Language Acquisition, conducted experiments that found mothers talked to, and looked at, baby girls more often than baby boys. Scientific evidence shows parents respond to the brains of their children. Since a girl's brain is better organized to send and receive speech, we therefore talk to them more. Consequently, mothers who try to talk to their sons are usually disappointed to receive only short grunts in reply.	['think they can have a good time and develop relationships']
Which of the following is the best title?	"Every year in late April, students at Renmin University of China become the subjects of admiration and jealousy of their peers on other campuses in Beijing. Why? Because they get a week off in the middle of term, the so-called spring break. "" _ 's been a unique tradition of our school for a decade,"" said Wang Yueran, 20, a journalism major at Renmin University, who organized a weeklong trip to Sichuan with 12 classmates last year. But having fun is just one dimension of the spring break. Field trips, voluntary work, and social projects are all on students' to-do lists. Experts say the spring break is not just for students to enjoy a few days off, but for them to gain new experiences beyond the campus walls. Push them out The traditional Chinese belief of the exploration of knowledge and truth emphasizes ""reading 10,000 books and traveling 10,000 miles"", which indicates the importance of experience as much as theory. But while Chinese universities have the tradition of spring outings, what's the benefit of making spring break an institution? Qin Jianguo, of the student affairs office at Shenzhen University, thinks the idea of the spring break in some universities in China comes from the intention of pushing students out of the ivory tower to experience more diversity in their lives. ""Take traveling for example. A week traveling is a very different experience to a one- or two-day outing,"" said Qin. ""Students are expected to acquire the spirit of teamwork and compromise, and learn survival and communication skills when put out there in an unfamiliar context."" Diverse approaches Many countries have similar vacations in the middle of the semester for students to do things out of their own interest. Taking Japan as an example, instead of partying like their US counterparts, many Japanese students choose to work as interns or engage in study-related projects. ""The spring break is an opportunity for many of our students to put their learning to use,"" said Hiroshi Kanno, dean of the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy at Hitotsubashi University, in the school's description of a recent spring break project. As for Chinese students who take a week off around the Labor Day holiday, many tend to do volunteer work. Duan Zhipeng, a 22-year-old economics major at Renmin University, applied for a project to go back to his hometown in Jiangxi province to introduce his university's enrollment policies and campus culture to local high school students. Not a trend yet Apart from Renmin University, only a few other universities, such as Yantai University, have a spring break for their students. The concept in China is still far from the culture and norms built around it in the US. Wei Xiang, a professor specializing in holiday economics at Beijing International Studies University, said that the spring break is a good experiment for universities to make study schedules smoother in order to give students more options to arrange their own leisure and study activities."

Commuters in carpools probably _	Rush hour traffic is a problem in many big cities around the world. Commuters rush to and from their jobs in cars, buses, subways, trains, and even on bicycles. Large cities in the United States have two rush hours--one in the morning and one in the evening. But in cities in other parts of the world, there are four rush hours. In Athens and Rome, for example, many workers go home for lunch and a nap. After this midday break, they rush back to their jobs and work for a few more hours. In Tokyo, there's a big rush hour underground. Most of the people in Tokyo take the subways. The trains are very crowded. Subway employees called packers wear white gloves and help pack the commuters into the trains when the doors close. They make sure that all purses, briefcases, clothes, and hands are inside the trains. In Seoul, many commuters prefer to take taxis to get to work.. To hail a cab,many people stand at crossroads and raise two fingers. This means they'll pay the cab driver double the usual fare. Some people even raise three fingers! They'll pay three times the normal rate. Streets in Rome are very crowded with automobiles and mopeds during rush hours. The city can't make its streets wider, and it can't build new highways, because it doesn't want to disturb the many historic sites in the city, such as the Forum and the Coliseum. It took the city fifteen years to construct a new subway system. Construction had to stop every time workers found old artifacts and discovered places of interest to archaeologists . In many big cities, there are special lanes on highways for carpools. These are groups of three or more people who drive to and from work together. They share the costs of gas and parking and take turns driving into the city. Getting to work and getting home can be difficult in many places around the world. Rush hour traffic seems to be a universal problem.	['save money on gas and parking fees']

Black bears have a good sense of _ .	American black bears appear in a variety of colors despite their name. In the eastern part, most of these bears have shiny black fur, but in the west they grow brown, red, or even yellow coats. To the north, the black bear is actually gray or white in color. Even in the same litter , both brown and black furred bears may be born. Black bears are the smallest of all American bears, ranging in length from five to six feet, weighing from three hundred to five hundred pounds. Their eyes and ears are small and their eyesight and hearing are not as good as their sense of smell. Like all bears, the black bear is timid and rarely dangerous, but if attacked, most can climb trees or cover ground at great speed. When angry or frightened, they are formidable _ . Black bears feed on leaves, roots, fruit, insects, fish, and even larger animals. One of the most interesting characteristics of bears, including the black bear, is their winter sleep. Unlike squirrels and many other woodland animals, bears do not actually sleep through the winter months. Although the bear does not eat during the winter months, sustaining itself from body fat, its temperature remains almost normal, and it breathes regularly four or five times per minute. Most black bears live alone, except during the mating season. They prefer to live in caves. Baby black bears are born in January or February after a gestation period of six to nine months, and they stay with their mother until they are fully grown or about one and a half years old. Black bears can live as long as thirty years in the wild, and even longer in some nature reserves.	['smell']

From the passage, we can learn that _ .	"Several years ago, I taught teenagers with feeling troubles in a group home. These very tough kids often came directly from prison to my classroom. They often wanted to escape from the group home. They were society's ""throwaway"" kids--youngsters without families to love and care for them. They desperately needed to receive love. Then I found one thing more important for them. So, when a friend suggested an idea, I thought it would be a great program for my students. The plan was simple. We arranged that every Wednesday morning, I'd bring over my little crew, and they were supposed to clean the runs, wash dog and cat bowls, and feed the animals at our local animal shelter. Then came the risky part of the program. After doing their chores, the youngsters would earn the freedom to walk one of the dogs in the wooded area behind the shelter, where I couldn't even see them. We began the project. Each week, I carefully went over the list of students who had met the requirements. All that week, students worked hard to control their tempers and be cooperative. I emphasized how much the animals needed their love and care. As they served the animals, the youngsters were transforming before our eyes. Never before had they been considered contributing members of society. Yet now these kids begged to volunteer at the shelter. As we had planned, my students walked the dogs, unwatched, in the woods for up to half an hour. I impressed on each of them my trust and respect that they'd bring back the animal in their care safely and on time. Remarkably, I never lost a student or an animal. The world might not have needed or might have forgotten about my kids, but the animals didn't. these shining animals showed some very needy kids the way back home from heartbreak and abuse."

What can we know from the passage?	My favourite restaurant is called 'Annablella's cafe'. It is a small restaurant serving Western food. It is in a city called Bristol.

They know what my favourite drink is, so when I arrive, there is always a bottle of coke on the table. The menu changes every week so there is always something different to eat. My favourite meat is chicken, so I always order something with chicken in it. For dessert , I usually have apple pie with custard or chocolate cake. Delicious!

When the parents don't understand you, you can _ .	"Do you often talk with your parents? Here is some advice on how to talk with them. Try to start your talk with something fun. This will make talking easier. For example, ask them questions about their day. How is work? They love this. Make it clear what you want to tell your parents. If they have an opinion, let them finish and don't stop their talking. Ask them to do the same for you. Show them respect by listening to them carefully. Look at them in the eye. Be honest. Honesty builds trust. Life is good when your parents trust you. If your parents don't understand, that's OK. It doesn't mean that they don't love you. Sometimes you have to explain the things to them again. When you finish the talk, thank them for listening. Say something like ""Thanks, that helps."" It will let them know that is important to you and make them want to do it more often."	['explain your ideas to them again']
The author writes the passage mainly _ .	Fruit or juice, which is nutritionally superior? This is almost the same as the age-old question: The chicken or the egg, which came first? Usually, juicers remove the juice and some pulp from fruits and/or vegetables.It takes a lot of fruit to make a container of juice.We do get all of the vitamins, minerals, beneficial plant chemicals and carbohydrates in juice out of a whole fruit.But we do not get much of the fiber, the part that aids our digestive process, fills us up, and may help protect us against heart diseases and certain cancers. However, you may be surprised to discover that some juices actually contain more necessary nutrients .For example, apples are not a good source of vitamin C, but many types of apple juice are fortified with vitamin C. Juice has more calories than fresh fruit due to added sugar and less fiber.If calories are your primary concern, choose fresh fruit over juice and drink water if you are thirsty.We do not feel as filled up from juice because it does not contain any fiber.For many people, drinking a caloric beverage , such as juice, is not as satisfying as eating the same amount of calories in food.For those of us who need to increase caloric intake (such as athletes, children, or teens) juice is a GREAT choice. Kids love the taste of pure fruit juice, and parents love it because it is a healthy source of nutrients.But avoid junk fruit beverages which are mistaken for juice blends that contain various fruits like grape, apple and pear.These juices do not have the natural levels of vital nutrients that 100 percent pure juices like orange juice provide.

We can learn from the passage that _ .	Finding a good friend can be quite difficult in the contemporary lives of teenagers. I was once baffled by what the definition of a good friend was,until I discovered a single step that,if taken,would make you the greatest friend. It is willingness. That is all it takes in order to be considered a good friend. Willingness must come from within your heart. Listening to your friends makes them feel important, special and wanted. The will to sacrifice for your friends will also take you a step closer to being a good friend. For instance,as you are about to leave to enjoy your Saturday night,your best friend calls you right when you are stepping out and tells you how terrible he feels,and then you must be willing to give up your Saturday night and go to your friend's house and try to comfort him in any way that you can. You must always be willing to give advice to your friends. For example, if your friends are in a situation where they do not know what to do,you must be willing to think things through and try to give them the best advice. The willingness to care is also a big must in being a good friend. You must care about how your friends feel and what they're experiencing. Caring about your friends is one of the best things you can do,because when your friends are in their time of need and the whole world seems to turn against them,you must be the one to care. Nobody ever said being a good friend was easy. If you want to be a good friend,you have to be willing to listen, sacrifice,give advice and care about your friends.

Why was the Heidelbergdiscovery a breakthrough?	"German academics believe they have solved the centuries-old mystery of the ""Mona Lisa"" in Leonardo ad Vinci's famous portrait . Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, has long been seen as the most likely model for the sixteenth-century painting. Art historians have wondered whether the smiling woman may actually have been da Vinci's lover or mother, or the artist himself. Now experts at the prefix = st1 /HeidelbergUniversitylibrary say old notes made in a book by its owner in October, 1503, confirm that Lisa del Giocondo was indeed the model for the famous portrait in the world. ""All doubts about the identity of the Mona Lisa have been removed by a discovery by Dr. Armin Schlechter,"" the library said in a statement on Monday. ""Until then, only 'scant evidence' from sixteenth-century documents had been available. These had left lots of room for doubt, and many different identities were put forward."" The comments compare Leonardo to the ancient Greek artist Apelles, and say he was working on three paintings at that time, one of which was a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. Art experts say the Heidelbergdiscovery is a break-through, and the earliest mention linking the merchant's wife to the portrait. Before this discovery the earliest link dated from around 1550, and was made by Italian official Giorgio Vasari, the library said, adding that there had been doubts about Vasari's reliability. The Heidelbergnotes were actually discovered over two year's ago in the library by Schlechter, a spokeswoman said. Although the findings were published in the library's catalogue, they were not widely publicized, and received little attention until a German broadcaster decided to do some recording there, she said."

Why does your dog use his nose when looking for orange, yellow or green toys in the grass?	There are four main areas when it comes to your dog's body language -- his ears and face, eyes, nose and tail. If you pay attention to those things, you'll find you are able to easily understand how your dog is feeling. Ears and face The head of a dog is more expressive than you think. If you say a word that he recognizes, like his name or something you say often, his ears will get up. His mouth is another good instruction. A mouth that is wide open to pant with some sound suggests that the dog is happy -- some people even say when a dog is panting, he is laughing as he cools himself. A tongue sticking out suggests that the dog is in a good mood. Eyes To a dog, purple and blue are both seen as shades of blue. Red is seen as black or dark grey. Orange, yellow and green are seen as various shades of yellow. This means that, to a dog, bright orange toys are the same yellow shade. If you want your dog to clearly see his toys in the green grass you'd better give the dog blue toys; if you have orange, yellow or green toys, the dog will be able to find them with his nose. Nose A dog can both sniff and breathe through his nose. Breathing is for air, but when dogs sniff with short breaths they are actually following some scents with his keen nose. When a dog is overheated, his sense of smell is reduced by as much as 40 percent and he uses the air to cool himself rather than for smelling. Puppies' noses can help find their mother when their eyes and ears are closed. The function will disappear by the time they are adults. Tail Lastly, you need to pay attention to your dog's tail, because it shows what he is thinking and feeling. A dog that is in a good mood will have a tail that seems to be going a mile a minute -- wagging, and excited. However, an angry or frightened dog will have his tail between his legs.	['Because these colors are all shades of yellow in his eyes.']
Which is NOT TRUE according to the passage?	Almost every family in America or England buys at least one copy of a newspaper each day. Some people buy as many as two or three different papers. Why do people read newspapers? Newspapers supply us with news about events in our hometowns, in our country, and in other parts of the world. Today we can read about important things that took place in foreign countries on the same day they happened, even in countries far away. But hundreds of years ago, news of things took months or even years to travel from one country to another. In those times, news was often passed from one person to another and never completely true. Newspapers today supply us with more than just what happened in our country or in other countries. If we want to know what the weather will be like, we can read the weather reports. If we want to find out what films are being shown, or what plays or concerts we can go to we can look in the newspapers. In many countries people put notices in newspapers if they are trying to get a job, hunting for a house or rooms that they can rent, or even when looking for a person who is lost.	['If you have no place to live in, you can put notice in a newspaper and then you will certainly get a room to live in.']
What directly led IKEA to adopt CGI on a larger scale?	"It's hard to be the bearer of bad news,but most of IKEA's print and digital fascinating shots of picturesque rooms and products are fake.Those beautiful,""natural-looking"" photos of gorgeous rooms and kitchens are mostly the work of computer magic,adjusted and corrected until they're picture-perfect. Martin Enthed,IT manager for IKEA's in-house communications agency,revealed,""In 2012,12 per cent of its product and concept images was CGI-rendered,increasing to 25 per cent in 2013.Since then,that percentage of rendered images appearing in the company's catalogue and online has tripled.75 per cent of the furniture company's product images today are created by computers."" It's a move that first caught the attention of photographers and graphic designers a few years back when the furniture giant announced it would cancel photoshoots in favor of computer-generated imagery(CGI). Enthed said IKEA began shifting equipment in 2009 when company officials called in his team and said they weren't pleased with some previous photos and CG images. ""So we looked at all the images they said weren't good and the two of three they said were great,and the ones they didn't like were photography and the good ones were all CG,""Enthed said.""Now we only talk about a good or bad image - not what technique created it."" It's a not-so-secret strategy used by top companies specializing in home and furniture design,though many consumers remain oblivious. The company claims the shift is another way to reduce its environmental footprint,saying constructing digital files produces less waste.It also helps the home furnishing empire's pocketbooks."

What can we know from the passage?	"The day was Thankful Thursday. It's a weekly tradition that my two little girls and I began years ago. Thursday has become our day to go out and make a positive contribution. On this particular Thursday, we had no idea exactly what we were going to do. At noon, I drove to a McDonald's with my daughters because they kept complaining that they hadn't had enough to eat at breakfast. There we saw some homeless people in the street and we bought lunch for them. We were about to complete when we found a small woman standing at the corner, asking for change. We handed her some food, and then started to head home. Suddenly from the mirror of the car, I saw the woman waving at us, so I had to turn around and stopped where the small woman stood. She walked to our car, and said, ""Thank you, lady! No one has ever done anything like this for me before."" I replied, ""Well, I'm glad that we were the first."" Feeling uneasy, and wanting to move the conversation along, I asked, ""So, when do you think you'll eat your lunch?"" She just looked at me with her huge, tired brown eyes and said, ""Oh honey, I'm not going to eat this lunch."" I was confused, but before I could say anything, she continued. ""You see, I have a little girl of my own at home and she just loves McDonald's, but I can never buy it for her because I just don't have the money. But you know what...tonight she is going to have McDonald's!"" I don't know if the kids noticed the tears in my eyes. So many times I had questioned whether our Acts of Kindness were too small to have effect on those poor people. Yet at that moment, I realized the truth of Mother Teresa's words: ""We cannot do great things -- only small things with great love."""

But now, you know, with the influence of different holiday drinks ... I think I like coffee as well as tea now."" Yang Lin says that drinking coffee for her is a social event. She and her workmates like to sit in a cafe and talk over a cup of coffee. Tea, she says, is more about family memories. She grew up in Fujian Province -- an area known for its tea.

Which of the following is NOT the suggested things to think about when you exercise?	We've all heard about the power of positive thinking, but a recent study found that people who think they're getting fit actually get more positive benefits from activity, according to a Reuters Health article. The study examined hotel housekeepers over a period of four weeks. Some of the housekeepers were told that their work duties gave them enough activity to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines . Another group of housekeepers were told nothing. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work activity counted as exercise lost weight and body fat, and their blood pressure went down. The results of this study suggest that it's important to understand and believe in the positive benefits of your activity. So here are a few things to think about the next time you exercise: Just thirty minutes of quick walking each day can greatly reduce your risk of a heart attack. Even your housework -- like yard work and house cleaning -- can help you burn calories and increase your fitness levels. Weight bearing activity just a few times a week can build bone density and reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis . Three 10-minute workouts throughout the day are just as good to your health as one long workout. Moderate amounts of exercise have been linked to lower rates of heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Strength training can help make daily activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier. Regular exercise will reduce stress, keep you in a good mood and improve the quality of your sleep.

If you work in an industry exposed to asbestos, you should _ .	Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it. What is Mesothelioma? Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma. What causes Mesothelioma? Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos. How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma? Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure. How quickly does Mesothelioma progress? The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately. Can Mesothelioma be treated? Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately. What legal courses of action can be taken? Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation.	['go to hospital and have your body examined']

How many steps do the students need to read the notes from digital cameras?	With the development of science, more and more students don't like taking notes by hand. Instead, they use digital cameras to take pictures of the words that their teachers write on the blackboard or record what their teachers say in class. The children might think there are too many notes to take or their teachers write or speak so fast that they can't take more specific notes. They are trying to find ways to make things easier, so they use digital cameras. In fact, children are very clever to make use of technology . But do digital cameras really make taking notes easier? Not really. Before you read notes from digital cameras, there are a lot of things you have to do. To begin with, you have to find a computer. Then you need to copy the photos into the computer. Next, you have to find a printer to print the photos. Another thing is that you can't hear the sound from the digital cameras clearly because there is usually lots of _ . You will have to listen to it slowly several times before you understand everything. In fact, taking notes by hand has many advantages. For example, it can help you remember and understand what you are learning. In order to save time, you can choose the most important things or the things you don't understand to write down. You don't have to write down everything. Don't be afraid to take notes by hand. It's really an effective way.	['Three.']

Two kinds of Sushi, Edo and Osaka, were probably named after _ .	Sushi is a kind of food made with a mixture of cooked or raw fish, vegetables, and rice. Although Sushi is most commonly considered to have its origin in Japan, it actually began in China during the 7thCentury. At that time, any fish caught had to be preserved. Raw fish was cleaned and then pressed between layers of heavy salt. After a couple of months, the whole process was complete. Over time, a discovery was made that by rolling the fish in rice that had been soaked in vinegar the fish was easily fermented in a few days rather than months. The rice was then thrown away and the fish was eaten. However, with a food shortage, people began consuming the rice as well as the fish and thus, Sushi today as we know was born. However, in the 1800s, a famous chef by the name of Yohei created two styles of Sushi--one called Edo, and the second, Osaka, for two cities. Sushi is usually consumed with hot green tea. Also, Gari is offered free and eaten between bites to create a better taste. Two kinds of sauce are usually available: one is soy sauce, which is poured on most kinds of Sushi; the other is a thick sweet sauce used on eel . Sushi has taken the world by storm and today is a multi-billion dollar industry. Its popularity continues to rise because people are looking for healthy food that is quick and easy to make. With such unbelievable popularity as well as the health benefits of eating Sushi, it is likely that this food will continue to be a part of everyday life for many more centuries to come.

What can you learn from the passage?	With golden sunshine and a gentle breeze , autumn is the most beautiful seasons in the year. This is a great time to go outside and have fun. Go to a valley to see red maple trees , go and pick fruit in an orchard or find an open field to fly your kite in. However, for many high school students, these great activities may be just a dream. With plenty of work to do, they spend all their hours indoors, struggling for a high mark in their exams. Of course, study is one of the most important things for teenagers. But life is definitely much more than that. Sometimes we spend so much time studying that we forget how to make life wonderful. In doing so, we lose the real purpose of life --to be a valuable and happy person. To enjoy just how great it is to be alive, we have to put down our books and pens and look around us. Students, take some exercise to improve your health, talk with your parents and friends for understanding and walk around outside to refresh your body and mind. Going out and enjoying the beautiful countryside often helps our creativity in our work. Chinese craftsman, Lu Ban created a saw to help woodworkers. But if he hadn't walked outside, he would not have been inspired by a kind of toothed grass. We could also suppose if Newton hadn't rested under that apple tree, then he wouldn't have been hit by an apple, and his classic theories would not have come out. Going out is not only a break from hard work, but a chance to add to life experience. So come on, give your brain a good rest. Step out of the books and get your bag ready for an autumn outing. We are sure you will get much more than knowledge from the exciting journey.	['Going out can make high school students get more.']

But there's a new application that just may. Today, the VALK Foundation, a Dutch group that's a partnership between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the University of Leiden, launches the app in the US. The VALK Foundation was one of the first centers for research and fear-of-flying treatment in the world and is the organizer of three world conferences on fear of flying.The foundation said the app, called Flight App VALK, is the first scientifically-developed, web-based treatment for people who suffer from mild to moderate fear of flying. ""The fear of flying application we have created aims to transfer all of the knowledge we have developed through our program into a mobile application that will help ease travelers' fears,"" said Dr. Lucas van Gerwen, director of the VALK Foundation. Dr. van Gerwen is also a psychologist and professional pilot with more than 30 years experience. The foundation said up to 30% of adults are fearful fliers. The Flight App is designed to help relax passengers before and during flights by educating users about flight safety and turbulence. It explains the sounds and sensations they can expect during departure, flight and landing. And, if a passenger's flight stress reaches a panic level, they press a special panic button which provides audio and written information to help decrease stress levels. Most importantly, the Flight App can be used during the flight in the airplane mode. Once downloaded, the program does not require Internet connection in the air."

What time does Jack have breakfast at weekends?	I'm Jack. I'm a middle school student. I have lessons from Monday to Friday. At weekends, I usually get up very late. I wash my face, brush my teeth and then go out to do morning exercises. I eat my breakfast at about nine o'clock. After that, I often go to the park with my parents. The park is a little far from our home, so we go there by bus. It often takes us about twenty minutes to get there by bus. The park is very beautiful. There are always lots of people in the park. There are men and women, old and young. Parents must take good care of their children. There is a large lake in the middle of the park. I often go swimming there. Sometimes, I fly kites. We always have a good time there.	['At about 9:00.']
The true cost of saving a baby may be even more than 1 million because _ .	"When Christie Andrews was born, she weighed less that half of one kilogram. Her heart was the size of a large coin. Her mother said Christie was so small that she could hold her in the palm of one hand. Christie couldn't breathe without a machine to give her oxygen. If she had been born 20 years earlier, she would probably have died at once. She needed two operations, but she survived without serious damage. Twenty years ago , 90% of all premature babies died. Today, doctors manage to save four out of every five, because they have better machines for breathing and better ways to feed the babies. But saving Christie's life cost more than $ 400,000. In some cases, doctors spend 1 million dollars saving a single child. The parents usually don't have enough money to pay. The government, an insurance company or the hospital picks up the bill. Even after a baby goes home from the hospital, it may require medical care. Some people think it makes more sense to spend money saving 10 adults who have cancer or other diseases than saving one small baby. But nobody wants to be the doctor who has to tell parents to their faces, ""Sorry, I won't save your new child."""	['the baby may require medical care after it leaves the hospital']
What is the subject discussed in the text?	"If you ask people to name the one person who had the greatest effect on the English language, you will get answers like ""Shakespeare,"" ""Samuel Johnson,"" and ""Webster,"" but none of these men had any effect at all compared to a man who didn't even speak English--William the Conqueror . Before 1066, in the land we now call Great Britain lived people belonging to two major language groups. In the west-central region lived the Welsh, who spoke a Celtic language, and in the north lived the Scots, whose language, though not the same as Welsh, was also Celtic. In the rest of the country lived the Saxons, actually a mixture of Anglos, Saxons, and other Germanic and Nordic peoples, who spoke what we now call Anglo-Saxon (or Old English), a Germanic language. If this state of affairs had lasted, English today would be close to German. But this state of affairs did not last. In l066 the Normans led by William defeated the Saxons and began their rule over England. For about a century, French became the official language of England while Old English became the language of peasants. As a result, English words of politics and the law come from French rather than German. In some cases, modern English even shows a distinction between upper-class French and lower-class Anglo-Saxon in its words. We even have different words for some foods, meat in particular, depending on whether it is still out in the fields or at home ready to be cooked, which shows the fact that the Saxon peasants were doing the farming, while the upper-class Normans were doing most of the eating. When Americans visit Europe for the first time, they usually find Germany more ""foreign"" than France because the German they see on signs and advertisements seems much more different from English than French does. Few realize that the English language is actually Germanic in its beginning and that the French influences are all the result of one man's ambition ."

From the article, we can conclude that Alice Wilder _ .	"Alice Wilder, a 17-year-old student at Northwest School of the Arts in North Carolina, considers herself a feminist . She is one of 26 bloggers for SPARK, an international group founded in 2010. The group fights the use of the female body as a marketing tool in the media. Alice found out about SPARK when the organization launched a campaign demanding Seventeen Magazine feature a more diverse group of models. She applied to be a blogger for the group in May and won one of the positions. Each month, Alice pitches (...) her girl -and women - centric blog post ideas via online chat to an editor at SPARK. So far, she has written about topics such as female actresses, choosing what to wear, and dealing with anger. Alice said she hopes large companies and media stop editing images of women. Increases in bust size, decreases in waist size, smoothing and whitewashing skin are what Alice notes. ""We want them to know that these images are bad for our development,"" Alice said. ""Three out of four teen girls feel bad about themselves after reading a fashion magazine for three minutes,"" she said, according to SPARK's research. Alice first felt it necessary to advocate for women in the fifth grade, after seeing a girl's T-shirt with writing on the front that read: ""Who needs brains when you have these?"" ""I was raised with this idea that if you don't like something, you can change it,"" Alice said. So Alice started following feminist bloggers. Alice juggles class work with blogging and creating videos and serves as editor-in-chief of her school's newspaper. It is amazing that she can handle everything well at the same time. She's also focused on creating projects that aim to inspire girls - like designing a ""girl power bathroom"" at her school. The newly designed third-floor restroom is completed with pastel paint color1s and inspirational quotes from women around the world. ""Sisterhood is powerful,"" Alice said. ""It can make you feel less alone."""	['is a critical thinker and works hard for her goals']
Mrs. Clarke looked forward to Thursday because _ .	"On Thursday afternoon Mrs. Clarke, dressed for going out, took her handbag with her money and her key in it, pulled the door behind her to lock it and went to the over 60s Club. She always went there on Thursdays. It was a nice outing for an old woman who lived alone. At six o'clock she came home, let herself in and at once smelt cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke in her house? How? How? Had someone got in? She checked the back door and the windows. All were locked or fastened, as usual. There was no sign of forced entry. Over a cup of tea she wondered whether someone might have a key that fitted her front door -- "" _ "" perhaps. So she stayed at home the following Thursday. Nothing happened. Was anyone watching her movements? On the Thursday after that she went out at her usual time, dressed as usual, but she didn't go to the club. Instead she took a short cut home again, letting herself in through her garden and the back door. She settled down to wait. It was just after four o'clock when the front door bell rang. Mrs. Clarke was making a cup of tea at the time. The bell rang again, and then she heard her letter-box being pushed open. With the kettle of boiling water in her hand, she moved quietly towards the front door. A long piece of wire appeared through the letter-box, and then a hand. The wire turned and caught around the handle on the door-lock. Mrs. Clarke raised the kettle and poured the water over the hand. There was a shout outside, and the skin seemed to drop off the fingers like a glove. The wire fell to the floor, the hand was pulled back, and Mrs. Clarke heard the sound of running feet."

What does the passage mainly talk about?	"Holding a cell phone against your ear or storing it in your pocket may be dangerous to your health. This explains a warning that cell phone manufacturers include in the small print that is often ignored when a new phone is purchased. Apple, for example, doesn't want iPhones to come closer to you than 1.5 centimeters; Research In Motion, BlackBerry's manufacturer, recommends 2.5 centimeters. If health issues arise from cell phone use, the possible effects are huge. Voice calls - Americans chat on cell phones 2.26 trillion minutes annually - earn $109 billion for the wireless carriers. Devra Davis, an expert who has worked for the University of Pittsburgh, has published a book about cell phone radiation, ""Disconnect."" The book surveys scientific research and concludes the question is not settled. Brain cancer is a concern that Ms. Davis examines. Over all, there has not been an increase in its incidence since cell phones arrived. But the average masks an increase in brain cancer in the 20-to-29 age group and a drop for the older population. ""Most cancers have multiple causes,"" she says, but she points to laboratory research that suggests low-energy radiation could damage cells that could possibly lead to cancer. Children are more _ to radiation than adults, Ms. Davis and other scientists point out. Radiation that penetrates only five centimeters into the brain of an adult will reach much deeper into the brains of children because their skulls are thinner and their brains contain more absorptive fluid . No studies have yet been completed on cell phone radiation and children, she says. Henry Lai, a research professor in the bioengineering department at the University of Washington, began laboratory radiation studies in 1980 and found that rats exposed to radiation had damaged DNA in their brains. Ms. Davis recommends using wired headsets or the phone's speaker. Children should text rather than call, she said, and pregnant women should keep phones away from the abdomen ."

The reason people grind their teeth is that they _ .	There are always times in the day when you catch yourself clenching your teeth if you are trying to focus on something important or concentrating on something. Of course, if you are doing this in your sleep you won't be able to catch yourself and stop. The good news is that there are things you can do to help relieve the pain that is caused from bruxism and help keep your teeth healthy as well. If you wake up in the moming with sore jaws, pain in your neck and shoulders, or a persistent headache, you are more than likely to have bruxism. A lot of medical professionals think that a major aspect of bruxism is from stress. Everyday life can be filled with stressful situations and this stress gets released at night when you are sleeping. If you suffer from stress on a regular basis you can try a relaxation technique before you go to bed. The hope is that by relaxing your body and mind you will let go of the stress that will cause you to grind your teeth while you are sleeping. This routine has worked for millions of people and is a good thing to try first. While relaxation to relieve stress sounds pretty good, there are people that this technique doesn't work for. For these people, there are mouth guards that you can wear while you are sleeping that will help protect your teeth. These mouth guards will put a protective layer between your teeth in order to ease any issues that grinding your teeth may cause. If you want to get the best possible relief you should try both the relaxation techniques and a mouth guard. The mouth guard will keep your teeth from damage and the relaxation techniques will help ease the stress that your body might be feeling. Nothing can be better than relieving both pain and stress when you need it most, while you are sleeping.	['feel stressed in their daily life']
When was paper first made in southern Europe?	How much paper do you use every year? Maybe you can't answer this question quickly. In 1900 the world's use of paper was about one kilogram for each person in a year. Now some countries use 50 kilograms of paper for each person in a year. But countries like America, England and Sweden certainly use more paper than other countries. Paper was first made in China about 2000 years ago. It was made from the hair-like parts of certain plants. Paper was not made in southern Europe until about the year 1100. In 1500, a German named Schaeffer found out that one could make the best paper from trees. After that the forest countries of Canada, Sweden, America, Finland became the most important ones in paper making. When we think of paper, we think of newspapers, books and writing paper. But there are many other uses. Only half of the paper is used for books and things like that. Paper is very good for keeping you warm. Houses are often insulated(, ) with paper. You may see some men asleep on a large number of newspapers. They're insulating themselves from the cold. In Finland the temperature is sometimes -40 centigrade (C). The farmers wear paper boots in the snow. Nothing could be warmer. Each year more and more things are made of paper. We have had paper cups and plates for a long time. But now we hear that chairs, tables and even beds can be made of paper. With paper boots and shoes, you can wear paper hats, paper dresses and paper raincoats. When you have used them away and buy new ones. People have made paper boats, but they haven't made paper planes or cars. Just wait they perhaps will.	['In 1100']

What was Katherine's problem after a few weeks with the writer?	"One day a family visited the school where I taught deaf children. They said they would move here and planned to send their deaf daughter to my school as a first grader. They were upset that their child's kindergarten teacher told them not to have high hopes for her. Standing behind them was Katherine, a beautiful five-year-old with long hair and dark eyes. The whole time her parents were there, she didn't make a sound or use sign language, even when her parents asked her to do so. After a few weeks with Katherine, I discovered she was a very smart child. Although she joined in different learning activities, writing was always a problem . I tried all kinds of ways to get her interested in writing, but she always refused to write. One day Katherine got off the school bus and stood in front of the school crying. The teachers there did not know enough sign language to ask her what happened. Finally they led her into the office and gave her a pen and a piece of paper. Katherine wrote:""PACBAK"". Then the teachers realized she had left her backpack on the bus. They called the bus driver back to school and soon Katherine got her backpack back. That day _ . From then on she fell in love with writing. She is a young woman now and has become an excellent writer, public speaker and student leader."	"[""She didn't like to write""]"

Why is ice sculpting difficult according to the passage ?	Ice sculpting is a difficult process . First , ice must be carefully selected so that it is suitable for sculpting . Its ideal material is pure , clean water with high clarity . It should also have the minimum(=least) number of air bubbles. Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels. Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used . Ice sculptors also use sharp chisels that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table . For example , in a wedding banquet it is common to see a pair of ice-sculpted swans that represent the union of the new couple .

Why did they choose a small path instead of the main trails?	Last July, my parents and I went to visit my aunt and uncle in Seattle, a city on the northwest American coast. Dad did some research and had no difficulty in finding us cheap tickets online. On the day of our flight, we had to wake up very early. When we checked our bags in, we found that one bag weighed too much, so we had to pay a fine. After that, Dad insisted that we go and have some breakfast at the airport restaurant. We had a lot of fun watching many different people there. Then we realized it was getting late, so we rushed to the gate. It took one hour for everyone to get on the plane, but finally the door was shut and we were on our way! I think my favorite experience during our trip was our visit to Mount Rainier, a volcano near Seattle. It was nothing like I had expected. Before we left, my aunt lent us hats to protect us from getting sunburned, so I supposed that it would be very hot. Imagine my surprise when we drove up the mountain and I discovered the top was covered in snow and ice! My uncle led us to a small path beyond the main trails to increase our chances of seeing wildlife. We walked over a small hill, and suddenly before us there appeared a field of snow. Small wild flowers grew up through the snow; underneath the snow we could hear rushing water -- a small stream. Little animals stood still to avoid being noticed; tiny birds rose into the air. It was the most beautiful sight that I'd ever seen.	['To enjoy more of the wildlife.']
Which of the following could probably best explain the title of the passage?	"Cell Phones Are the New Cigarettes When you get in your car, you reach for it. When you're at work, you take a break to have a moment alone with it. When you get into a lift, you play with it. Cigarettes? Cup of coffee? No, it's the third most addictive thing in modern life, the cell phone. And experts say it is becoming more difficult for many people to curb their wishes to hug it more tightly than most of their personal relationships. With its shiny surface, its smooth and satisfying touch, the cell phone connects us to the world even as it disconnects us from people three feet away. It affects us in ways its inventors in the late 1940s never imagined. Dr. Chris Knippers, an expert at the Betty Ford Center in Southern California, reports that the overuse of cell phones has become a social problem not much different from other harmful addictions: a barrier to one-on-one personal contact, and an escape from reality. Sounds extreme, but we've all witnessed the evidence: the person at a restaurant who talks on the phone through an entire meal, ignoring his kids around the table; the woman who talks on the phone in the car, ignoring her husband; the teen who texts messages all the way home from school, avoiding contact with kids all around him. Is it just rude, or is it a kind of unhealthiness? And pardon me, but how is this improving the quality of life? Jim Williams, an industrial sociologist based in Massachusetts, he points to a study by Duke University researchers that found one-quarter of Americans say they have no one to discuss their most important personal business with. Despite the growing use of phones, e-mail and instant messaging, in other words, Williams says studies show that we don't have as many friends as our parents. ""Just as more information has led to less wisdom, more acquaintances through the Internet and cell phones have produced fewer friends,"" he says. If the cell phone has truly had these effects, it's because it has become very widespread. In 1987, there were only 1 million cell phones in use. Today, almost 300 million Americans carry them. The number of cell phones is far more than that of wired phones in the United States."	['Cell phones have become as addictive as cigarettes.']

Who are responsible for EarthKAM?	"While only about 200 astronauts have had the excitement of looking down at Earth and commanding systems on the International Space Station, actually thousands of everyday middleschool students have experienced by Middle School Students, or EarthKAM, a camera system. EarthKAM is an educational activity and outreach investigation that also results in remote Earth sensing and observation. Using the Internet, the students control a special digital camera fixed aboard the space station, enabling them to photograph the Earth's coastlines, mountain ranges and other geographic items of interest from the unique advantage point of space. While EarthKAM offers a powerful way for students to investigate Earth from the unique perspective of space, it is also inspiring the next generation of flight controllers for space programs--involving university students to control and operate the camera system and related activities from the ground. In the interview, Brion Au, one of the investigation developers at NASA's Johnson Space Centre, said,""EarthKAM is a payload by students, for students. They are in charge. This system provides a viewpoint that the astronauts have...it's just aweinspiring!""So far, students have captured more than 40,000 photos of the Earth from the space station as it orbited the Earth once every 90 minutes, traveling at 17,500 miles an hour. The team at EarthKAM posts these photographs online for the public and participating classrooms around the world to view. Au explains that this education investigation is inspiring students to explore the world by examining Earth, while promoting social studies, art, geography, science, technology, and math, among other important lessons involving research and teamwork. EarthKAM was started by Dr. Sally Ride, originally flying on the shuttles. The camera is located in the window Observational Research Facility, also known as the WORF, one of many the station's research facilities."	['The students.']

Should I bring a present, such as sweets or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late? At the dinner table, how can I know which fork or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness? Wang Lin Letter B Dear Wang Lin, It's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine if you know that your friends drink it. You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them. Try to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you. If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after. Rose	['some flowers']

How did the two young people feel when the author pressed the button?	"My grandmother seems to be wrong when she says that good manners will never go out of style. Several days ago, I tried entering a lift with one of my arms fixed in a bandage while carrying a computer bag in the other. Not being fast enough, I was passed by two young people who managed to get into the lift before me. The lift door closed only after I entered. Having already pressed their wanted floor button, the young people waited impatiently for me to press the button for where I was going. If they had decided to help, we could have moved much faster. But they had not. So I did my best and pressed the button with my arm. The two young people looked very angry with me. I was losing heart. The memory of this incident has stayed with me because it followed shortly after my building's watchman refused to help me carry a heavy box full of books. His answer was that he could not carry the books a few meters because it was not his job. However, I remembered myself helping people for so many years carrying boxes, shopping bags, or pushing wheelchairs upon the request of a stranger in need or when my conscience called on me. ""Oh, this young generation, they have no manners, ""my grandmother would say. The idea of good manners refers to the considering of other people's feelings. We need more and more people to have good manners. Good manners should be-come part of our lives."	['Angry.']
From the text, what can we know about the janitor?	"Sometimes, kindness is a simple answer in a difficult and challenging world. When my granddaughter, Skylar, was young, one day we went out and had a contest called ""Who can make the most people smile. "" And we continue it today. When shopping, we were walking in the supermarket and noticed someone walking down the aisle with her head down. Skylar walked up to her and gave her a big smile. I watched her walk down the aisle, turned around and smiled at Skylar again or perhaps smiled at someone else. Kindness is a chain that pulls us all together. Every single act of kindness has a ripple effect . In 2002, my dad had a series of strokes and other illness. My dad had been doing nice things for all sorts of people for years, from the street crossing guard, to the waitress in a restaurant, to a friend's mother. That same day, I made cookies for the janitor at the post office. When I gave him the cookies he actually looked a little embarrassed. ""Why, Linda?"" he asked. ""Because I appreciate you!"" I answered. ""When I get here at 6 am and it is still dark out and it is a little scary, I know you are inside and I feel safe. And when I first moved here and my post office box was always empty, you always cheered me on. And you always keep this place clean."" That evening his wife called me and said that he was overwhelmed . ""No one even knows his name, let alone bakes him cookies!"" she said. (278 words)"	['He was kind and grateful.']
It's better to write a poem with rhymes because _ .	"Mother's Day is the time you say ""thank you"" to your mom. Stop shopping at the store. Flowers and other things in stores are too common to mention. You can choose a special gift for Mother's Day! Just try staying close to home--and heart --write a Mother's Day poem for her. Use your head. Think of special moments when you were a child, times you've shared with your mom, things she did for you, and why you love her. Write down how those moments influenced you. Write down everything you can think of. This is your inspiration for the poem. Look at what you wrote and pick out those things that are connected . See if any words rhyme . It's fine to write a free poem(one without rhymes), but many people find poems with rhymes are easier to work with, easier to read and quite catchy . If no words rhyme but you want your poem to, try to find connecting words that can help connect memories. Once you have a few sentences, put them in a good order. For example, you could start with a childhood memory and end with something you remember from last month. Add a title that shows the feeling of the poem. Even something as simple as ""For Mom"" can work, although something more personal might be better. Write it in pen if you have beautiful handwriting. Read the poem over breakfast on Mother's Day, and then hand it to your mom. Let's wait and see the smile and tears of happiness on her face."	['it is easier to read and remember']

I've learned some spoken language,but Thai writing is very difficult.The cooking lesson is my favourite.I'm learning all about Thai food and culture People don't use chopsticks here,but spoons and forks.When I come back,I'm going to cook you a real Thai meal. Last weekend we visited some temples.We also drove to Pattaya beach near Bangkok.I thought it was great,but Sanan and Chinda say that next month they're taking me to Phuket Island,where the beaches are even more beautiful.The month after next,we're going to travel to Mr.Phairat,s hometown in the north of Thailand.The Phairats own land there,and they have two elephants.I'm going to ride those elephants -- and even wash them.Sanan and Chinda say it's really fun.

I'll tell you all about my Thai boxing lessons next time I write. Love, Mandy	['6.']
"It can be inferred from the underline words ""delightfully shocked"" that ."	"In a nation with a one-child family planning policy, it's understandable for parents to worry over whether they are petting their children. Are the children truly as fragile as sometimes made out to be? The concern has been brought into focus with the popularity of a hit reality TV series, Hunan TV's Dad! Where Are We Going? and Zhejiang TV's First Time In Life. In both, children as young as three have become new public figures. In the show First Time In Life, children chosen from ordinary families are given small tasks to complete by themselves;the ongoing Dad! show centers on five celebrity fathers and their children who are forced to live a simple life in rural areas, far outside their comfort zone. Regardless of their family background, the children's reactions to new environments have struck the public. In one episode of Dad! , the five-year-old daughter of former Olympic diving champion Tian Liang cries and hides behind her father when they arrive at a rural village. In an episode of the other series, a young girl in Tianjin breaks down into a tearful fit after being asked by her father to go out alone to buy eggs and a pancake. In the eyes of some observers, these kids show no sense of independence, and the reason is put down to parents who are overly sheltering. But television viewers and parents were heartened when the sobbing Tianjin girl finally wiped away her tears as she returned holding the pancake. In the case of Tian's daughter, she eventually began to take care of her younger companions and learned to seek help from people she didn't know. The father of the Tianjin girl felt ""delightfully shocked"" and said. ""She used to have to be accompanied by her mother or grandmother. Now she has the courage to do it all by herself. "" The shows have led many parents to change how they raise their children. Shanghai mother Liang Jing said she would try to ""give some training"" to her shy son, asking him to tidy up his toys. Lin Yi, a parenting expert in Beijing, said giving kids a chance to do things for themselves helps to raise their sense of achievement, which carries benefits throughout their lives.

Which of the following is the most effective in building abdominal muscles?	"We've all seen them: perfectly toned famous people on late-night television telling us that we too can develop rock-hard abdominal muscles . It's easy! Just pay $149.99 for the Torso Track or $149.75 for the Ad-Doer and watch those unwanted inches leave your waist. Americans spend tens of millions of dollars on various products to firm up their fat around the waist. And did they work? Not necessarily. Independent studies have concluded that most of these products -- no matter who approved them or how expensive they are -- shape your midsection no better than old-fashioned stomach crunches . Some can even cause injury -- like the $518.99 Body Shaper-Q8SP, which left electrical burns on some researchers at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. Others, like the popular Ab-Doer, typically burn less energy than a gentle walk, according to a study to be published in September by the American Council on Exercise. The fact is that many Americans don't have the biological makeup to develop an obvious abdominal muscles. They are either unable to get the necessary muscle mass or they can't lose enough fat to make a difference. Even if the underlying muscles are well developed, all it takes to hide it is one-sixteenth of an inch of fat. That's enough to exclude most healthy women as well as plenty of guys who do crunches every day. So what works best? In its new study, the exercise experts researched on the results of the popular Ab-Doer. A lengthy TV advertisement promises that just 10 minutes a day performing such movements as ""Body Boogies"" and ""Good Mornings"" will ""help form those muscles the fun and easy way without diets."" Steven Loy, professor at California State University, Northridge, tested the promise by measuring the electrical activity produced by the abdominal muscles during three Ab-Doer movements. He and his colleagues then compared the results with those produced during traditional exercises. They determined that the muscles were no more active, and in some cases less so, when exercisers were using the Ab-Doer. Taking a broader approach, researchers at San Diego State University compared 13 abdominal exercises for their ability to develop the central abdominal muscles. They concluded, in a report published in May, that the most effective exercises kept turning the body and worked the muscles the entire time. Among the winners: the bicycle movements -- so called because it looks as if you are riding a bike while lying flat on the floor -- and exercises performed on the ""Captain's Chair"", a product typically found in gyms that helps hold the body in the air while you raise your legs up toward your chest. Researchers suggested that a varied routine of the different exercises could deliver the best results."	"[""Captain's Chair.""]"
What did the author learn from her experience?	"It was the Year from Hell - the dog died, my marriage of 24 years ended, and my house burned down. I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house. My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, ""Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son."" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years. We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, ""Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!"" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed. It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail. I'm also grateful for the lessons I learned from the fire and the other losses that came so suddenly, so fast. Much to my surprise, I found gratitude among the ashes. I was tested serious trial by fire. But, like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes strong and whole. I would not be the person I am today if not for that Year from Hell."

Which of the following statement is RIGHT?	If you go into the forest with friends, stay with them. If you don't, you may get lost. Sit down and stay where you are. Don't try to find your friends, but let them find you instead . You can help them find you by staying in one place. There is another way to help your friends or other people to find you. You can shout or whistle three times. Stop for a while. Then shout or whistle three times again. Any signal given three times is a help. Keep up shouting or whistling. Always three times together. When people hear you, they will know that you are not just making a noise for fun. They will let you know that they have heard your signal. They will give you two shouts or two whistles. When a signal is given twice, it is an answer to a call for help. If you don't think that you will get help before night comes, try to make a little house with branches . Make yourself a bed with leaves and grass. When you need some water, you have to leave your little branch house to look for it. Don't just walk away. _ When you are lost, the most important thing to do is stay in one place.	['If you leave branches to look for water, you can find your way back easily.']
The passage mainly gives us _ .	Relation between the United States and Columbia suffered for many years because of an incident involving the Republic of Panama. By the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, many Americans felt that an easier and faster way was needed to get ships from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Some people in the United States first believed that a canal across Nicaragua was the answer. However, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that a canal through Panama would be a better choice. In order to build the canal , the United States had to negotiate a treaty with Columbia , which at that time controlled Panama . Roosevelt offered Columbia $ 10 million plus $ 250,000 a year for 99 years for a six-mile-wide strip of land across Panama. Columbia rejected the United States' offer. This ranged President Roosevelt, and negotiations with Columbia ended. In 1903, a revolution broke out in Panama. The United States ships were sent by President Roosevelt to protect the Panamanian revolutionaries from Columbian forces. The revolution succeeded, and Panama declared its independence from Columbia. The United States then negotiated with the newly formed government. A treaty was signed, and the United States began building the canal. As a result of the incident, Columbia and the United States remained on bad terms for many years. Not until 1921, when the United States agreed to pay Columbia some compensation for its territory, did relations between the two countries improve.	['information']
Which of the following made the author's family choose to kill the cat in a painless way?	DEAR AMY: We recently had to put our cat down. It came _ . We had no idea that he had health problems, and we woke up early one morning to the cat crying out painfully. We immediately rushed him to the vet's where the vet said that at best treatment might lengthen his life by two to three months. We did not want to see him suffer, so we chose to kill the cat in a painless way. I am having a rough time! I cry when I am alone. I cry when I see pet commercials on television. I put away everything that reminds me of the cat. But the last sight of seeing the cat in pain plays over and over in my head. My kids seem alright with what has happened, but why am I struggling? It has only been one week since his passing, so I hope things will get better. Do you have any suggestions? Yours, Sad DEAR SAD: There is no loss quite like the loss of a pet; these animals keep us company through important life passages and are beloved witnesses to our human lives. I understand your instinct to put away all of your cat's things, but it may help you now to memorialize your pet by using these things. Each family member can write down favorite things about him or memories of him; read their memories aloud and put the papers inside his bowl. The idea is to replace those painful last memories with much more lively memories taking place over the most of the animal's life. Time will then do its job, which is to affect your feelings. And then, when you're ready, I hope you will adopt another animal and give it the opportunity to[:Z-X-X-K]share your life. Yours, Amy	"[""The family wouldn't see it suffer in its later life.""]"

The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: "" Are you standing or sitting?"" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... ""So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground. In such a critical state as he was then, his thought still went to me..."" The old lady concluded slowly, ""That's the sweetest whisper of love I've ever heard all my life."" A loud applause followed in the wake of a short silence."

Why did E.T. end up one worst video game ever?	Worst Game Ever? E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a video game that came out for the Atari 2600 game system in 1982. It was based on a very popular film of the same name. Star programmer Howard Warshaw created it with consultation from the film director Steven Spielberg. It was July 27th, 1982. Howard Warshaw was hot off the success of his most recent game, Raiders of the Lost Ark. He received a call from Atari C.E.O, Ray Kassar. Atari had bought the rights to make a video game version of Spilberg's Movie, E.T., which had just been released in June. Kassar told Warshaw that Spielberg had specifically asked for Warshaw to make the game Warshaw was honored, but there was one huge problem. Atari needed the game finished by September 1stin order to start selling it during the Christmas season. It had taken Warshaw six months to create Raiders of the Lost Ark. The game he made prior to that took him seven months. He was expected to create E.T. in around five weeks. Warshaw accepted the challenge anyway and production began. Spielberg wanted Warshaw to create a simple maze game similar to Pac-man, but V had a bigger vision. He wanted players to explore different environments in 3D world. Usually companies like Atari have people test games before releasing them, but they decided to skip testing due to time limitations. The game was a hot holiday item at first. Unfortunately, Atari overestimated how many they would sell. They made 5 million copies and they only sold 1.5 million. Most people who played the game hated it. The graphics were bad. Game play was awkward. Players got stuck in holes that they couldn't escape. Some people who stuck with the game grew to like it, but it wasn't the mainstream success that Atari had hoped it would be. Too many copies of the game sat on store shelves. One employee remembers the game being discounted five times, from $49.95 to less than a dollar. A newspaper in New Mexico reported that between 10 and 20 semitrailer truckloads of Atari products were crushed and buried at landfill in Alamogordo. Atari lost over $100 million on E.T.. The game was so bad that it was said to have affected Atari's reputation. The video game industry soon fell into a deep depression, with a profit $3.2 billion in 1983 to just over $100 million in 1985, almost a 97% drop. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial will long be remembered as one of the worst games ever made, if not one of the causes of the decline of entire video game industry.	['It was produced in a hurry.']
Whose search skill is the easiest of all?	"A company advertised in the newspaper for a sales position. Details of the prerequisite , salary and benefits were given. It was also clearly stated that applicants needed to take an aptitude test and an interview. However, looking at the whole advertisement, one could not find any contact information of the company. Most interested applicants thought that it was the company's HR department's carelessness or a printing error. They therefore waited patiently for the newspaper to publish an amendment. But instead of waiting for the newspaper to publish the company details, another three applicants took the initiative to find out the company's contact information themselves. Tim did a search on the Internet. By typing the company's name, he easily obtained all the information including its contact number. Lisa called up the local telephone number search service and found out the company's office number. She called up the office and got the required contact information. Donna put in a greater effort in her search. She remembered seeing a poster by the same company in the city so she drove all the way down and made a few rounds to search for it. She finally found it together with the company's contact information. Three days after that advertisement was published in the newspaper, most interested applicants were still waiting eagerly for an amendment. On the other hand, the application letters and resumes of Tim, Lisa and Donna had already reached the hands of the company's HR manager. They were then called up for an interview. During the interview, all went well and immediately they were hired. The three of them were a little surprised at how fast things went on. They were expecting for an aptitude test as stated in the advertisement. The HR director answered them, smiling, ""Our test is hidden in the advertisement itself. To be a good salesperson in this age, he or she has to be broad-minded and very importantly, does not follow rigid steps or rules. You are all clever and agile. In a short time, you've managed to find ways of contacting us. It shows clearly that you have passed the test with flying colors!""

Most likely, Amelia began to take flight lesson at the age of _ .	"Amelia Earharl was born on July 24,1897 in Atchison, Kansas at her grandparent's house. Soon after her birth, Amelia's parents separated. The girl lived with her grandparents until she was 10. In 1917, Amelia entered a nursing school and witnessed the horrors of war. She served as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse at a military hospital until Novermber,1981,. She later said,""There for the first time I realized what the World War meant... I saw only men without arms or legs..."". In 1920, Amelia's parents had reunited in California. Amelia decided to leave Columbia and join them. Amelia's love for flying was born when her father took her to an aerial show, in which she got to ride in a flight over Los Angeles. Amelia started taking flight lessons with Anita Snook at Kinner Field near Long Beach, California. Amelia _ quickly and soon became an excellent pilot. In July of 1920, she purchased her first plane. She named it ""The Canary"". In October of 1922, just a few years after taking up flying, Amelia began attempting to break records. She first broke the height record of 14,000 feet. In 1925, Amelia took a position at Dension House in Boston as a social worker. While there, Amelia got a call that would change her life forever. On April 27th, 1926, Captain Hill Railey called Amelia to take part in a flight across the Atlantic Ocean. She would only be a passenger. Wilmer Stultz and Louis Gorden flew the plane, but Amelia became the first woman to make the trip across the Atlantic. Amelia didn't think she deserved the attention she received but was more determined than ever to make the trip herself. While in London, and back in the United States, Amelia toured the country, giving lectures and speeches."	['23']
From the passage, we learn that _ .	"More than 50,000,000 people live in the rainforests of the world and most of them do not hurt the forest they live in. They eat the fruits that grow on the forest trees, but they do not cut them down. They kill some animals to eat, but they do not destroy them. When we cut down the rainforests, we destroy these forest people, too. In 1900, there were 1,000,000 forest people in the Amazon forest. In 1980, there were only 200,000. The Yanomami live along the rivers of the rainforest in the north of Brazil. They have lived in the rainforest for about 10,000 years and they use more than 2,000 different plants for food and for medicine. But in 1988, someone found gold in their forest, and suddenly 45,000 people came to the forest and began looking for gold. They cut down the forest to make roads. They made more than a hundred airports. The Yanomami people lost land and food. Many died because new diseases came to the forest with the strangers. The Yanomami people tried to save their forest, because it was their home. But the people who wanted gold were stronger. Many forest people try to save their forests. Chico Mendes was famous in Brazil because he wanted to keep the forest for his people. ""I want the Amazon forest to help all of us-forest people Brazil, and all the Earth,"" he said. A few months later, in December 1988, people who wanted to cut down the forest killed Chico Mendes. In Borneo, people were cutting down the forest of the Penan people to sell the wood. The Penan people tried to save their rainforest. They made _ across the roads into the forest. In 1987, they closed fifteen roads for eight months. No one cut down any trees during that time. In Panama, the Kuna people saved their forest. They made a forest park which tourists pay to visit. The Gavioes people of Brazil use the forest, but they protect it as well. They find and sell the Brazil nuts which grow on the forest trees."	['the rainforest people have done something to protect their home']
Why does warm water freeze first in the same freezing weather?	Warm water freezes more quickly than cold water. Sir Francis Bacon said that almost four hundred years ago. But few people believed him until 1970. In that year a Canadian scientist George Kill proved the English professor was right. Dr Kill filled an open oil pail with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He put both in the same low temperature. The warm water froze first. The lack of covers on the pails is the secret. Some of the warm water changed into vapor. This meant that less of the warm water was left to be frozen. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water even though it had a greater temperature drop to make.	['Because some of the warm water turns to vapor, the amount  becomes less than that of cold water.']
If you want to see wildlife on foot, you should go to _ .	There are hundreds of national parks and wildlife areas in Africa that you can travel to. Here are the top four travel destinations in Africa: Tanzania----Serengeti National Park During the annual migration , when the wildebeests and zebras pack up and leave their living areas to find fresher ones, the Serengeti is an astonishing place to be. It's a very good travel spot in Africa at other times of the year too, but the migration has been ranked by many as one of the wonders of the natural world. Kenya----Masai Mara National Park If you want to see the big cats, this wildlife park is the best of the best. Lion, leopard and cheetah abound and they are relatively easy to spot because of the grassland vegetation which means you get good views for miles around. Another big plus is the fact that going off road is allowed and it is a big advantage because the animals will rarely oblige you and stay next to the major roads. South Africa-Kruger National Park For the variety of species no other places in Africa can come close to the Kruger Park. And because it is so large it has a number of different ecosystems that you can pass through in your search for animals and birds. It is one of the best managed parks in Africa and the accommodation is well-equipped, too. Zambia-South Luangwa National Park South Luangwa is a diamond in the rough, just waiting for enough exposure to bring it to its rightful place in the crown of prime Africa trips. It has been regarded as one of the best places in Africa to see the special leopard and it is the birthplace of the walking travel.	['South Luangwa National Park.']
What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ?	A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear . The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went .

I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen . If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered . I could not remain indifferent to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others . I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying . Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer .

Who turned Australia into a colony?	Australia, the last continent, was discovered by ships belonging to some European nations in the seventeenth century. These nations were less interested in changing it into a colony than in exploring it. As in the early history of the United States, it was the English who set up the settlements in Australia. This history and the geography of these two British colonies have some other things in common as well. Australia and the United States are about the same in size, and their western lands are both not rich in soil. It was the eastern coast of Australia and American that the English first settled, and both colonies soon began to develop towards the west. However, this westward movement took place more because the English were searching for better land than because the population was increasing. Settlements of the western part of both countries developed quickly after gold was discovered in America in 1849 and in Australia two years later. Although the development of these two countries has a lot in common, there are some striking differences as well. The United States gained its independence from England by revolution while Australis won its independence without having to go to war. Australia, unlike the United States, was firstly truned into a colony by English prisoners and its economic development was in wheat growing and sheep raising. By 1922, for example, Australia had fifteen times more sheep than it had people, or almost half as many sheep as there are people today in the United States. Yet, in spite of these and other main differences, Australia and the United States have more in common with each other than either one has with most of the rest of the world.	['Britain.']
We can infer that the writer wrote this passage mainly to _ .	Energy goes from one plant or animal to another. A food chain shows how this energy moves. Each time an animal gets eaten, its energy is passed onto the animal that eats it. The food chain is very important because it keeps the balance of nature. If one part of the food chain disappears, it can affect all the other plants and animals. Any threat to the food chain is a threat to the environment's biodiversit . The food chain helps keep animal populations in balance. However, if something happens to increase or decrease one of the links in the food chain, that balance is broken. If one animal becomes endangered, it puts all the animals above it at risk. Some of the threats are natural, such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornados, floods and so on. But the biggest threats to the food chain come from you and me. These threats include overhunting, overfishing, logging, farming, development, pollution, etc. The food chain is endangered anywhere humans have had an effect on the natural environment. A recent study shows that the overfishing of large sharks is damaging the food chain along the US Atlantic coast. Canadian and American scientists say sharks are being killed in great numbers for their meat and fins . Now, not enough sharks are around to eat the cownose ray. The ray's population has increased and they have eaten up the shellfish to the point where it has hurt commercial fishing. Many of us disturb the natural environment in our own backyards. It's up to us to take care of the environment and try not to disrupt the natural food chain. If we don't act responsibly, animals will start disappearing.

"Thomas Wensma's attitude to the ""planned obsolescence"" is _ ."	"Why are we addicted to upgrades? According to Donald Norman, American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things, ""planned obsolescence"" is the trick behind the upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry. The New York Times cited Norman last month, saying that electronics manufactures strategically release new upgrades periodically, both for hardware and software, so that customers on every level feel the need to buy the newest version. ""This is an old-time trick- they're not inventing anything new,"" he said. Thomas Wensma, a Dutch designer, despises the ""planned obsolescence"" of companies, as recently reported by UK-based The Guardian. Wensma said this is a wasteful system through which companies - many of them producing personal electronics - release shoddy products simply because ""they know that, in six months or a year, they'll put out a new one"". But the new psychology of consumers is part of this system, as Wensma said to the newspaper: ""We now want something new, something pretty, the next shiny thing."" _ ""It's to the damage of the consumer and the environment,"" as the New York Times quoted Norman. ""But perhaps to the betterment of the stockholder."" In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's profit margin was more than 21 percent, reported the Los Angeles Times. At Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest PC manufacturer, it was only 7 percent. ""Steven Jobs pushed the principle of 'planned obsolescence' to new heights,"" the newspaper commented on the company's profits and marketing strategy. ""Apple's annual upgrades of its products generate sales of millions of units as owners of one year's MacBook or iPhone line up to buy the newest version, even when the changes are incremental."" Peer pressure As to Li Jijia, the need for upgrading his smart phone comes mainly from friends and classmates. When the majority of friends are switching to the latest devices, he worries about feeling left out. ""Some apps and games require better hardware to run,"" said Li. ""If you don't join in, you lose part of the connection to your friends."""	['negative']
According to the passage, we can infer _ .	Flight cancellations and loss of luggage can ruin even the best-planned holiday. The key to a stress-free trip is having a backup plan. Fly non-stop. The worst problems involve connections, so it is important to take non-stop flights whenever possible. If you do have to make a connection, try to route through a southern city, where snowstorms and de-icing delays will be less likely. Always allow at least two to three hours for flight connections. Check the weather. Check the weather in your connecting city, not just the arrival and departure city. If your departure flight is cancelled because of weather, you can go home or back to your hotel. Airlines promise to get you on the next available flight, not the next flight. That could be several days later on a sold-out holiday weekend. Go early. The earlier in the day you fly, the better your chance of getting rebooked the same day after a missed connection. It will also put you ahead of stranded passengers who arrive later. Rebook immediately. As soon as your flight is delayed or cancelled, get on the phone and rebook your flight instead of waiting at the ticket counter. If your rebooking is delayed, call or ask your travel agent to find a seat on another carrier, and then ask your original carrier to endorse your ticket to the new airline. Airlines are not required to do this but often do. Learn more at www. dot. gov/ airconsumer/ fly-rights. Ship bags. A few days before your flight, ship suitcases or holiday gifts to your destination by a documented express service. It's preferable to losing bags because of re-routed flights and sometimes cheaper than paying airline overweight bag fees. Know your rights. Airlines are not required to passengers for delayed or cancelled flights, but it never hurts to ask for goodwill vouchers for meals, taxis or a room.	['you will pay more for your overweight luggage']
Watt wanted to find a way _ .	The horsepower was first used two hundred years ago. James Watt had made the world's first widely used steam engine. He had no way of telling people exactly how powerful it was, for at that time there were no units for measuring power. Watt decided to find out how much work one strong horse could do in one minute. He called that init one horsepower. With this unit he could measure the work his steam engine could do. He discovered that a horse could lift a 3,300-pound weight 10 feet into the air in one minute. His engine could lift a 3,300 pound weight 100 feet in one minute. Because his engine did ten times as much work as the horse, Watt called it a ten-horsepower engine.

We know from the passage that Safia _ .	"Once upon a time there lived the daughter of a king. Her name was Safia. Her father and mother loved her very much, and would deny her nothing in the world. One day, a magician came to the palace and asked for sanctuary , saying that he was a professor who was being persecuted by his enemies and had nowhere to write an important book. ""Good professor,"" said the king, ""you shall have a room and everything that you desire, on condition that you may finish your great work."" So the magician went on with his spells and magic formulas, pretending to be absorbed in scholarly matters. Every Friday, which was the day of rest in that far land, the magician paid his respects to the king and his court, but secretly he desired to take away the king's throne. One day he disguised himself as an old woman and walked under the trees in the palace gardens till he met Safia. ""Princess,"" he said, ""let me be your laundress, for I can wash linens and silks as finely as anyone in the world, and I would do it for almost nothing if I could serve Your Highness."" ""Good woman,"" said Princess Safia, ""I can see that you are a poor creature and grieve for your condition. Come to my private quarters and I shall give you some of my linen to wash."" So the disguised magician followed the princess into the palace, and before the girl could see what was happening he bundled her into a laundry bag and ran away as fast as his legs would carry him. He took the princess into his private room. Muttering a magic spell, he made her as small as a doll, and put her in a cupboard. The next Friday he went to the court as usual, and found the whole palace _ ""Princess Safia has vanished, and His Majesty is nearly out of his mind. All the soothsayers have tried to find out through their magical powers where she can be, but none of them have managed it,"" said the Grand Vizier. The wicked magician smiled, for he knew that his spell was so strong that it would defy all the soothsayers in the land until the day of his death."	"[""didn't refuse the old woman's request""]"
We can learn from the passage that ASIMO _ .	"The lights dimmed,the musical hall grew quiet and out walked the conductor shiny and white and 4 feet and 3 inches tall. ASIMO, a robot designed by Honda Motor Co., met its latest challenge Tuesday evening: Conducting the Detroit Symphony , in a performance of ""The Impossible Dream"" from ""Man of La Mancha"". ""Hello, everyone,"" ASIMO said to the audience in a childlike voice, then waved to the orchestra. As it conducted, it perfectly mimicked the actions of a conductor, nodding its head at various sections and gesturing with one or both hands. ASIMO took a final bow to excited shouts from the audience. Later, cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined ASIMO onstage to receive an award for his efforts in music education. Honda spokeswoman Alicia Jones says it is the first time ASIMO has conducted an orchestra, and it may be the first time any robot has conducted a live performance. But ASIMO has its limits. ASIMO's engineers programmed the robot to mimic Charles Burke, the Detroit Symphony's education director, as he conducted the piece in front of a pianist about six months ago. But it can't respond to the musicians. ""It's not a communicative device. It simply is programmed to do a set of gestures,"" said Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra's musical director. ""If the orchestra decides to go faster, there's nothing the robot can do about it. Hopefully, I keep that under control."" But several musicians also said ASIMO was more realistic than they expected. ""The movements are still a little stiff , but very humanlike, much better than I thought,"" Hutchinson said."

Accroding to the passage, the prosperity of Tula _ .	"The Toltec---as they were now called ---began to know great abundance and enjoy the generous gifts of the land, as had been foretold by Quetzalcoatl. ""He has great powers.He has made us rich.We have not known hunger since he arrived.Where he places his eyes and hands,everything is abundance and beauty."" They were happy, they were proud. At that time they all still worked at the jobs Quetzalcoatl assigned to them. Tula grew. People came from far away to admire its growth. Many asked permission to settle down and enjoy its abundance,which was distributed according to the needs of the people. Topiltzin was in charge of distributing the riches,under the orders of Quetzalcoatl, so that no one would want. They were all content because they all had more than they had ever had. Many worked.They were busy all day. Quetzalcoatl had spent six years among the Toltecs. The house for the heart of the people was almost finished and the granaries full when he decided. ""There is prosperity and abundance in all the land.Let us extend it beyond the mountains.We shall go to the land of the Chichimecs.It is time to take my mission to them. I shall make them better,I shall make them live together,I shall gather them in towns,I shall teach them to till the land and to build their homes."" ""Let us leave them in their land as they are now ,""Topiltzin argued,""They are savages ;their life is violent and disorderly.They move freely,like the wind in the mountains and the plains,with nothing to keep them.Leave them where they are.There is much that we must do in our own land. ""I do not belong to this land alone.They are all my brothers,I am to give all of them, I shall look for them. I shall take the gods of Tula to them,""Quetzalcoatl said. ""Think carefully about what we shall do.You do not know them.They do not understand words. They are like savage animals,like jaguars,"" Topiltzin insisted. ""I shall go,""said Quetzalcoatl.""My life must be accomplished.This time you will not accompany me because you do not have the will to go.I shall leave soon with some of my followers."" ""Do not go with so few people! I shall accompany you with skillful warriors who are used to killing Chichimecs and avoiding their traps."" Topiltzin insisted. ""I am not going there with violence. I shall go to them as I came here,to take them the gifts of life and the doctrine of sin and redemption ."" ""You have not spoken of sin and redemption for a long time,"" Tattle remarked. He had been listening attentively to the dialogue,and was then close to seventeen years of age.""You have not come near the Tree you planted in the square in a long time.The Tree has no shoots,it has not grown,it looks sad and lonely."" ""During this time,Tattle,I have often thought of it.There was confusion in my spirit.Now the Tree orders me to spread good in other lands,to make other brothers happy. It will soon have shoots."""

Bollywood movies are cheap to make because _	"Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called ""Bollywood"". Each year, Bollywood makes twice as many movies as Hollywood. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, adventure, mystery and romance. Because Bollywood films has so many different characters, this style of film is called a ""masala"" film. Masala is an Indian word for a mixture of spices . Another big difference is the way the movies are made. It takes longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the filming is being made. Sometimes they even write the script by hand instead of typing it. Bollywood actors are so popular that some of them may even work on several movies at the same time. They may even make several different films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps to keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies."	['some movie reuses things from other movies.']
What is the main idea of the passage?	"Recently, a study showed that changes found in astronauts' eye tissue might cause vision problems, and possibly even blindness. As well as threatening the health of astronauts, this could influence long-distance missions into space. Larry Kramer of Texas Medical School in Houston and his colleagues carried out MRI scans on 27 NASA astronauts after they had spent an average of 108 days in space. About half of them had some problems in their optic nerve or eyeball. The changes match those seen in people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a rare condition in which the pressure of blood is abnormally high in the brain. People with the condition experience headaches, nausea and vision problems including blindness. In space, the changes are probably caused by living in free fall. ""It is not because of the sunlight in space or the spacecraft's function,"" says Kramer. ""One likely reason is that blood which normally pools in the legs is shifted toward the skull , raising pressure."" The findings are similar to the results of a survey of 300 astronauts carried out in 2011. The damage in vision was reported by 29 percent of astronauts on short-term missions, and 60 percent on long-term missions. ""If astronauts are exhibiting these changes after only 100 days in space, what will happen on a three-year flight to Mars?"" asks Jason Kring, who studies human performance in extreme conditions at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. ""Deteriorating vision could seriously damage astronauts' ability to carry out routine mission tasks, including monitoring displays and navigating the rocky landscape of Mars,"" says Kring. ""This possibility, combined with what we already know about how micro-gravity affects muscles and bones, paints a dark future for human space flight unless we start to develop effective measures."" Kramer says that NASA has the matter in hand. In the wake of the study, all astronauts now have regular brain scans. This includes those yet to travel into space, providing a baseline from which any changes would be obvious. He also believes it might be possible to identify astronauts' risk of eyesight damage from medical data before sending them into space."	"[""Space flight may be bad for astronauts' eyes.""]"
"What does the writer mean by saying ""However,convenience call be a crutch""?"	"Facebook means never having to say goodbye. The social media web site has earned a reputation for reconnecting old friends. Last week,a guy whom I hadn't seen since my bachelor party five years ago sent me a friend request. I accepted and waited for ""Easy E"" to send me a greeting of some kind. He had sought me out,after all. I learned from his profile that he was in a relationship and had a son. However,I'm pretty sure we won't ever write wall--to--wall,let alone e--mail each other. But he'll remain a friend of online until one of us makes a point of removing the other from his official list.

If I spent some time uploading old e--mail addresses,I'm confident that I could increase my friend count actually. A person could make a mission out of reconnecting with childhood friends,former classmates,distant cousins, and those one would like to get to know better. And some people can even handle hundreds of on--screen relationships,keeping up with the daily happenings of their small army of companions. After all,there are worse fates than having too many friends. Thanks to e--mail,the inability to schedule face--to--face meetings no longer means a friendship must come to a close. But even with e--mail,people will lose touch if one or both parties stop writing back. That's normal. People move from school to school,job to job,city to city.

Cats and dogs drop from the sky because _ .	"Have you ever heard anyone say ""It's raining cats and dogs""? It means ""It's raining hard!"" But sometimes cats and dogs do drop from the sky!

Why didn't Martha's parents approve of her desire to dance at first?	"Martha Graham, born in 1894, was one of the most famous dancers and creators of dance, whose influence on dance has been compared with the influence Picasso had on the modern visual arts, Stravinsky had on music, or Frank Lloyd Wright had on architecture. She created almost two hundred dance pieces. She is often called the Mother of Modern Dance. Earlier in her life, however, Martha did not know that she would become a dancer. At that time, the dancers were looked down on. So Martha's parents didn't approve of her desire to dance at the beginning. Until 1916, she began her studies at the newly created Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts, founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, where Graham worked very hard to improve her ability to dance because she was considered too old to begin dancing. In 1936, Graham made her defining work, ""Chronicle^, which signaled the beginning of a new era in modern dance. The dance brought serious issues to the stage for the general public in a dramatic manner. Influenced by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression that followed, and the Spanish Civil War, it focused on depression and isolation, reflected in the dark nature of both the set and costumes. Graham continued to dance past the age of seventy. Once again, she was met with criticism from people who came to watch her shows. But she didn't give up. Her last completed ballet was 1990's Maple Leaf Rag. ""A Dancer's World"" is an introduction to Graham and her work. She tells about her dances and her dance group shows some of their methods. Martha Graham received many awards during her lifetime, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in nineteen seventy-six. She was the -first dancer to receive the country's highest civilian honor. She died in 1991 at the age of ninety-six. In 1998, Time magazine listed her as the ""Dancer of the Century"" and as one of the most important people of the twentieth century."

The idea of making a wetsuit for Pierre came from _ .	"Pierre is a 25-year-old penguin at the California Academy of Sciences.Due to his old age,he was going bald,which made him feel too cold to swim in the pool.Therefore,biologists at the academy had a wetsuit created for this penguin to help him get back in the swimming pool. Unlike marine mammals,which have a layer of blubber to keep them warm,penguins depend on their waterproof feathers.Without them,Pierre was unwilling to jump into the swimming pool and ended up trembling on the side of the pool while his 19 peers played in the water. ""He was cold:he would shake,""said Pam Schaller,a senior biologist.Schaller first tried a heat lamp to keep Pierre warm.Then she got another idea:if wetsuits keep humans warm in the cold Pacific,why not make one for Pierre? Schaller designed the suit,which covered Pierre's body and had small openings for his flippers. ""I would walk behind him and look at where there were any gaps.and cut and refit until it looked like it was extremely suitable.""she said. One concern was that the other penguins would reject Pierre in his new suit,but in fact,they accepted his new look.He swam freely and got along with others well,although he was the only penguin with a black stomach. Schaller couldn't say for sure whether the wetsuit allowed Pierre to recover his fine feathers,but"" certainly we were able to keep him comfortable during a period of time that would have been very difficult for him to stay comfortable"". Pierre will take off his suit after his new feathers grow back."	['the use of wetsuit on humans']
You can enjoy your blog safely if _ .	"Millions of young people are writing blogs . Millions of others are reading them. The word ""blog"" is a short way of saying Web log. Many popular Web sites now offer free, easy ways to create personal Web pages and fill them with writings and pictures. Web sites called ""Face book"" and ""My Space"" are some of the most popular blog sites for young people. Blogs offer young people a place to show their writings and feelings. They can also be helpful to connect young people with others. But blogs can become dangerous when they are read on the Internet by millions of people all over the world. Recent studies show that young people often tell their names, age and where they live on the Internet. That may not be safe for them. This personal information puts them in danger when found out by dangerous people who want to hurt them. Students can also get into trouble when they put information about others on their blogs. As a result, many schools don't allow using blogging web sites on school computers. Many schools have also begun teaching parents about the web sites. Parents should know what their children are doing online and should read their blogs to make sure they are not giving out personal information. One way to keep away from these problems is to use programs so that blogs can be read by ""friends only."" people can read the website only if they know a secret word chosen by the blogger."

Native butterflyattracting plants are better because _ .	Butterfly gardens can be grown throughout the United States.There is a wide variety of both butterflyattracting (nectar) plants and host plants covering climate zones throughout the country.Butterfly gardens can range in size from a few containers placed in a sunny spot to several acres. Nectarproducing plants will attract butterflies to your garden.In order to support a full butterfly life cycle,host plants (for laying eggs and used as a caterpillar food source) must also be present. Throughout the country,the general requirements for butterfly gardening are the same:full sun,nectar source plants,larval host plants,a pesticidefree environment,and knowledge of the local butterfly species.Many butterflyattracting plants are natives and require little attention,as they are naturally adapted to the region in which they live. Butterfly gardens are best planted in spring with younger plants or in fall with mature plants that will become dormant quickly and reemerge in spring.It is best not to plant in the heat of summer or the cold of winter. One of the most common mistakes in butterfly gardening is planting only one nectar source.Adult butterflies have a very short lifespan.Planting a variety of nectar sources will encourage more butterflies to visit the garden.Planting an adequate supply of host plants gives butterflies a place to lay their eggs,which will successfully hatch and result in butterflies that will continue to visit the garden. Butterflies typically lay their eggs in late spring and hatch 3-6 days after they are laid.It takes 3-4 weeks for a caterpillar to pupate and 9-14 days to emerge as an adult. Good resources for learning more about butterfly gardening include zoos,botanical gardens,butterfly houses,garden centers and nurseries,libraries and the Internet.There are many good websites dedicated to butterflies and butterfly gardening.

According to the passage,which is WRONG?	We people have homes.Animals have homes,too.

What can be the best title for the text?	On November 15th, 2014, children aged 8 to 12 got together in five cities around the world to participate in the first Global Children's Designation. The event that was organized by a Dutch company called Unexpect, challenged kids to come up with solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems in a day! The day began with the kids listening to the various challenges that were related to their particular cities and towns. The teams were then asked to brainstorm about which problem they were going to handle and how. There were so many amazing ideas produced on that day. While some of the ideas were far from perfect, there were many that could be practical like the smart cars which can ease traffic pressure by telling traffic lights of its arrival and also guiding the drivers to the best possible route . Emer Beamer, the founder of Unexpect, says the purpose of the project is to introduce children to skills they probably never learn in class. She says that for most part, schools focus on teaching things that they will most likely never need to know again. She believes that for kids to be successful in the world, they should be learning how to be creative, handle new technologies and deal with unexpected situations. Though the first global design challenge was relatively small, involving only a few hundred of the two billion youngsters that are bursting with ideas, the next one will be much bigger. That's because in 2015, Unexpect plans to distribute free tool kits to any school that is interested in hosting their own Children's Designation Challenge. We can't wait to see what ideas kids will come up with next.	"[""The first Global Children's Designation""]"
This passage tells us about _ .	"Orville Wright was born on August 19, 1871 in Dayton, Ohio, USA and died on January 30, 1948. Together with his brother, Wilbur, he was the first airplane builder. The brothers created the first controlled, powered and heavier-than-air human flight. His parents were Milton Wright and Susan Catherine Koerner and besides the two famous brothers they had five children. One day after a trip his father brought as a gift a small helicopter. The kids loved it and as they played daily with it after a while it broke. The brothers managed to create a new one. Wright even let go his plans of attending Yale. He spent his time helping his ill mother and reading in his father's library. In 1884 the family decided to move to Dayton and they remained there until the 1870's. A printing press was built by the two and Wilbur was an editor. In 1892 they started being fascinated by the aeronautical events of that time. Then they started to create an airplane and Wilbur was considered the head of the team. They were the inventors of ""three axis-control"", which permitted the pilot to _ the aircraft's balance. In 1900 they had their first attempts to make a functional glider -- of course it didn't have a pilot. After three years they thought of introducing an engine to the glider. At first, their patent application was refused in 1903, but after one year it was accepted. Orville's first flight lasted 12 seconds and had 36.5 meters. He was responsible with the public shows near Washington in the United States. On September 9, 1908 his flight was 62 minutes and 15 seconds long and the success was huge."

When she returned from the meeting, Miss Evans found _ her lecture.	"Miss Evans was going to give a lecture on Friday afternoon. But on Thursday night she was told that she had to go to an important meeting the next day at the same time. ""No one can be in two places at the same time. What shall I do?"" she thought. But soon, she had an idea. At five to three on Friday afternoon, Miss Evans went to the lecture room. There were twenty students waiting there for her. ""I'm sorry,"" she told them, ""I won't be able to give my lecture today."" The students looked surprised. Miss Evans explained that she had an important meeting. ""However,"" she went on, ""though I can't be with you myself, my voice can.""

It can be inferred that the author _ .	"One of the qualities that most people admire in others is the willingness to admit one's mistakes. It is extremely hard sometimes to say a simple thing like ""I was wrong about that, ""and it is even harder to say, ""I was wrong, and you were right about that. "" I had an experience recently with someone admitting to me that he had made a mistake fifteen years ago. He told me he had been the manager of a certain grocery store in the neighborhood where I grew up, and he asked me if I remembered the egg cartons . Then he related an incident and I began to remember clearly the incident he was describing. I was about eight years old at the time, and I had gone into the store with my mother to do the weekly grocery shopping. On that particular day, I must have found my way to the dairy food department where the incident took place. There must have been a special sale on eggs that day because there was an impressive display of eggs in dozen and half-dozen cartons. The cartons were stacked three or four feet high. I must have stopped in front of a display to admire the stacks. Just then a woman came by pushing her grocery cart and knocked off the stacks of cartons. For some reason, I decided it was up to me to put the display back together, so I went to work. The Manager heard the noise and came rushing over to see what had happened. When he appeared, I was on my knees inspecting (examining)some of the cartons to see if any of the eggs were broken, but to him it looked as though I was the criminal. He severely scolded me and wanted me to pay for any broken eggs. I protested my innocence and tried to explain, but it did no good. Even though I quickly forgot all about the incident, obviously the manager did not."	['has forgiven the manager for what he did to him fifteen years ago']
On Indian public transport, you can always expect to see people _ .	It's interesting to see how people make use of the time they spend on public transport in Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai. In crowded buses and trains people manage to take a short nap and some even reach the snoring stage. Or they spread out a newspaper over multiple knees and arms to read about the latest sport results or political crisis. Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so. They even have their specific seats so well-worn that you can make out the shape of their backsides. There is no doubt about it. Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring. It is impossible not to see every little flower by the wayside blooming proudly. And the warm sun manages to transmit some of their pleasantness to the inside of a bus or train. Now, wouldn't it be perfect if we had a public transport worth the name in all our cities?	['sleeping and reading newspapers']

We can infer that there are almost_college places for high school graduates.	"The terrible college entrance exam is not only a big challenge for Chinese high school students,but also a very important exam in the lives of South Korean students.Although the long,cold winter has already started in South Korea.the annual national exams have made the atmosphere very heated. More than 675,000 South Korean high school graduates took the college entrance exam last Wednesday.They usually take exams in Korean,maths,sociology,history and foreign languages. Officially there is one college place for every 1.33 students.But because all the students want to go to the top universities in the country,the competition can reach one place for 10 students.The students want to attend these colleges for both their famous names and better job opportunities. Because students face fierce competition,they have to study very hard to realize their dreams.park Seung said he and his classmates often go to school before 7:30 in the morning.After school has finished at 6:30 P.m,most of them go to the library to continue their study instead of returning home.Since many libraries in South Korea are open 24 hours a day,they often stay long into the night Many of the Senior 3 students only sleep for three to four hours a day. ""I feel a lot of pressure.but I have to study very hard in order to make my dream come true.This is my lifetime goal and it will be a turning point in my life which could decide my future,""Park said. The exam day is a very serious day for the whole of South Korea.Vehicles are not allowed within a 200-metre radius of all the test sites to make sure the students have quiet surroundings.Noises are forbidden,even airplanes are ordered to avoid landing and take-off near the test sites during listening comprehension test hours. Students are told their scores in December before they apply for college.This is followed by face-to-face oral tests.There are public and private universities in South Korea .Many private universities are well-known, but their fees can be 18,000 yuan each term.This has made a lot of students think again."

According to the passage, readers in Guanlao's library _ .	"If you put all the books you own on the street outside your house, you might expect them to disappear immediately. But one man, Hernando Guanlao in Manila, tried it and found that his collections grew. He's a lovely man in his early 60s, with one ever-lasting love--books. They're his pride and joy, because, whether he likes it or not, they seem to be taking over his house. Guanlao has set up a ""library"" outside his home in central Manila. Readers can take as many books as they want, for as long as they want. As Guanlao says, ""The only rule is that there are no rules."" You might consider it would end very quickly. But in fact, in the 12 years he's been running his library. He's found that his collection has grown rather than become smaller, as more and more people help the activity. ""It seems to me that the books are speaking to me,"" he says with a smile, ""The books are telling me they want to be read."" Guanlao started his library in 2000, shortly after the death of his parents. He was looking for something to honor their memory, and that was when he hit upon the idea of promoting the reading habit passed on to him from his parents. So he put the books outside the door of his house to see if anyone wanted to borrow them. They did, and they brought the books back with others to add to the collection. The library was born. The library is not advertised, but somehow, every day, a steady stream of people find their way there. To help the poorest communities in Manila, Guanlao doesn't wait for them to find him on his ""book bike"". He wants to set up a ""book boat"", traveling around the islands of Sulu and Basilan. As we sat outside Hernando Guanlao's house in the midday sun, watching people look through his collection, he thought it was worth spending all his time."	['can be free to read there']
When did Chinese people invent the kite?	"Spring is a good time for kite flying -- a popular activity in China. On a sunny day with a good breeze , you'll see hundreds of colorful kites flying in the sky. They have all kinds of shapes like swallows and peaches. Some of the shapes have special meanings. For example, swallows mean good luck and peaches bring you a long life. The city of Weifang in Shandong is the home of the kite. The city holds an international kite festival in April every year. There are competitions for kite-flying skills and new styles of kites. The most famous is the competition for the ""Kite King "". Thousands of kite fans from more than 30 countries visit the city to take part in the competitions, or to just enjoy this colorful event . The largest kite in the world is a big ""octopus "". It's about 1,100 square meters, twice as big as a basketball court. Li Jingyang, a kite fanin Jilin, spent eight months making it in 2008. The kite was invented by Chinese people over 2,000 years ago. According to historical record, kites were first used by soldiers to send news to their friends. In the Tang Dynasty, flying kites became a popular game played by everyone. As it was introduced to the West in the ll00s, the kite brought a great influence on Western life. In 1782, the lightning rod was invented with the help of a kite. Modern aircraft came from kites, too. At the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, a board reads: ""The earliest man-made aircrafts were the kites and missiles of ancient China."""	['Over 2000 years ago.']
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	Koala bears as pets might be appealing to many of us. However, there are quite a few points to consider even before thinking of adopting one. Koala bears are one of the most lovely Australian animals. In certain cases where the koala has been raised by hand, they have turned out to be quite affectionate pets. These people tied a piece of fur to a pillow and placed it beside a joey (a baby kola) as a substitute for the mother koala. This trick seemed to work well with the baby koala. However, it is a known fact that human handling causes stress to koalas. In my personal opinion, this aspect clouds the fact that koala bears can be tamed . In Australia the koala is a priority animal as far as conservation status assessment is concerned. It was hunted to near extinction for its fur. In fact the koala had been wiped out from South Australia in the 1920s. However, rehabilitation efforts have brought the animal back in the state. As for the Australia government, the koala is not a threatened animal, but the US government does list the koala as one. Although they may live in 40 to 60 kinds of eucalyptus trees, they prefer only 10 to 14 specific kinds. Koalas sleep for most part of the day, which is about 16 to 18 hours, and for most of their waking hours all they do is eat. Koala bears eat the leaves of eucalyptus trees. A full-grown koala can eat almost 2 to 3 pounds of leaves in a day. Despite their slow movements and sweet look, koala bears can be _ when hungry. Other than this, there are the stress caused to koalas due to human handling and the fights that start in koalas. Almost everyone finds koalas lovely in the zoo. However, as far as having koala bears as pets is concerned, there are legal issues to consider. Other than that, being able to provide for its diet and habitat is another point that needs some attention before any law legalizing their adoption as pets is passed.

What was Dave's problem?	"""Whoosh!"" The ball flew into the net and the game was finally over. This game had gone into overtime twice.

Now the two teams should have a picnic together. Dave did not want to eat lunch with the other team. The other team would probably brag by talking about how they won the game. Dave went to the locker room to change out of his soccer clothes. There the coach talked to the team about what they had done well. They also talked about how they could improve. Then everybody walked outside towards the picnic table. One of the players from the other team was standing near the picnic table. He handed Dave a paper plate. ""Hi, I'm Miguel,"" he said. ""Hi,"" Dave replied, looking down at the ground. ""You played great,"" Miguel said. ""I didn't think we were going to win."" Dave was surprised. Miguel was not bragging at all. ""Thanks,"" Dave said to Miguel. ""You played great, too."" Dave felt happy. Dave promised himself that the next time his team won a game, he would not brag to the other team. It was wonderful to win, but it was even more important to be a good winner."	"[""He didn't want to eat with the winning team.""]"
_ can make several different sounds.	"Animals, including insects , don't have a 'language' like ours. They do not 'talk' to each other in words and sentences . But if we watch them, we can see that they have their ways of communicating with each other. Can you see the rabbit's tail? When rabbits see this white tail moving up and down, they run away. They know that they are in danger. The rabbit told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal . Many other animals use this kind of 'language'. When a cobra is angry, it raises its head and makes itself look powerful . This warns other animals. When a bee found some food, it goes back to its home. It cannot 'tell' the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance. This tells the bees where the food is. Some animals 'say' things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when it is pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, evry sound has its own meaning. Sometimes we human beings speak in the same way. We make sounds like""Oh"" or ""Ah"" when we are afraid or happy or when we drop something on our toes."	['bird']
Why can coffee be used as a fuel?	"A car that runs on coffee is unveiled(shown to the public for the first time)today but at between 25 and 50 times the cost of running a car on petrol, the invention won't please any motor industry accountants. Nicknamed the Car-puccino, it has been created using a 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco bought for PS400 and it was chosen because it looked like the time-traveling DeLorean in the movieBack To The Future.The car will be driven the 210 miles between Manchester and London powered only by roasted coffee granules .It has been built by a team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes The Theory and will go on display at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester to show how fuels other than traditional petrol can power vehicles. The team calculates the Car-puccino will do three miles per kilo of ground coffee -- about 56 cups of espressos per mile.The journey will use about 70 kilos of ground coffee which, at supermarket prices of between PS13 and PS26 a kilo depending on brand and quality, will cost between PS910 and PS1,820, or between 25 and 50 times the PS36 cost of petrol for the journey.In total, the trip will cost 11,760 espressos, and the team will have to take 'coffee breaks' roughly every 30 to 45 miles to pour in more granules.They will also have to stop about every 60 miles to clean out the 'coffee filters' to rid them of the soot and tar which is also generated by the process.So despite a top speed of 60mph, the many stops mean the going will be slow, with the journey taking around ten hours. Sadly, the inventors will still have to pay duty on their coffee fuel---even though tax collectors at Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom haven't yet worked out how much. Nick Watson, producer of Bang Goes The Theory, said, ""Coffee, like wood or coal, has some carbon content so you can use it as a fuel.The coffee needs to be very dry and in granules to allow the air to move through the pile of coffee as it burns.The brand doesn't matter."" He said the same technology could be used to power a car on other unusual fuels, such as woodchips or nut shells, construction or agricultural waste."	['It contains some carbon content.']

What makes demographers begin to wonder about the standard of normal ageing?	"Elderly people are growing healthier, happier and more independent, say American scientists. The results of a 14-year study to be announced later this month reveal that the diseases associated with old age are affecting fewer and fewer people and when they do suffer a stroke , it is much later in their life. In the last 14 years, the National Long-term Care Survey has gathered data on the health and lifestyles of more than 20,000 men and women over 65. Researchers, now analyzing the results of data gathered in 1994, say arthritis, high blood pressure and circulation problems -- the major medical complaints in this age group -- are troubling a smaller proportion every year. And the data confirms that the rate at which these diseases are declining continues to increase. Other diseases of old age -- dementia, strokes, arteriosclerosis and emphysema -- are also troubling fewer and fewer people. ""It really raises the question of what should be considered normal ageing,"" says Kenneth Manton, a demographer from Duke University in North Carolina. He says the problems doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until people are 70 or 75. Clearly, certain diseases are beating a retreat in the face of medical advances. But there may be other contributing factors. Improvements in childhood nutrition in the first quarter of the twentieth century, for example, gave today's elderly people a better start in life than their former generations. On the downside, an increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing smoking habits and poorer air quality, say the researchers. ""These may be subtle influences,"" says Manton, ""but our subjects have been exposed to worse and worse pollution for over 60 years. It's not surprising we see some effect."" One interesting correlation Manton uncovered is that better-educated people are likely to live longer. For example, 65-year-old women with fewer than eight years of schooling are expected, on average, to live to 82. Those who continued their education live an extra seven years. Although some of this can be attributed to a higher income, Manton believes it is mainly because educated people seek more medical attention. The survey also assessed how independent people over 65 were, and again found a striking trend. Almost 80% of those in the 1994 survey could complete everyday activities ranging from eating and dressing unaided to complex tasks such as cooking and managing their finances. That represents a significant drop in the number of disabled old people in the population. According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United States government's medicare system more than $200 billion, suggesting that the ageing of America's population may prove less of a financial burden than expected. But independence can have drawbacks. Scientists found that elderly people who felt emotionally isolated maintained higher levels of stress hormones even when asleep. The research suggests that older people live best when they feel independent but know they can get help when they need it."	"[""People's growing healthier.""]"
Besides allowing people to set goals, the iOS app also _ .	"The vast majority of fitness trackers count your steps and are worn around the wrist, but now there's a device that's designed to be worn like a necklace and monitors tiny movements to improve your posture. The Fineck device aims to address neck pain by tracking tiny movement, spotting bad habits and suggesting exercises via an accompanying app. Made from silicone and titanium , Fineck monitors a wearer's movement, balance, posture and movement thanks to sensors inside. The Mountain View California-based firm says that a high percentage of people suffer from neck pain and associated problems, probably caused by more individuals doing office jobs, which generally involve leaning over computer keyboard. The device contains sensors, several different types of instruments to monitor movement, plus a monitor to shake. It connects to an IOS app via Bluetooth so that wearers can see their bad habits and play ""neck training"" games. The app warns of health risks and records a user's activity to build up a customer personal health description. The necklace shakes to give smart advice, such as reminding wearers to sit up straight. The app also allows users to set goals, like many other wearables do. ""Fineck is the first wearable device for your neck that tracks your neck activity and warn you when you are in a bad posture for too long. You can also exercise your neck with Fineck's interactive games."" The company writes on Kickstarter. ""No matter where you are and what you are doing at office, on the go, or simply just feeling bored, Fineck will bring you enriched exercise experience through motion sensing games and therapies."" It also claims that it is ""the world's first titanium wearable device"". The metal is widely used in fashion stuff that you can wear or carry to match your clothes because it is lightweight, durable and does not tend to cause allergic reactions. It also offers additional features such as shaking to indicate alerts on a user's smartphone, but it is not currently clear whether it can also be used like bands, to count steps, and so on. The Fineck has a battery life of around seven days and takes one hour to charge. It is available to pre-order via Kickstarter from $69(PS44)and is due to ship in March next year."

How much would users pay for the cell and scratch cards before they own a 2.5-watt solar cell?	Sunny countries are often poor. A shame, then, that solar power is still quite expensive. Eight19, a British company by Cambridge University, has, however, invented a novel way to _ this. In return for a deposit of around $10 it is supplying poor Kenyan families with a solar cell able to generate 2.5 watts of electricity, a battery that can deliver a three amp current to store this electricity, and a lamp whose bulb is a light-emitting diode . The firm thinks that this system, once the battery is fully charged, is enough to light two small rooms and to power a mobile-phone charger for seven hours. Then, next day, it can be put outside and charged back up again. The trick is that, to be able to use the electricity, the system's keeper must buy a scratch card--for as little as a dollar--on which is printed a reference number. The keeper sends this reference, plus the serial number of the household solar unit, by SMS to Eight19. The company's server will respond automatically with an access code to the unit. Users may consider that they are paying an hourly rate for their electricity. In fact, they are paying off the cost of the unit. After buying around $80 worth of scratch cards--which Eight19 expects would take the average family around 18 months--the user will own it. He will then have the option of continuing to use it for nothing, or of trading it in for a bigger one, perhaps driven by a 10-watt solar cell. In that case, he would go then through the same process again, paying off the additional cost of the upgraded kit at a slightly higher rate. Users would therefore increase their electricity supply steadily and affordably. According to Eight19's figures, this looks like a good deal for customers. The firm believes the average energy-starved Kenyan spends around $10 a month on oil--enough to fuel a couple of smoky lamps--plus $2 on charging his mobile phone in the market-place. Regular users of one of Eight19's basic solar units will spend around half that, before owning it completely. Meanwhile, as the cost of solar technology falls, it should get even cheaper.

The gardener didn't _ .	"One day Frank was walking with his mother when they came to a pretty garden. Frank looked in, and saw that it had clean gravel walks and beautiful flowers. He called to his mother and said, ""Mum, come and look at this pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and walk in."" The gardener heard what Frank said, and kindly invited him and his mother to come into the garden. Frank's mother thanked the man. Then she said to her son, ""Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you must take care not to meddle with anything in it."" Frank walked along the tidy gravel walks, and looked at everything, but touched nothing that he saw. He did not step on any of the borders , and was careful that his clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers so that he might not break them. The gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he was so careful to behave well. He showed him the seeds, and told him the name of many of the flowers and plants. While Frank was admiring the beauty of a flower, a little boy came to the gate, and finding it locked. He shook it hard, but it would not open. Then he said, ""Let me in. Let me in. Will you not let me in this garden?"" ""No,"" said the gardener, ""1 will not let you in, Tom. When I let you in yesterday, you meddled with my flowers, and pulled some of my fruit. I do not choose to let a boy into my garden who meddles with the plants."" Tom looked ashamed, and when he found that the gardener would not let him in, he went slowly away. Frank saw and felt how much happier a boy may be by not meddling with what does not belong to him. He and his mother then continued their walk in the garden, and enjoyed the day very much. Before they left, the gardener gave each of them some pretty flowers."	['let Tom in the garden a second time']

Over the centuries,various scholars have attempted to produce a universally agreed-upon theory of humor.Plato and Aristotle introduced the superiority theory,the idea that people laugh at the misfortune of others.Their theory seems to explain teasing,but it doesn't work well for knock-knock jokes.Sigmund Freud argued for his relief theory,the concept that humor is a way for people to release psychological tension and reveal their inner fears and desires.His theory works well for dirty jokes,less well for most puns. The majority of humor expels today agree with the incongruity theory,the idea that humor arises when there's a gap between what people expect to happen and what actually happens.Incongruity has a lot going for it -- jokes with unexpected funny lines,for example,fit well.But scientists have found that in comedy,unexpectedness is overvalued. With the goal of developing a new,more satisfactory explanation,I produced ""the gentle violation theory"",the idea that humor arises when something seems wrong or threatening,but is actually OK or safe.A dirty joke,for example,trades on moral or social violations,but it's only going to get a laugh if the person listening is open enough to consider the subject OK to talk about.Similarly,puns can be seen as linguistic violations that still make grammatical sense. And while most humor theories have struggled to account for tickling ,or just avoided the phenomenon altogether,my theory accounts for even this kind of laughter.Tickling involves violating someone's physical space in a gentle way.People can't tickle themselves -- because it isn't a violation."	"[""Because people's understanding of violation is different.""]"
The population is increasing fast partly because _ .	Is the world too crowded? Well, that's a hard question to answer. It's all a matter of perspective .In Montana, you might drive for a mile in any direction and not see another human being. In Macao, 60,000 people live in every square mile! What is true is that the world's population doesn't stay the same. It has been increasing at a very fast rate .That's in part because in each generation these are more people who then have children than in the last generation. Five hundred years ago, the population of the world was about 460 million. In 1900,the world's population was under 2 billion .Right now it is doubling every 40 years. That means, if this rate of growth continues, when you are a parent, there will be twice as many people on earth as there are now. Wow! Now that's a whole lot of people! Soon the world's population will probably reach 7 billion. Some people worry about that! But there is a lot of disagreement about just how many people on earth equals too many people. But everyone agrees that the more people there are, the more resources the world needs to feed, house and take care of all of them, and the more need there is to think carefully about how we live and use the earth's resources.

What can be a suitable title for the text?	"When young people begin to live independently, home-hunting can bring some stress. But they would do well to remember that a new alternative is available--micro-home. Called ""tiny houses"", these houses have all living necessities in a small package, including kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Generally under 50 square meters, most tiny houses accommodate just one or two people though some claim the space for more. What's lost in size is not lost in design as these homes are often quite unique and modern in design. Besides an attractive appearance, tiny houses can also have unique practical features. Making the best of urban space, the 72- to122-centimeter-wide Keret House in Warsaw, the world's narrowest home, fills in an alley. The Ecocapsule home uses solar power, wind power and rainwater collection to enable its owner to live practically anywhere. A system of rails allows the DALE micro-home to adjust room size and number as well as adding the option of an open or enclosed courtyard. Visually appealing as micro-homes are, there are a few drawbacks to consider before getting cozy on a mini-couch. Moving into a tiny house requires the removing of most non-essentials, regardless of the emotional connection to them. Guests will also mostly be out of the question as the limited space may even cause a solitary individual to experience some cabin fever . And finally, a micro-home is likely a temporary living option for most people since they will probably start families and acquiremore possessions. Though the limitations will scare some, there is usually a benefit. A small size results in a small price tag and small bills, making tiny houses easier to save up for and budget. And though you won't have much stuff around the house, this can provide the comfort of simple living and repairs. Micro-homes are also practically mobile and have eco-friendliness that can't be matched by other homes. They probably aren't for everyone or forever, but when it comes to your next (or first) home, they could be just what you need."	['Micro-homes--More Than Tiny!']
It can be learned from the passage that both writers think of their jobs as _ *	"I've been working as a professional clown for nearly two years. Before that, I was an actor for nine years. I was never famous, but I was quite successful! I changed jobs because I wanted to do more in life than make people laugh. What if I could help people, too? As a clown, I try to encourage sick children in hospital to laugh and smile. When you laugh, your mind and body relax. Clearly, people who laugh more don't have as many colds or other problems! Children who laugh a lot often get better results in their studies, too. It isn't an easy job. Not all sick children get better, and sometimes I come home and cry. But I always go back to work the next day with my red nose on. l don't earn much money as a clown, but I feel very lucky to work with such brave and wonderful patients. I became a laughter yoga teacher more than two years ago. Before that, I was a dentist! My job was very difficult, and I used to feel _ . Now I still improve people's health, but everything else is completely different. Everyone has fun in a laughter yoga class, including the teacher! No, laughter isn't ""magic"". It doesn't prevent all illness, keep you young, or make you beautiful. But did you know that it's an excellent kind of exercise? You move your whole body when you laugh! Sometimes I work with famous people. It's true that being rich can be stressful! Some famous people can be unpleasant at times, but I try to change their bad feelings. Laughter is excellent for people like musicians, artists and writers, because it helps people to be more creative."	['good ways of making people happy and healthy']
The passage mainly talks about _ .	Madame de Stael says that only the people who can play with children are able to educate them. For success in training children, the first condition is to become a child oneself. It means to treat the child as really one's equal, that is, to show him the same consideration, the same kind of confidence one shows to an adult. It means not to affect the child to be what we ourselves want him to become, but to be affected by the impression of what the child himself is; not to treat the child with cheating, or by force, but with the seriousness and true love suitable to his own character. Not leaving the child in peace is the greatest problem of present methods of training children. Parents do not see that during the whole life, the need of peace is never greater than in the years of childhood, an inner peace under all outside liveliness. But what does a child experience? Corrections, orders, interference , the whole livelong day. The child is always required to leave something alone, or to do something different, to find something different, or want something different from what he does, or finds, or wants. He is always guided in another direction from the true inner will that is leading him. All of this is caused by our so-called enthusiasm in directing, advising, and helping the child to become the same model produced in one assembly line . Understanding, the deepest characteristic of love, is almost always absent. To bring up a child means carrying one's soul in one's hand; it means never placing ourselves in danger of meeting the cold look on the face of the child. It means the truth that the ways of injuring the child are limitless while the ways of being useful to him are few. How seldom does the educator remember that the child, even at four or five years of age, has already had a sharp feeling! The smallest mistrust and unkindness, the least act of injustice, leave wounds that last for life in the heart of the child. While, on the other hand, unexpected friendliness and kindness make quite as deep an impression on those soft senses.	['misleading zones and right ways in educating children']
The farmer felt amazed because _	"Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic. He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were not willing to work on farms along the Atlantic because they worried about the terrible storms that destroy buildings and crops. The farmer received a steady stream of refusals at the interview for a farmhand Finally, a short, thin man approached the farmer. ""Are you a good farmhand?"" the farmer asked him. ""Well, I can sleep when the wind blows. "" answered the little man. Although puzzled by this answer ,the farmer, desperate for help, hired him. The little man worked well around the farm ,busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work. Then one night the wind howled loudly from offshore. Jumping out of bed,the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, "" Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they are blown away! "" The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, ""No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows. "" Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire him on the spot ,Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement,he discovered that all of the hay had been covered. The cows were in the bam,the chickens were in the coops,and the doors were barred The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down, Nothing could be blown away. The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he also returned to his bed to sleep while the wind was still blowing."	['everything was in safety']

"By saying ""This day should be a shopper's dream"", the writer means _ ."	"The Friday after the American holiday of Thanksgiving is called Black Friday. It's said that it's the day that store ledgers move into the black and companies become profitable. On that day, retailers slash prices to get consumers to buy. It is also a time when many Americans start their Christmas shopping. VOA's Elizabeth Lee tells us how the economy may affect consumers on that bargain day. This day should be a shopper's dream. ""It's just the deals, the sales and everything you can get for a lesser price,"" said Sandy Thomas, a shopper. But it's a nightmare for others. ""I think it's crazy. I've done all of my shopping throughout the week so I don't have to go out on Friday,"" she said. It's called Black Friday, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season in the United States. Every year it's the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Stores open before sunrise and there are deep discounts everywhere you look. Last year a crowd of bargain-hunters killed a Wal-mart worker in a New York suburb. This year, many stores are increasing security while they slash prices. ""This is a huge time for the retail stores,"" said Fred Joutz from George Washington University. ""This is when they begin making their profits for the year."" Economics professor Fred Joutz says how Americans spend the weekend after Thanksgiving is a good indication of how consumers feel about the future. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Joutz says Americans are saving more and spending less. Some retailers are attracting consumers by opening on Thanksgiving Day, when shops are traditionally closed. Other stores open their doors anywhere from midnight to four in the morning. And shoppers will be lining up in front of the doors in order to be one of the first ones to walk through and get a big discount. Electronics like flat screen TVs are usually the first items to go. Sandy Thomas says it's an annual family tradition and well worth it. ""I just save maybe half of what I would have spent on a regular, you know, shopping trip,"" she said. Economists say U.S. consumers will spend money this Black Friday, but they will spend it more carefully."	['shoppers can buy many items at low prices on that day']
What can we learn from the story?	If you had billions of dollars, would you donate almost all of it to charity? Well, that's what Mark Zuckerburg, CEO and founder of Facebook, just said he would do. Zuckerburg and his wife Priscilla Chan promised to give 90% of their Facebook _ to society. Right now that is about $45 billion, and they plan to donate the money to things like science and education. Many billionaires have done similar things. Bill Gates, creator of Microsoft, made The Giving Pledge, an activity in which billionaires promise donate more than half of their wealth to charities. This started in 2010, and now 139 people from 15 countries joined it. But giving back and helping others isn't just for big billionaires. People like Zuckerberg, and Gates may have more to give, but people with less are doing it, too. Especially around the holidays, people want to do their part and give back to people who are less lucky than them. Schools may have food collections where people bring a few food items*, and together they can make a big donation to places like homeless people's homes. People also host special events like concerts of runs to be creative while raising money. Regular people donate whatever they can to US charities like the United Way and the American Red Cross. Then these charities are able to help US communities in different ways like education, health and improving the lives of the poor. These individual* donations come together to make a big difference.

"Job-hopping means "" _ ""."	"Most Americans enjoy moving from place to place. For example, they often drive their cars 120 to 160 kilometres away just to have dinner with a friend or even fly to London or Paris just to watch a football match. In some states only one person in five lives in a place for more than five years. One may be born in one city, and go to school in another. He may finish his middle school in two or three cities, and then go to college far across the country. When he begins to work, he may possibly move from job to job. Moving from one job to another, which is called ""job-hopping"", can be seen in many places in the United States. Job-hopping does good to workers because every change of a job gives them a chance to get better pay. And job-hopping also gives bosses the chance to get new ideas and skills from him or her."

Zhao Li _ on the computer in her room.	Hello. My name is Liang Bin and I'm 13 year sold. I come from Wuhan. In the morning I get up at half past six, and then I run near my home. At twenty past seven, I have breakfast with my parents. Usually I have eggs and milk. Sometimes I have bread and fruit juice. but I don't eat meat. I go to school at twenty to eight. My favourite subject is English and I like talking with my friends in English. Hi , I'm Zhao Li and I'm 13 years old. I'm from Xi'an and I'm a student in Grade 7. There are four people in my family and my sister and I share the same room. Every morning my sister and I get up at half past six, and then we read our Chinese or English books after we walk near my home for twenty minutes. At half past seven, we go to school. We are in the same school but we are not in the same class. I'm in Class 1 and my sister is in Class 2. There is a black computer in our room. We do our homework and talk with our friends on it.

"If you've been joining in chat room conversations, or trading e-mails with net pals , you have become one of the millions who write in a special, short form of English. Throughout the world, every night children and their elders are ""talking"" online-many of them are talking at the same time. It's fast: trying talking to six people once. It's convenient: three or four words per exchange. It takes cleverness, concentration and quick fingers. And it requires very simple language. There's neither time nor space for explanations. Why waste valuable time telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB (be right back) will do? Want to enter a conversation? Just type PMFJI (pardon me for jumping in). Interested in whom you're talking to? Type A/S/L, the nearly universal request to know your pal's age, sex and location. You may get 15/M/NY as a reply from your pal. If something makes you laugh, say you're OTF (on the floor), or LOL (laughing out loud), or join the two into ROTFL (rolling on the floor laughing). And when it's time to get back to work or go to bed, you type GTG (got to go) or TTYL (talk to you later). People want to write as fast as possible, and they want to get their ideas across as quickly as they can. Capital letters are left in the dust, except when expressing feeling, as it takes more time to hold down the ""Shift"" key and use capitals. Punctuation is going too."

Why did A1 live a poor life again after he won the lottery?	A few years ago,my friend Al won the lottery. It changed his life. He did not have a rich family. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead,he is back to living on a shoestring--a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He is wise about small things,but not about important things.

What about the officials ranking below minister-or-governor levels in terms of official vehicles?	"BEIJING , March 9 --- The central government will require an additional three years of use for official vehicles for ministers and governors to reduce the costs of purchasing new cars, media have reported. The new rule has been applied among all Party and government departments nationwide, theBeijing Newsreported on Tuesday. The new rule has not yet been made public, said Li, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee. Under the old rules, the cars used by minister-level officials could be replaced as often as every five years, Li said. These officials will also keep the same cars when they assume new posts, he added. The new rule also reiterated that officials ranking below minister-or-governor-levels should not be allocated cars. The cars possessed by their departments should be used on demand. ""It violates the rules for lower-ranking --- even county-level-officials to be allocated cars,"" Li said. Purchases of vehicles for official use have been heavily investigated, as they account for a large expenditure of public funds every year. A survey on the Web news www.ifeng.com found 64 percent of respondents believed the new rule will be difficult to carry out because it is related to officials' interests. ""Local government departments had halted approvals for requests for such vehicles and had started to work on new quotas under the new rules,"" Li said. ""The future reform of official vehicle use will introduce market mechanisms and monetization."" Premier Wen Jiabao said in the annual government work report on Saturday that expenditures on such vehicles will not increase in 2011 compared with a year ago. Beijing's standing deputy mayor Ji Lin last week said the municipal government will release the number of vehicles for official use in the capital as early as at the end of this month. Earlier this month, the Minister of Finance had published a rule regulating the budgets for such vehicles."	['They can use cars whenever officially necessary.']

The passage is mainly about _ .	"When you get tense about something that happens in your life, you are experiencing stress. Too much stress can cause anger, depression and other related symptoms, which you need to seriously look into. The following are simple ways that can be used to deal with stress. Be Gentle with Yourself There are times when you are not fair to yourself. Often you are harder on yourself than you are of other people. If you can learn to accept yourself just the way you are, especially unconditionally, this would reduce the pressure you apply to yourself. Exercise Go for a walk. Go to the shops. You can join a local walk, swim or jog team. If you are tired out from doing housework and haven`t left your workstation, have a stretch. Change your environment for an hour or so. Stop Comparing Yourself with Others Often you don`t realize that a great deal of unhappiness is caused by constant comparisons you make. You says, ""if only I had a big house like she was..."", ""if only my husband were as rich as hers..."" The comparison is endless. The only comparison that counts is the comparison between where you were and where you are now . By all means, admire others, congratulate them and be proud of their achievements, but remind yourself that only you can decide the standard you want to set for yourself. Talk the Stress Out Sometimes it helps to share or talk about your stress to close friends or family members. The other person`s active listening can help."	['how to deal with stress in life']
What would be the best title for the text?	"At times Marty made it sound too easy. On a visit to his home I heard him say, ""People need to decide to be happy."" I pressed him. ""What do you mean by that?"" His face took on an skeptical look. ""You have to ask me?"" At that moment I felt a little foolish. Complex human problems, at least to me, often prevent people from being happy. To Marty it was a matter of common sense. I wondered, what was I missing? That night Marty told me a story that was very personal for him. I knew Marty and Mickey had four children. I didn't know there had been a fifth. She was their second child. She died shortly after birth. ""The funeral director was a super guy,"" Marty said. ""He knew we didn't have any money, but he told us he would take care of our little girl. He went out and built a wood casket for her."" Marty's voice started to break. ""He only charged us five dollars. It's stuff like that. You can look for the good in people and you'll find the good.

Marty's life was filled with minimum-wage jobs, borrowing on insurance policies, and working overtime to make a little more money. In my lifetime I had seen people in similar circumstances grow angry. Bitterness took hold of their lives and choked them. ""I never had much money, and I don't think I ever will."" Marty said. ""People think they need to have a lot of things to make them happy. They ought to look around and see what's really important."" When Marty looked around, he saw the most beautiful girl in the world as his wife, four children who loved him, a home he took pride in, and a job that made him feel alive. He was happy because, in his mind, he had it all."	['The source of happiness']
The writer decided to run a marathon because _ .	"In December of l 992.I was a happy husband and father of two young children.A month later,I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia . After two years of chemo that helped control the disease,my body was weak and lifeless.I felt as if I were a puppet who needed help to lift his arms or hold up his head. I began to run.After six months my strength had come back.On one of my runs,one where I felt I could run forever,I decided I was going to try to run a marathon. After telling my Dad about my plan,he told me of a program that trains people to run a marathon,while raising funds for Leukemia research at the same time.So that summer,through the Leukemia Society's Team in Training program,I started to train for the Marine Corps Marathon.During mile after mile of uncertainty,the day finally came to run the marathon. On October 27,1996,at 8 A.M.,along with l9,000 other brave souls I started on a 26.2-mile journey that I will never forget. I first saw my wife Patty at the six-mile mark . She seemed happy that I was still looking as if I knew what I was doing,and having a good time doing it.At Mile l7,my mind was going back to those two horrible years that tried to bring my family and me down.I saw her again.The concern in her face told me she knew I was starting to struggle.I felt as if we were thinking the same,nine more miles and these last few years will be behind us. That thought alone pulled me forward.Mile 22,23,slowing but going,24,25,then there it was.The Iwo Jima War Memorial.I have seen nothing so grand and inspiring in my life.Three hours and forty-one minutes after I started,I crossed what I think has to be the most fitting finish line in all of road racing! That night the Leukemia Society gave me a pin at a post-race party that simply says,""Leukemia 26.2"". If God wills,my cancer may once again take away my hair and my strength,maybe even my life.But it can never take away my pin,or the fact that I am a marathoner ."

Which of the following is NOT talked by the writer?	The world has many beautiful sounds. We can hear the songs of birds and the laugh of people. We can listen to cool music and news reports. And it's all because of our ears! They bring us a world of sounds. But some people can't hear any sound at all. Some are born deaf. Others can hear well in their childhood, nut too many loud sounds hurt their ears later on. Many people in China can't hear ordinary sounds clearly. Lots of them are children. Most of them are born with good hearing. But six children of every 1,000 have hearing problems when they are born. And if a children has hearing problems, he or she usually will also have some learning problems at school. A lot of things can cause fearing problems, like, too much _ is not good for our hearing. And noise louder than 85 decibels can hurt our ears and make us lose our hearing for a short time or even for ever. Hearing is important for all of us. So we should do our best to give our ears special care. Don't forget to do the following: * Try to stay away from places with too much noise. If you have to go, wear earplugs. * When swimming, remember to put earplugs into your ears to stop water from getting in. * Never put anything sharp into your ears. If you think you have too much earwax, ask your parents to help you clean it out. Keep these things in mind. _	['Illness and hearing problems.']
We learn from this passage that in the 19th century _ .	During the 20th century there has been a great change in the lives of women.A woman marrying at the end of the 19th century probably has been in her middle 20's and would be likely to have seven or eight children.By the time the youngest was 15,the mother would have been in her early 50's and would expect to live a further 20 years,during which chance and health made it hard for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children.Usually a woman's youngest child will be 15 when she is 45 and she can be expected to live another 35 years and is likely to get paid work until 60. This important change in women's life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position.Even a few years ago most girls left school and took a fulltime joB. However,when they married they usually left work at once and never returned to it.Today the school-leaving age is 16,many girls stay at school after that age,and though women marry younger,more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born.Many more return to work later.Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage,with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties of family life.

What do you think is the best title of the passage?	"There is good and bad news for parents today. The word ""mother"" has been voted the most beautiful word in the English language. But ""father"" failed even to make it on the list of the 70 best words in a survey of thousands of non-English speakers across the world. From Ankara to Zurich, ""mother"" was voted above ""love"", ""smile"" and ""blossom"". In second place was ""passion"", followed by ""smile"", ""love"" and ""eternity"", with ""fantastic"", ""destiny"", ""freedom"", ""liberty"" and ""tranquility"" completing the top 10. The results were given by the British Council which carried out a huge survey of more than 40,000 people in 102 non-English speaking countries. The study was done to celebrate the group's 70th anniversary --and it threw up a few surprising words to the list. ""It's interesting that 'mother', the only word of the 70 that describes a direct relationship between people, came top of the poll "",said British Council spokesman Greg Selby. ""It is great to see words in the survey that are so positive and suggestive of the British Council' s purpose -- words such as 'freedom', 'liberty', 'peace'."" Those surveyed were allowed to choose their words on either meaning or sound, said Mr. Selby. This explained why words that are satisfying to pronounce, like ""flip-flop"", made the list. Famous mothers like Kate Winslet, Elle Macpherson and Claudia Schiffer have all done their bit to make the word popular. Kate, 28, even stopped shooting Woody Allen's new film to spend more time with her young family. Singer Robbie Williams is proud to express his love for his mother, while actor Peter Kay went through a marathon British tour to pay for a new house for his mom. The mood was added to by Britney Spears, yesterday as she showed her love for her mother. She said: ""My mom was and still is a supermom. She is just so much fun and I think the reason why I love so much her is because she's a young mom."" She added: ""Mom, thanks for being the best role model--you rock."""

Where is this passage probably taken from?	"The Royal Mint has chosen Beatrix Potter's thieving Peter Rabbit as the first character from children's literature ever to appear on a UK coin. Peter, pictured in the blue jacket that he is forced to abandon in the garden of Mr McGregor when he is caught stealing vegetables, is captured on a special, coloured edition of a 50p coin available from now. The Royal Mint, which described Peter as ""the most recognizable of Potter's creations, and one of the most cherished from children's literature"", will release uncoloured versions of the coin in change later this year. Three more of Potter's characters will also be committed to currency later this year, as part of celebrations marking 150 years since the children's author's birth. The images have been created by coin designer Emma Noble, who said it was ""amazing to be given the opportunity to work with such famous and treasured literary characters"". Potter's The Tale of Peter Rabbit, featuring Peter and his better-behaved siblings Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail, was the first of her stories to be published, released in 1902 by Frederick Warne & Co. Potter would go on to follow it with a series of much-loved stories which remain popular today, from The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin to The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck."	['A news report']
"""Meals on the House "" in this story means _ ."	"Mr and Mrs Smith have just opened a small restaurant. In order to _ , they put a notice in front of the restaurant, which said "" Meals on the House for Three Days."" A foreign student who didn't know much English happened to pass by the restaurant on the second day. It was lunch time and he felt very hungry. ""Well, here is a restaurant. I am going to have something to eat."" He walked towards the restaurant when he saw the notice. "" American people are really strange. They even eat dinners on the house! But how can I get up to the top of the house?"" he said to himself. He looked around and found a ladder against a tree nearby. He was very glad. But as he reached the top he heard someone shouting at him. "" Hey, what are you doing up there?"" Mr Smith was looking at him angrily and beside him was a policeman. "" Don't your notice say "" Meals on the House for Three Days""? Is it just a joke?"" the foreign student answered. On hearing this, both Mr Smith and the policeman laughed. "" Don't you know what ON THE HOUSE means? Look it up in the dictionary,"" the policeman said."	['you can eat a meal without paying']

What did the writer want to do when his mother came home?	"When you are little, the whole world feels like a big playground. I was living in Conyers, Georgia the summer it all happened. I was a second grader, but my best friend Stephanie was only in the first grade. Both of our parents were at work and most of the time they let us go our own way. It was a hot afternoon and we decided to have an adventure in Stephanie's basement. As I opened the basement door, before us lay the biggest room, full of amazing things like guns, dolls, and old clothes. I ran downstairs, and spotted red steel can. It was paint. I looked beyond it and there lay even more paint in bright color1s like purple, orange, blue and green. ""Stephanie, I just found us a project for the day. Get some paintbrushes. We are fixing to paint."" She screamed with excitement as I told her of my secret plans and immediately we got to work. We gathered all the brushes we could find and moved all of our materials to my yard. There on the road in front of my house, we painted bit stripes of color1s across the pavement . Stripe by stripe, our color1s turned into a beautiful rainbow. It was fantastic! The sun was starting to sink. I saw a car in the distance and jumped up as I recognized the car. It was my mother. I couldn't wait to show her my masterpiece. The car pulled slowly into the driveway and from the look on my mother's face, I could tell that I was in deep trouble. My mother shut the car door and walked towards me. Her eyes glaring, she shouted, ""What in the world were you thinking? I understood when you made castles out of leaves, and climbed the neighbors' trees, but this! Come inside right now!"" I stood there glaring hack at her for a minute, angry because she had insulted my art. ""Now go clean it up!"" Mother and I began cleaning the road. Tears ran down my cheeks as I saw my beautiful rainbow turn into black cement. Though years have now passed, I still wonder where my rainbow has gone. I wonder if, maybe when I get older, I can find my rainbow and never have to brush it away. I guess we all need sort of rainbow to brighten our lives from time to time and to keep our hopes and dreams color1ful."	['To show his artwork to her']
What would psychologists advise on the relationships between friends?	"Can you imagine a stranger will read your e-mails without your permission or scan the website you've visited or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchases or cell phones bills? All of the things may happen to you one day. In fact, it's likely that some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permission? It might be a spouse, a girlfriend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen or even do something that may bring a disaster to you. Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, and that it's important to reveal to friends, family and lovers at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain nowadays. The digital bread crumbs you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to know who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can leak the deepest thought in your mind. Like it or not, increasingly _ The key question is: Does that matter? For many Americans, the answer apparently is ""No"". When opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most of them say they are really concerned about losing it. And 60 percent of the respondents say they feel their privacy is ""slipping away, and that bothers me"". But people say one thing and do another. Only a small of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that track automobile movements. Privacy economist Acquisti has run a series of tests that reveal people will give up personal information such as telephone number, address, or social security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cent-off coupon . But privacy does matter--at least sometimes. It's like health; when you have it, you don't notice it. Only when it's gone do you wish you'd done more to protect it. Without privacy, one will be naked in front of others."	['There should be a distance even between friends.']
Why did we start the campaign on food waste at schools? Because _ .	"It is reported by Chinese Xinhua News that students waste more food than the national average. So the campaign on school food waste is getting popular across the country. The move is part of a national campaign started by students at different schools. At East China University of Science, students who finish their food in the school dining hall get a special card when they return their plates after meals. Students can collect cards and exchange them for small gifts, such as books, schoolbags, magazines and umbrellas. ""It's been such a surprise,"" said Liang Zhaoyun, 19, a student in Shanghai. ""It has given us one more motivation to eat up our food."" ""The purpose of the campaign is not only to encourage students to finish their food. We hope it can also teach students to choose a more environment-friendly and healthy lifestyle,"" said Tao Siliang from University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Other schools also pay attention to the quantity of food. At Nanjing No.9 Middle School, rice is divided into three different-sized bowls that students can choose from according to their own need. ""It's great because I can try different dishes at half price and don't waste so much food,"" said Fan Peng, 15, a student from this middle school. What if you really can't finish all your food? At Changchun Normal College, they provide a take-away service. ""If you can't finish all your food, you can get a box to take the left food home. Even if you feed the cat, it's not wasted,"" said Zhou Zeyong, a student who learns Chinese education. ""I'm happy that we've cut down waste since joining the school 'eat-up' meeting. But some food is poorly cooked, meaning that students are not willing to finish it all. Some schools have taken note of this. So if we hope students try to waste less food, we should also improve the service and keep an eye on the meal quality on weekdays at school. If not, you can't complain students for throwing away much food,"" said Wang Guangji, the head-teacher of Beijing No. 29 Middle School."	['food waste at school is very serious']
The best title for the passage could be _ .	"It's a common belief that over time, pet owners start to look like their animals, and vice versa. Now conies the terrifying news that cats look up to their owners as role models and copy their behavior. Next time you reach for your fridge, think twice. If Kitty is watching, she is likely to overeat as well. What is your cat's IQ? In a new study from the University of Messina, it turns out that indoor cats who live closely to their owners ""mirror"" the lives of their caregivers. They sleep at the same time, eat at the same time, and can even become more or less social depending on the behavior of their owners. ""Cats are intelligent animals with a long memory, ""Jane Brunt, the executive director of the CATalyst Council, told Discovery News. ""They watch and learn from us, noting the patterns of our actions. as evidenced by knowing where their food is kept and what time to expect to be fed, how to open the cupboard door that's been improperly closed, and where their feeding and toileting areas fife. ""Because cats copy our habits, if you spend a lot of time raiding the fridge, your cat will return to its food bowl for that midnight snack, too. According to the study, _ explains why ""human and cat overweight rates often seem to match. ""So. if you felt guilty about leaving your precious kitty at home while you go to work, now you call feel even worse:You fife making your cat fat! There's no word if drinking green tea and making sure you go to Yoga will benefit your cat, but based on the study. it sounds like sticking to a healthy eating and sleeping schedule is best for both of you. There's a lot we can learn from our cats in return. ""When they sit on our laps softly purring with rhythmic breathing and half-closed eyes. the sense of peace and calm that comes over us is like a private 1esson in inner meditation. ""Brant said. Sure. But cats don't have to sit in rush hour traffic for an hour a day or worry about their in-laws. They're probably pretty good at remaining calm. So, according to science. even though we assumed that cats were not close to us all these years, it turns out they fife in fact learning from us and looking up to us. Scary, huh?"

The main reason for one's poor memory is that _ .	If you do not use your arm or your legs for some time, they become weak; when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again. Everybody knows that. Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong. If a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault . But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents are to blame , and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but usually they have better memories? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things they cannot write down in a little notebook. They have to remember days, names, songs and stories; so their memory is the whole time being exercised. So if you want to have a good memory, learn from the people: Practice remembering.

Why do most American children live far away from their parents?	Most American families are smaller than those in other countries. Usually there are one or two parents and one or two children in each American family. Children in the USA will leave their parents when they grow up. They want to find better jobs, so they usually live far away from their parents. They often write to their parents or call them. And they go to visit their parents during their holidays. Parents will ask their children to do some work around their house. In many families children will get money for doing some housework so that they can learn to make money for their own. Parents usually let their children choose their own jobs. Americans think that for young people it is important to decide on their lives by themselves.	['They want to have more chance  to look for better jobs']
Why do scientists feel it hard to made food on the plane taste good?	Many people travel to different places in the world by air. Usually it takes a long time, perhaps half a day, for passengers to stay in the plan. So airlines offer passengers food. But it is common that they feel bad about food taste. Do you agree? To solve this problem, airlines try hard to improve their food. They would like to do so because they don't want to lose customers. However, according to scientific research, part of the reason why plane food tastes bad is that at high altitude we can not taste things as well as we do on the ground. Also scientists have found that our noses become very dry even before a plane takes off. As the plane moves up, the change in air pressure reduces one third of the sensibility of our taste buds . So our taste buds become senseless. The sad face, however, is that our noses don't know it. All of these help explain why food on the plane tastes so bad. They also help explain why airlines choose to offer passengers salty and spicy food. Without doing so, the food would be tasteless. Now there are many researches on this. According to one of them, some volunteers are asked to lie with their feet higher than their heads for weeks. And scientists write down their feelings about food taste. Though scientists try their best, it is not as easy as they thought. Because they can't deal with the special environment successfully, such as the change in air pressure, making food taste good is still hard for them.

What is the most important thing of taking a staycation?	"We all need a vacation, whether with the entire family or your significant other. Unfortunately, many of us will not be able to follow through with vacation plans. But now, there is an alternative that is catching on rather quickly and it is called a ""Staycation"". A staycation is just what it sounds like, a vacation but you stay at home. It might not sound interesting, but you can turn it into a fun and relaxing getaway. Tell family and friends your plans. In their eyes you are truly on vacation and they only need to contact you in case of an emergency. Go outside; don't let the kids sleep all day. Go out and birdwatch, go fishing, explore the parks and nature, take in all you can of the outside world. You can even have a relaxing day at the beach, soak in some sun, and let the kids go swimming. Go on a picnic; have the kids fly kites. Bring some bubbles, and have a nice day with the wind blowing in your hair. Watch as the kids run and play and enjoy the beautiful outdoors. Camping is another fun way to have a staycation. If you have a camping ground in your area, you can go camping for a day or two and show the kids how it is to live right in the heart of Mother Nature. Just remember, it really doesn't matter where you decide to go, whether home or away. As long as you create quality time with your family you can strengthen the _ that may have been pushed aside during all the long stressful work hours. Time is the most important thing you can give to your husband, wife and kids, enjoying every moment together, and you will have lasting memories in your hearts."

"What influence did the author's experience in the ""Tribal Village"" have on her?"	"Until last summer I had a very comfortable life: winter vacations skiing and summer cruises. My parents spent a lot of money on a private school, so they could get me into a competitive middle school. Everything was about tomorrow, next year, my graduation. We never had to worry about today. Before last summer I never thought much about the people in the world who live day to day, every day, whose lives are controlled by poverty and hunger. Then I enrolled in a two-week intensive program. We lived in a ""Tribal Village,"" in a hot, dry open grassland in Arkansas, a state of the south-central United States. I am a tribal member in Mozambique, a country of southeast Africa. Every meal, I make the fire for my family, and feel the flames lick up my nostrils as I blow to keep the fuel alive. I cook mush with vegetables. This is all my family is ever given. I feed the hen and three rabbits their dinner. I grow attached to the rabbits, even though I know I shouldn't. I name them. I'm not getting enough to eat; it's time to decide whether or not to kill the rabbits. I feel pain but it's a privileged child's pain because I know I will soon be eating again. That's not true for a lot of other children around the world. Growing up comfortably in the U.S., I've never had to worry about my dinner, and even though this whole process was only a _ , it changed my life. Now I believe in doing whatever I can to help find practical ways to defeat hunger. So I've become president of Roots and Shoots, a group working to improve local environments for people and animals. I'm also working to create a program at my high school called the ""Safe Passage"" trip to help young people in the Guatemala City dump. And I've got plans to do more. I'm often thinking of laboring in the hot sun and the millions who still do. Now, I try to live for today and stop worrying so much about the future. When I eat or feel full, I am grateful for this fortunate life and want to extend the same feeling to others. I believe in offering help to those who need it."

The main topic of the passage is _ .	The invention of the electric telegraph gave birth to the communications industry.Although Samuel B.Morse succeeded in making the invention useful in 1837,it was not until 1843 that the first important telegraph line was constructed.By 1860 more than 50,000 miles of lines connected people east of the Rockies.The following year,San Francisco was added to the network. The national telegraph network strengthened the ties between East and West and contributed to the rapid expansion of the railroads by providing an efficient means to monitor schedules and routes.Furthermore,the extension of the telegraph,combined with the invention of the steam-driven rotary printing press by Richard M.Hoe in 1846,revolutionized the world of journalism.Where the business of news gathering had been dependent upon the mail and on hand-operated presses,the telegraph expanded the amount of information a newspaper could supply and allowed for more timely reporting.The creating of the Associated Press as a central wire service in 1846 marked the arrival of a new era in journalism.

David Birch claims that he only hires liberal-arts people because they _ .	"If you know exactly what you want, the best way to get a job is to get specialized training. A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training. That's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers. At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement. Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience. But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off. Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval. The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, but . As further evidence of companies gradually losing faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State's Scheetz mentions a pattern in hiring practices. Although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management. ""They want someone who isn't constrained by details to look at the big picture,"" says Scheetz. This sounds like a formal statement that you approve of the liberal-arts graduates. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems. David Birch, manager of the Boston Red Sox, claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, ""I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things,"" says Birch. For a liberal-arts degree, students focus on some basic courses that include literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior--plus a computer course or two. With these useful and important courses, you can feel free to specialize, ""A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace,"" says Scheetz."

The Fashion Week in Bishkek is supposed to _ .	"I have never heard about a ""Fashion Week"" outside of New York, London or Milan. But then one just happens to turn up in Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan. Actually, I'm ignorant of all those countries in Central Asia, whose names are always ending in ""stan."" For decades, even centuries, Central Asia has been out of focus, a blank on the map of empires. Just as the introduction from Turusbek Mamashov, from the Tourism agency of the president of the Kyrgyz Republic, says, ""Throughout this Fashion Week project, we need to create a revolution in the minds of our people, preparing the country for the international tourism market. It is an opportunity as well as an investment."" What he says is right. If you just give it aglimpse , you'll find out that theflavor of the Silk Road is still there. As part of the route for Silk Road traders and migrating tribes through itsepic history, Kyrgyzstan, like other Central Asian countries, is a vast place of desert, grassland and mountain ranges. It is not widely known that Kyrgyzstan is the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai's birthplace. Bishkek, the place holding Fashion Week, is the capital and industrial center of independent Kyrgyzstan. It is a relaxed, handsome place with wide streets and large amounts of greenery. Especially in the autumn of November, the yellow leaves falling everywhere make the whole city a legend in fall. The mountains are just at its rear, in that case a unique scene of picturesque beauty is composed by snow-white peaks, lakes and the urban Landscape. Today, Ala-Too Square is the center of the poetic places worth seeing in Bishkek. The ""White House,"" the seat of the Kyrgyzstan Government, is just at the west of the square. Behind this is Panfilov Park, a great place to head for a national holiday. The State Museum of Fine Arts is opposite, which is also called the Gapar Aitiev Museum of Applied Arts, featuring Kyrgyz jewelry, rugs and works by local artists. One of the joys besides the scenery is the openness of the people. Bishkek is a city without a big population but mainly good-natured people from many races, 47 percent are Russian and about a third are Kyrgyz. Most travelers vote Kyrgyzstan as the most appealing, accessible and welcoming of the former Soviet Central Asian republics. It is written by a tourist that Kyrgyzstan is the country Russians most desperately want to keep: hills always covered with grass and wild flowers. Kyrgyz men always ride a horse wearing a photogenic hat."	['promote tourism in Kyrgyzstan']
Yinzi is good at _ .	Do you know the girl in a hat with flowers on it? Her name is Yinzi. She is a nice Japanese girl, my new friend. She is in our class, studying Chinese. I like Yinzi.

Tom didn't take the train because _ .	"Last year when Tom graduated from school, he came to Taibei. He didn't like to work on his father's farm and hoped to find a job in a big city. He went from one company to another but no one wanted him. With little money left, he got to the station, sad and tired. All he wanted to do was go back to his small town. It was very late at night and the station was full of people. They were waiting to buy tickets of the last train. He bought the last ticket, and he was very happy. At that time, a woman with a crying baby walked to him and asked him to sell her the ticket. He gave her the ticket because he thought they needed it more than he did. After the train left, he sat on the bench and didn't know where to go. Suddenly, an old man came and said, ""Young man, I have seen what you did to the woman. I am the owner of a big company. I need a good young man like you. Would you like to work for me?"	['he gave his ticket to the woman']
"The ""public chopsticks and spoons"" are used to _ ."	"Of course, the main difference on the Chinese dinner table is chopsticks instead of knife and fork, but that's only superficial. Besides, in decent restaurants, you can always ask for a pair of knife and fork, if you find the chopsticks not helpful enough. The real difference is that in the West, you have your own plate of food, while in China the dishes are placed on the table and everyone shares. If you are being treated to a formal dinner and particularly if the host thinks you're in the country for the first time, he will do the best to give you a taste of many different types of dishes. The meal usually begins with a set of at least four cold dishes, to be followed by the main courses of hot meat and vegetable dishes. Soup then will be served (unless in Guangdong style restaurants) to be followed by staple food ranging from rice, noodles to dumplings. If you wish to have your rice to go with other dishes, you should say so in good time, for most of the Chinese choose to have the staple food at last or have none of them at all. Perhaps one of the things that surprise a western visitor most is that some of the Chinese hosts like to put food into the plates of their guests. In formal dinners, there are always ""public"" chopsticks and spoons for this purpose, but some hosts may use their own chopsticks. This is a sign of genuine friendship and politeness. It is always polite to eat the food. If you do not eat it, just leave the food in the plate. People in China tend to over-order food, for they will find it embarrassing if all the food is consumed. When you have had enough, just say so. Or you will always overeat!"	['put food into the plates of their guests']
What did people think of the boy when he was very young?	"A boy couldn't speak when he was 3 years old. A lot of people thought he was a foolish boy. When the boy was 9 years old, he could speak but he still couldn't speak well. His teacher didn't like him at all and his classmates laughed at him. He felt very sad, One day his father had a walk with him. They went to a wood and there were a lot of trees there. Then his father took him to two trees and said to him.""Boy, this tree is sabal (,)and this tree is fir . Sabal grows very quickly at first but a few years later, it will stop growing, so the tallest Sabal can't reach ten meters. But the fir is different, it grows very slowly at first but it never stops growing so it can grow very tall."" Then his father took him to another fir. It was so tall, so strong. It can reach the sky. The father said to his son, ""Son, you are the fir.""The boy understood his father's words. The boy became a very great scientist. Do you know who he is? He is the world-famous scientist. His name is Einstein."	['They thought the boy was foolish.']
"The phrase "" at random"" (Line 3, Para.2) means _ ."	Are some people born clever, and others born stupid? Or is intelligence developed by our environment and our experience? Strangely enough, the answer to these questions is yes. To some extent our intelligence is given to us at birth, and no amount of special education can make a genius out of a child born with low intelligence. On the other hand, a child who lives in a boring environment will develop his intelligence less than one who lives in rich and varied surroundings. Thus the limits of person's intelligence are fixed at birth, but whether or not he reaches those limits will depend on his environment. This view, now held by most experts, can be supported in a number of ways. It is easy to show that intelligence is to some extent something we are born with. The closer the blood relationship between two people, the closer they are likely to be intelligence. Thus if we take two unrelated people _ from population, it is likely that their degree of intelligence will be completely different. If on the other hand we take two identical twins, they will very probably be as intelligent as each other. Relations like brothers and sisters, parents and children, usually have similar intelligence, and this clearly suggests that intelligence depends on birth. Imagine now that we take two identical twins and put them in different environments. We might send one, for example, to a university and the other to a factory where the work is boring. We would soon find differences in intelligence developing, and this indicates that environment as well as birth plays a part. This conclusion is also suggested by the fact that people who live in close contact with each other, but who are not related at all are likely to have similar degrees of intelligence.	['aimlessly']
We can infer from the passage that, with the aim of being an ecological city by the 2008 Olympics, _ .	"While students in Hainan are quite used to clear skies, Beijing teenagers are not so lucky. As another warm winter approaches, the city can expect the normal clouds of smoke caused by air pollution. But things could start to get better soon. The government is co-operating with a US-based environmental protection agency to update existing buses and trucks with clean fuel technology. The new technology could reduce air pollutants in existing diesel vehicles by 40 per cent. The programme will begin by testing buses in Beijing to see if the technology can be applied to them. ""We encourage the development of public transportation. But at the same time we need to reduce pollution from them,"" said an official. Efforts are being made to improve the capital's environment with tighter controls on emissions . Some heavily polluting factories and construction sites, such as those owned by the steel giant Shougang Group, have been asked to cut production in November and December or be closed. Beijing was the third polluted city in the world at the end of last century, according to the UN. But thanks to recent measures, the capital has made some progress. Last year 224 clear days were rated as having good air quality. In 1998 the air quality index gave just 100 days as good. ""I am glad to see an improvement,"" said a Senior 1 boy living in the northwest of Beijing. ""Compared to other places, the air quality of Beijing is still worrying though. I hate the pollution. Once I was riding my bike in the morning when I almost had a traffic accident because I couldn't see a car only metres away from me in frog."" In early October, the skies were covered by such a thick fog that a display show by the visiting French air force was called off. Rapid development, industry, traffic fumes and sandstorms from the desert all contribute to the city's bad air."	['far more still needs to be done']
Why didn't Marie go to the supermarket by bus at first?	I went through a training program and became a literacy volunteer last surnmen The training I received, though excellent, did not tell me how it was to work with a real student, however. When I began to discover what other people's lives were like because they could not read, I realized the true importance of reading. My first student Marie was a 44-year-old single mother of three. In the first lesson, I found out she walked two miles to the nearest supermarket twice a week because she didn't know which bus to take. When I told her I would get her a bus schedule, she told me it would not help because she could not read it. She said she also had difficulty once she got to the supermarket,because she couldn't always remember what she needed. Since she did not know words, she could not write out a shopping list. Also, she could only recognize items by sight, so if the product had a different label, she would not recognize it as the product she wanted. As we worked together, learning how to read built Marie's self-confidence,which encouraged her to continue her studies. She began to make rapid progress and was even able to take the bus to the supermarketelt. After this successful trip, she reported how self-confident she felt. At the end of the program, she began helping her youngest son,Tony, a shy first grader with his reading. She sat with him before he went to sleep and together they would read bedtime stories. When his eyes became wide with excitement as she read, pride was written all over her face. As she described this experience, I was proud of myself as well. I found that helping Marie to build her self-confidence was more rewarding than anything I had ever done before. As a literacy volunteer, I learned a great deal about teaching and helping others. In fact, I may have learned more from the experience than Marie did.	"[""Because she couldn't find the right bus""]"

What is people's attitude towards Mr Dunbar's lateness?	"Jim Dunbar has been late for work, holidays, meals with friends, left women waiting on first dates and even had to sneak into funerals long after they've begun. The 57-year-old said that his poor timekeeping is down to a medical condition that he was diagnosed with at an appointment at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, which he was 20 minutes late for. It is thought that the condition is caused by the same part of the brain affected by those who suffer from Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and means Mr Dunbar cannot properly judge how long things take to complete. ""I blamed it on myself and thought.Why can't I be on time? I lost a lot of jobs.I can understand people's reaction and why they don't believe me,"" said Mr Dunbar. Mr Dunbar recently tried to go to the cinema and knowing it could be a problem getting there for a 7 pm showing, he gave himself an 11-hour head start.But he still managed to arrive 20 minutes late. He has a special clock in his living room to make sure that the time it displays is always exactly right, but it doesn't help.He has tried wearing a watch, setting his clocks fast but still hasn't found a solution. ""I've been late for funerals and slipped in and hid at the back of the hall.I arranged to pick my friend up at midday to go on holiday and was four hours late.He was angry because we had booked a ferry and everything.A friend invited me for a meal and I was more than three hours late.It has affected my entire life."" But some experts are skeptical about Mr Dunbar's diagnosis. ""The condition isn't in the DSM5 (the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) so I'm not sure you can really call it a condition,"" said Dr Sheri Jacobson.""Repeated lateness is usually a symptom of a condition such as ADHD or depression but it can also just be habit.I think making everyday human behaviour into a medical condition is unwise."""

Just sit in front of your computer, click your mouse and your things will be sent to your house in a couple of days. November 11this a big day for people who like shopping online. On that day last year, many online stores offered a big discount and free delivery service. The biggest online shopping sites in China,Taobao.com and Tmall.com ,sold things worth 19.1 billion yuan in total. ""Goods online are often much cheaper. It also saves me a lot of time. And we often have more goods on many online stores than in shopping malls,"" Wang Xin, an online shopping lover in Beijing, said to China Daily. She stayed up very late for a lot of cheap goods online. She spent several thousand that day. Another big advantage of online shopping is that it helps people get things from different cities, even different countries, _ . ""I like eating duck neck very much and I often buy it on Taobao from shops in Wuhan. It's much more delicious than what our local stores sell, but cheaper,"" said Zang Xin, a girl in Yangzhou. While enjoying online shopping, many people also have worries, especially for middle school student buyers. Young students are easily attracted by advertisements on the Internet and buy things they don't need. ""Middle school students should pay more attention to their study. Searching for things wastes their time,"" said Jing Chunling, an education expert. ""Besides, online shop owners have no idea of the ages of their buyers. Anyone can easily buy things that they want to. Some of goods are even bad for young students such as cigarettes and wine."""	['going to shops']
According to the writer, in order to stay beautiful, women should	"It seems that women and beauty go together. I think so. Look around yourself. Fashion ads are almost everywhere. Whether they have realized or not, a sea of. fashion is all around women. They are made to think that without beautiful clothes they will look old and lose their charm . So who doesn't want to dress up to be beautiful and young? But I don't agree with the opinion that women have to show their beauty through their looks. Their mind can be more beautiful and attractive than their looks. A woman has experienced many troubles and may be called ""aunt"", but she can still be beautiful if she has excellent qualities like knowledge, a kind heart and great courage . What's more,old and young, beautiful and ugly are relative. People who keep a young mind will never feel old. Knowing about new things and wanting to learn more,they can keep up with fashion. Simply dressed women are also beautiful in their own way. Reading and learning is the best way to keep one young. Good books can feed the flower of one's heart and looks."	['keep their mind young']
According to the passage, the U.S. elementary education is supposed to make children _ .	In the United Sates elementary education begins at the age of six. At this stage nearly all the teachers are women, mostly married. The atmosphere is usually very friendly, and the teachers have now accepted the idea that the important thing is to make the children happy and interested. The old authoritarian methods of education were discredited rather a long time ago--so much that many people now think that they have gone too far in the direction of trying to make children happy and interested rather than giving them actual instruction. The social education of young children tries to make them accept the idea that human beings in a society need to work together for their common goods. So the emphasis is on co-operation rather than competition throughout most of this process. This may seem curious, in view of the fact that American society is highly competitive; however, the need for making people sociable in this sense has come to be regarded as one of the functions of education. Most Americans do grow up with competitive ideas, and obviously quite a few as criminals, but it is not fair to say that the educational system fails. It probably does succeed in making most people sociable and ready to help one another both in material ways and through kindness and friendliness.	['happy and interested']

What was the study devoleted to figuring out?	"Some pigs lend lo be optimistic while others have a more pessimisitic view , according to a new research that is meaningful to animal welfare. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, is the first to show that mood and personality interact in an animal, influencing judgment. Asher, a researcher at ihc University of Newcastle's Institute of Neurowcience, and her team housed groups of pigs in the two types of environments. One reflected sandard commercial conditions and the other was _ with more space and plenty of sell, deep straw. After the pigs got accusitomed to these new homes over a few weeks , the rescarchers picked 18 pigs from each type of housing arrangement to train and test their judgment. "" To do this, we trained each pig that in one comer of a training room there would be a bowl wilh chocolate sweets -- specifically M&Ms, pigs love M&Ms -- and in a bowl at the opposite side of the room there would be a bowl that would contain coffee beans, which pigs find bitter-tasting,"" senior author Lisa Collins of the Univerersty of Lincoln's School of Life Sciences said. Over n number of training trials , pigs leamed to go to the bowl reliably when it was in the corner where they had figured out to expect M&Ms.On the contrary,they quickly leamed to avoid the bowl when it was't in the comer where they would expect to find the coffee beans. The rescearchers next placed an unfamimliar bowl in different locations , to see how the pigs would react. Some gaily dashed to the bowl no matter what, exhibiting optimism that it would contain there favorite sweds. Others, however, behaved as though they expected it to contain coffee beans, displaying pessimism. The findings suggest that a one -- size- fits - all answer to animal welfare issues does not exist. Even if pigs are just equal lo bacon or other meal for some people, there is still cause for conccrn . Student have suggested that how an animal is trented during is lifetime can directly affect meal quality and taste."	"[""The relationship between pigs' mood and judgment.""]"

When the writer says that today it is the TV that rules, he means that the TV _ .	In the late 1500s, a large powerful gun was placed on top of the Signal Hill, in prefix = st1 /Newfoundland, to prevent attacks from the outside. Flags were also flown there to warn sailors of bad weather. It's fitting, then, the Italian Gulielmo Marconi should have chosen this site to receive the world's first radio signal -- in Morse code -- from England on December 12, 1901. Marconi, combining earlier ideas with his own, led us to a new communications age. For the next 50 years, until the appearance of television, radio ruled the air waves. Today, it's the TV that rules. No single person can say to have invented television. In 1884, the German Paul Nipkow invented a device that sent pictures mechanically , and in 1906, Boris Rosing, a Russian, used a ray and a disc to create the world's first TV system. Then in the early 1920s, another Russian, Vladimir Zworykin,invented a picture display tube. He took out a patent for color1 TV, even though it wouldn't be developed for another 25 years. In 1924, a Scot entered the scene -- John Logie Baird. He first succeeded in sending a moving picture and a year later got the first actual TV picture. In 1926, Baird showed TV in aLondonlaboratory. Two years later inNew York, Felix the Cat became the first TV star. TV excited everyone's imagination, but hardly anyone had a set, with just two thousand in use worldwide in the mid-1930s. Since the late 1940s, TV technology has developed very quickly. Computers may finally be combined with all televisions to give people a total all-in-one communications network. Today, it's possible to sit and watch TV in the middle of a forest or in the Arctic. It's surprising when one considers that Marconi was on Signal Hill in the same century.

When did the tourist die?	"A Chinese tourist has died in Hong Kong a day after being beaten up during a so-called ""forced shopping"" tour.

Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour. Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not. ""The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,"" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.""This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates."" Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet. Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening. Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic recovery. Maria Angles Duran, a sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council, is skeptical that changing the time zone will reverse low productivity, which she attributes more to the structure of the service-oriented economy. But she agreed that a more normal work schedule would help women, who often complain that their husbands deliberately schedule meetings in the early evening. ""For men, this is perfect,"" Duran said, ""They arrive home and the children have already had their baths! Timetables can be used as a sort of weapon."""	['Time for Spain to turn back']
"What does ""ageing"" mean according to the passage?"	"The Process of Ageing At the age of twelve years, the human body is at its most vigorous. It has yet to reach its full size and strength, and its owner his or her full intelligence; but at this age the possibility of death is least. Earlier, we were infants and young children, and consequently more vulnerable ; later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance which, though vague at first, will finally become so steep that we can live no longer, however well we look after ourselves, and however well society, and our doctors, look after us. This decline in vigour with the passing of time is called ageing. It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make that we must decline in this way, that if we escape wars, accidents and disease we shall eventually ""die of old age"", and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, so that there are heavy odds in favor of our dying between the ages of sixty-five and eighty. Some of us will die sooner, a few will live longer -- on into a ninth or tenth decade. But the chances are against it, and there is a virtual limit on how long we can hope to remain alive, however lucky and physically strong we are. Normal people tend to forget this process unless and until they are reminded of it. We are so familiar with the fact that man ages, that people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time, of becoming more likely to die the older we get, was something self-evident, like the cooling of a hot kettle or the wearing-out of a pair of shoes. They have also assumed that all animals, and probably other organisms such as trees, or even the universe itself, must in the nature of things ""wear out"". Most animals we commonly observe do in fact age as we do, if given the chance to live long enough; and mechanical systems like a wound watch, or the sun, do in fact ran out of energy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics . But these are not similar or equivalent to what happens when man ages. A run-down watch is still a watch and can be rewound. An old watch, by contrast, becomes so worn and unreliable that it eventually is not worth mending. But a watch could never repair itself -- it does not consist of living parts, only of metal, which wears away by friction . We could, at one time, repair ourselves -- well enough, at least, to overcome all but the most instantly fatal illnesses and accidents. Between twelve and eighty years we gradually lose this power, an illness which at twelve would knock us over, at eighty can knock us out, and into our grave. If we could stay as vigorous as we are at twelve, it would take about 700 years for half of us to die, and another 700 for the survivors to be reduced by half again."	['It refers to a gradual loss of vigor and resistance.']
What do we know about the E-cu phone?	"Batteries are included, but the charger's not. The Nokia E-Cu concept phone doesn't need to plug in, it charges from any heat source. Designer Patrick Hyland says it can even work off the warmth of your pocket. The first time ""it would take approximately seven hours to reach full charge, then after that it's continuously charging by keeping the phone in areas between 86 degrees and 104 degrees Fahrenheit."" That's one hot pocket.? He's put a thermogenerator inside the phone that transforms heat into electric potential energy. To better conduct the heat to that little power plant in your pocket, the E-Cu (E for energy, Cu for copper) is coated by copper backing with heat sinks like those normally used to keep electronics from overheating. Nokia doesn't have current plans to build the phone, so for now it remains a concept. But Hyland says he's open to anyone who wants to cooperate. For Americans this technology would certainly be convenient. It would also save a bit on energy bills and waste. ""Annually, unwanted phone chargers produce 51,000 tons of waste in addition to the greenhouse gases created by the production of the electricity needed to charge them,"" Hyland says. So a charger-free phone is also a green phone. Though adapting our plug in habits would help a group of people, most cell phone related energy use comes from leaving your charger plugged in all day unnecessarily. The real potential for charger-free cell phone technology is what it could enable places where plugging in isn't an option, like rural areas in the developing world. Cell phones are spreading faster than power lines and bringing with them countless opportunities, aid and health advances. A phone like the E-Cu, if it ever comes to be, would enable all manner of expanded aid and development by phone projects. Let's hope Patrick finds a partner."	['It has a highly conductive copper cover.']
When was the first time that Shanghai had to close all the schools?	"Don't you want to go to school? You could tell your parents you're ill. But last Monday, students from Shanghai and Zhejiang had an even better excuse: a typhoon ! Typhoon Khanun hit East China on September 11. In Shanghai, all the school were closed the next day, Monday. It was the first time that Shanghai had to close schools because of bad weather. But some students still came to school that day. "" I didn't get the notice that the school was closing,"" said Shen Sheng, a Junior 2 student from Shanghai Aiguo School. "" But it was nice that we could play in school rather than study."" The school kept Shen and other 20 students safe inside and let them play sports like table tennis. But the storm wasn't all fun games. Typhoon Khanun killed 14 people. In Zhejiang, it _ about 8,000 houses. More than one million people had to be taken to safer places. Every year, typhoons hit different places around the world. Most happen in July, August and September. This year 15 typhoons hit China. Khanun was the strongest. Typhoons bring strong winds and rains. The winds can blow away houses and cars. The rains are bad for farmers' fields. Typhoon also kills people. Earlier this month, Typhoon Talim hit East and Central China. It killed at least 124 people."	['On Sep.12.']

Why are people willing to spend money during Christmas?	Walking down any of Shanghai's main shopping streets this week, newcomers might think the locals have been celebrating Christmas for centuries. Christmas may not be a customary holiday in China, but businessmen in Shanghai know it will bring something more valuable than tradition: people are willing to spend money. Most Chinese may feel little connection with the Christmas celebration, but with most shops offering discount , the message couldn't be clearer-- it is the season to part with one's hard-earned cash. Much of that marketing drive is directed towards thousands of foreigners and foreign companies that call Shanghai home. But for Shanghai's 13 million locals, regardless of personal interest, there seems no avoiding the season's commercial greetings. Along some major roads, nearly every shop window displays some symbols to the holiday: a man-made fir tree with lights, or a snowman. With an increasing number of westerners arriving in the city for work, young Shanghainese, eager to keep pace with the latest western fashions, have begun to show their interest in Christmas. But some people still don't think Christmas is an important festival in China. At least it is less important than the New Year and China's Spring Festival.	['Goods are much cheaper during this period of time.']
Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?	"In Europe, many people make friends between their countries through town twinning. Town or city twinning means two towns in different countries agree and decide to become ""twins"" with a sister-city relationship. The people find pen friends in the twin town. They exchange newspapers and stamps. The school teachers discuss teaching methods with the teachers in the twin town. Officials visit the twin town for celebrations. Ordinary people travel to the twin town, too, but not very often if it is far away. Sometimes, schools even exchange their classes for two or three weeks! For example, German middle school students study for a while at the school in their twin town in Britain, staying with British families. A few months later, their British friends come to study in Germany. Many British towns are so pleased with the results of the twinning that they set out to find more than one twin town! Tonbridge, a small town in Kent, for example, has twin towns in both Germany and France. Richmond near London has relationships with Germany, France and even a town in a Balkan country! Town twinning can help make friends. It helps students improve their language skill, and also helps people to understand the differences between nations."	['Twin towns exchange business skill.']
What do we know about the Imagination Stage?	"As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder. Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage. Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X. Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme. ""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities. One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti. Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."""	"[""It's a cooperative partner of White Oak'S African Club.""]"
According to Sam Kavanagh, _ .	"The 2012 Olympic Games are coming! More than two hundred disabled bikers from thirty-three countries have been competing in Los Angeles, California. They are seeking a chance to compete at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. The games are to open in August after the end of the London Olympics. Here, let's know something about three excellent disabled bikers who will be seen at the 2012 Paralympic Games. American cyclist Jennifer Schuble got hurt in her brain when she was a college student and lost some of the feeling in her feet. Her arm was later damaged in a car accident and she has muscle sclerosis . But she says cycling let her return to competitive sports, ""Doing physical exercise has always been part of my daily life, and every day I play soccer run to keep fit. With cycling, I'm able to strengthen my legs."" She won the gold medal in the five-hundred-meter event at the Beijing Paralympic Games in 2008. Like most of the riders, she has moved beyond her disabilities, dealing with daily life just like everyone else. American Sam Kavanagh lost his leg in a skiing accident seven years ago. After recovering, he returned to cycling which he had enjoyed in college. He says the American team will have a hard time during the competition, "" Great Britain has top athletes in paracycling events. The Americans alwayse come flying. They're very strong. But I have confidence in our team."" British Paralympic champion Sarah Storey was born without a working left hand. She has won gold medals in both cyvling and swimming. She competed in her first games in 1992. She also competed in the Commonwealth Games in 2010 against non-disabled athletes. Sarah Storey says getting ready for the Paralympic Games needs continuous training. She will keep training even after the games."	['the American team will face great challenge']
The author described the Miller's behavior in order to _ .	"Hans was an honest fellow with a funny round good-humored face. Living alone, every day he worked in his garden. In all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his. All sorts of flowers grew there, blooming in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to see, and pleasant odors to smell. Hans had many friends, the most devoted being the Miller. So devoted was the rich Miller to Hans that he'd never go by his garden without plucking a large bunch of flowers or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with fruits. The Miller used to talk about noble ideas, and Hans nodded and smiled, feeling proud of having such a friend. The neighbors thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave Hans anything in return, though he had hundreds of sacks of flour, many cows and sheep, but Hans never troubled his head about these, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things about the unselfishness of true friendship. In spring, summer, and autumn Hans was very happy, but when winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to sell, he suffered from cold and hunger. Though extremely lonely, the Miller never came to see him then. ""There's no good in going to see Hans while the snow lasts."" The Miller said to his wife, ""When people are in trouble they shouldn't be bothered. So I'll wait till the spring comes when he's happy to give me flowers."" ""You're certainly very thoughtful,"" answered his wife, ""It's quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship."" ""Couldn't we ask Hans up here?"" said their son. ""I'll give him half my meal, and show him my white rabbits."" ""How silly you are!"" cried the Miller. ""I really don't know what's the use of sending you to school. If Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, our good supper, and our red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I am his best friend, and I'll always watch over him, and see that he's not led into any temptation. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me for some flour. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they shouldn't be confused. The words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that."" He looked seriously at his son, who felt so ashamed that he hung his head down, and grew quite scared, and began to cry into his tea. Spring coming, the Miller went down to see Hans. Again he talked about friendship. ""Hans, friendship never forgets. I'm afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. See, how lovely your roses are!"" Hans said he wanted to sell them in the market to buy back his things which were sold during the hard time of the winter. ""I'll give you many good things. I think being generous is the base of friendship."" said the Miller. ""And now, as I'll give you many good things, I'm sure you'd like to give me some flowers in return. Here's the basket, and fill it quite full."" Poor Hans was afraid to say anything. He ran and plucked all his pretty roses, and filled the Miller's basket, imagining the many good things promised by the Miller. The next day he heard the Miller calling: ""Hans, would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?"" ""I'm sorry, but I am really very busy today."" ""Well,"" said the Miller, ""considering that I'm going to give you my things, it's rather unfriendly of you to refuse. Upon my word, you mustn't mind my speaking quite plainly to you."" Poor Hans was driven by his friendship theory to work hard for his best friend, leaving his garden dry and wasted. One evening Hans was sitting by fire when the Miller came. ""Hans,"" cried the Miller, ""My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I'm going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it's such a bad windy night. It has just occurred to me that you can go instead of me. You know I'm going to give you my good things, so you should do something for me in return."" ""Certainly,"" cried Hans. He struggled into the stormy night, and got the doctor to ride a horse to the Miller's house in time to save the boy. However, Hans got lost in the darkness, and wandered off into a deep pool, drowned. At Hans' funeral, the Miller said, ""I was his best friend. I should walk at the head of the procession."" Every now and then he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief."	['warn the readers about the danger of a false friend']
The passage is probably taken from _ .	"A 2-year-od boy is being described as a hero after using Face Time to save his mother after she was badly hurt. According to a report from KGUN, Laura was trying to stop a fight between two dogs when one of the dogs bit part of her middle finger almost completely off. Laura tried to call 911 herself, but she said her hands were too badly hurt to make the call. "" I asked my daughters to call 911, and they're four, and they were quite afraid to even touch the phone, because it was covered in my blood ,"" Laura told KGUN. The mother continued to lose a lot of blood and thought she would go into a deep sleep--until her 2-year-old son Bentley came up with a dishcloth from the kitchen. After cleaning some of the bold off his mother's iPhone, Bentley continued to use Face Time to call Laura's friend Connie. ""All I could see was his little forehead. I said 'Hi Bentley' and it was quiet for a little bit. Then I heard Laura shouting,"" Connie told KGUN. Connie then called 911, and Bentley unlocked the door to let firefighters into the house. Laura told KGUN she is very thankful for her little hero and has since taught all of her children how to call 911."	['a newspaper']
From the passage, we know that _ .	"Le Whif, an inhaler that allows chocolate lovers to meet their needs whenever they please without putting on weight, is to be released in British stores. The invention, called the world's first breathable food by its creators, let consumers suck in the taste of chocolate and coffee while taking on less than one calorie. Its makers claim it will enable dieters to enjoy their favorite snacks without worrying about their waistline. The lip-stick-style tube contains hundreds of milligrams of tiny food particles which are small enough to become conveyed by air, but too large to enter the lungs. Each Le Whif contains enough flavor about eight to ten whiffs and costs $1.99 on its own or $4.99 for a pack of three. The inhaler is available in chocolate, raspberry chocolate and mint chocolate models as well as coffee flavor, which gives a dose of caffeine equivalent to a small short of strong black coffee. It was invented by Prof. David Edwards. He said Le Whif was not designed to replace food but could be used to increase dining experience, such as allowing people to sample a variety of dishes from restaurant menus before ordering their meals He said, ""In terms of living off whiffing we aren't even close to being there. But there clearly has been a revolution over the last few years where we are eating smaller amounts of food more frequently, and choosing food or its aesthetic pleasure. We will be launching new whiffing experiences probably every six months. It is reasonable to assume that the next line of whiffing products will be even more health-centered. The product that was released in Paris in 2009 and the initial production run of 25,000 inhalers were sold out within a month. It has since been made available across France and in the US. In Britain Le Whif is to be sold firstly in House of Fraser for a month, after which it could become more widely distributed."	"[""Le Whif hasn't been made available in British stores""]"
Why do elderly people benefit much from the fingerprint machine?	"A new system that scans customers' fingerprints and subtracts the grocery bill from their bank accounts has taken supermarkets in Germany to use the new system. ""Almost a quarter of our customers pay with their fingers,"" said an employee at the headquarters. Edeka has tried the system at 70 of its supermarkets. It says it will introduce it at 200 others because customers like it. ""At first we thought that only the young who really keep up with the latest technology would be interested, but we were wrong,"" said Stefan Sewoester from IT Werke. ""Almost two-thirds of the people who use the system are 40 and older,"" he said. IT Werke, a computer company, is one of the pioneers of fingerprint payment software in Germany. It has helped about 150 shops, canteens and bars to put in the fingerprint scanning machines. Each costs about 2,000 euros. To sign up for the service, customers must have their fingerprints taken and leave their addresses and banking details with the shop. The shop then takes the cost of goods directly out of the customer's bank account. ""It is especially a good thing for elderly people. Now they do not have to remember their pin to pay with their bank cards, or to scratch around for their glasses or cash."" Sewoester said. The stores benefit from the system too. It saves more than time in the check-out line. It also cuts out the hidden costs of accepting electronic card payments."	['They will spend less time on shopping..']
Wood becomes larger because of _ .	"All plant cells are capable of taking up water. Even dead ones do to a certain degree. Absorption of water by dead cell walls makes wood become larger. In common land plants, the living cells of roots take upmost of the water. Land plants without roots do exist, however. Those greenish-yellow lichens you see on rocks in the high mountains have no roots. Half a billion years ago, when water plants started to enter the land, the first land plants did not have roots. Even among the flowering plants, one finds rootless forms. These flowering plants are ""the higher plants"" because they evolved recently and are thus considered higher on the evolutionary scale . In the Peruvian desert, there grows one of these rootless higher plants, a bromeliad. It is a relative of the pineapple. Even if this plant had roots, they would be of no use, because where the plant grows, it never rains. The plant gets its water only from the dew it collects at night, when its leaves cool off. Such rootless plants, of course, can be moved with ease, but they will only grow when they are placed out in the open. If they are placed too near a house, the radiation from the heat of the house prevents the leaves from cooling and so prevents dew from forming, and the plant dies. In the southern United States and in Puerto Rico, one sees growing high above the streets on the insulation of electric wires. These plants get their water from rain, and the only soil they ever come in contact with is the dust that may blow on their leaves."	['water entering dead cells']

Why does the passage say peace and quiet are becoming harder to find?	Scientists believe that one of our most important means of knowing what is going on around us is the sense of sound. We are warned of danger by sounds. Sounds serve to please us in music. Sound has a waste product, too, in the form of noise. Noise has been called unwanted sound. Noise is growing and it may get much worse before it gets any better. In order to know how noise affects people and animals, scientists have been studying for several years. They are surprised by what they have learned. Peace and quiet are becoming harder to find. Noise pollution is a threat that should be looked at carefully. Sounds is measured in units called decibels . At a level of 140 decibels people feel pain in their ears. Trucks , buses , motorcycles, airplanes, boats, factories---all these things make noise. They trouble not only our ears, but minds and bodies as well. There is a saying that it is so noisy that you can't hear yourself think. Doctors who study noise believe that we must sometimes hear ourselves think. If we don't, we may have headaches, other aches and pains, or even worse mental problems. Noise adds more tension to a society that has already faced enough stress.	['Because the world is making more and more noise.']
The passage is mainly about _ .	"Mark felt that it was time for him, to take part in his community, so he went to the neighborhood meeting after work. The area' s city councilwoman was leading a discussion about how the quality of life was decreasing. The neighborhood faced many problems. Mark looked at the charts taped to the walls. There are charts for parking problems, crime, and for problems in vacant buildings. People were supposed to suggest solutions to the councilwoman. It was too much for Mark. ""The problems are too big,"" he thought. He turned to the man next to him and said, ""I think this is a waste of my time. Nothing I could do would make a difference here."" Mark thought some more on his way to the bus stop. ""People should just take care of themselves, ""he decided. ""That' s enough to do. I can' t take on all the problems of the world."" As he neared the bus stop, Mark saw a woman carrying a grocery bag and a baby. She was trying to unlock her car, but she didn't have a free hand. As Mark got closer, her other child, a little boy, suddenly _ into the street. The woman tried to reach for him, but as she moved, her bag shifted and the groceries started to fall out. Mark ran to take the boy's arm and led him back to his mother. Then he picked up the groceries while the woman smiled in relief. ""Thanks! ""she said. ""You've got great timing!"" ""Just being neighborly,"" Mark said. As he rode home, he glanced at the walls of the bus. On one of them was ""Small acts of kindness add up. ""Mark smiled and thought, ""Maybe that's a good place to start."""	['how individuals can help make a difference']
What does the fish in the article stand for?	"WHEN he was 11 years old, he loved fishing in the lake near his family's house in New Hampshire. On the day before bass season began, he and his father went fishing in the evening. He tied a small silver lure on his fishing rod and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused ripples in the black water. When his rod bent over, he knew something huge was on the other end. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully pulled the fish in. Finally, he lifted it from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass. The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10pm --two hours before bass season began. The father looked at the fish, then at the boy. ""You'll have to put it back, son."" he said. ""Dad!"" cried the boy. ""There will be other fish,"" said his father. ""Not as big as this one,"" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around. He looked again at his father's stern face. Even though no one had seen them, the boy knew that the decision was not negotiable .He slowly lowered the fish back into the water. The creature swam away. The boy thought that he would never again see such a great fish. That was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's house is still there by the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing there. He has never again caught such a large fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish again and again---every time he faces a question of right and wrong. His father taught him it is the practice of doing right that is difficult. Do we do right when no one is looking?"	['Right choices.']
Barbara and her friends do the following EXCEPT _ .	"Some couples spend every waking minute together. Others fill their hours with personal hobbies,outside interests and even part-time jobs, just to keep their distance from each other! ""There should be private time and couple time,"" suggests Dr. Stephen Treat at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia.""You don't want your latter years to turn into a process where two people unite as one. If you hold too tightly to your partner, it's going to cause resentment and anger. If you're completely separate, you'll both be lonely and disconnected. You need balance. So you have to talk about how you'll achieve that."" The right balance? It's different for every couple. ""Having a conversation about time can be difficult,but it's important for both partners to process those feelings out loud,"" Dr. Treat says. ""You should not be accusing and act as a judge--ask the difficult questions, but do it in a loving way. You could say something like, 'How are we going to be as individuals and how are we going to be as a couple?' "" Barbara and Chris Christensen have achieved the balance that works for them. In addition to daily routines that keep them close--including about 10 minutes for a daily check-in and about a half hour of relaxation time--they each maintain separate interests and friendships. ""We have found that we need time apart,"" Barbara says. ""I have a group of women friends that I have known for the last 30 years. We have dinner out once a month. We women also have parties and weekend or weeklong vacations as a group at a beach or somewhere.

The young woman asked the hitchhiker to clear the screen because _ .	"A young woman was driving through the lonely countryside. It was dark and raining. Suddenly she saw an old woman by the side of the road, holding her hand out as if she wanted a lift. ""I can't leave her out in this weather,"" the woman said to herself, so she stopped the car and opened the door. ""Do you want a lift?"" she asked. The old woman nodded and climbed into the car. After a while, she said to the old woman, ""Have you been waiting for a long time?"" The old woman shook her head. ""Strange,"" thought the young woman. She tried again. ""Bad weather for the time of year,"" she said. The old woman nodded. No matter what she said, the hitchhiker gave no answer except for a nod of the head or a shrug. Then the young woman noticed the hitchhiker's hands which were large and hairy. Suddenly she realized that the hitchhiker was actually a man! She stopped the car. ""I can't see out of the rear screen,"" she said, ""Would you mind clearing it for me?"" The hitchhiker nodded and opened the door. As soon as the hitchhiker was out of the car, the terrified young woman raced off. When she got to the next village she pulled up. She noticed that the hitchhiker had left his handbag behind. She picked it up and opened it. She gave a gasp; inside the bag was a gun."	['This was the way she thought of to get rid of him']

Now boots are considered _ now.	Women's fashions change more rapidly than men's. In the early 1990's, all women wore their skirts to the ankle. Today, some skirts are even longer than before, but some are very short. Women's shoes have also gone through all sorts of boots for women were very common at the beginning of this century. Then for years, they were not considered fashionable. Today, they're back again in all colours, lengths and materials. In fact, today's women can wear all types of clothes on almost any occasion. While all of these changes were taking place in women's fashions, men's clothing remained almost the same until a few years ago. And, in fact, most men are still dressed in the kinds of clothes they used to wear.	['fashionable']
The purpose of the passage is to _ .	"Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958. He was born in Gary, Indiana. He was the seventh child out of nine children in his family. Michael was often physically abused by his father, beaten up and also verbally abused. But Michael also owed his success to his father's being strict. Michael was always an entertainer . Even when he just joined school, he would perform in front of friends and classmates. Michael started his professional music career at the age of 11, as a member of the Jackson Five. He's well-known for increasing the popularity of MTV through his music videos. Before this, music videos were made just to promote the albums . But Michael's videos managed to change that in videos being made as an art, and for big business. Some of the music videos that are good examples of this fact are Beat It, Billie Jean, and Thriller. Through these works of his, the world got caught onto the idea of music videos and dedicated music video channels. Michael _ his fans and audiences with his style of singing, dressing, and his complex dance moves, especially the ""Moonwalk"". The moonwalk is something that people from every part of the globe loved and try to copy People have also done mass moonwalks all around to show their love towards him. Michael Jackson supported 39 charities . Through his work and various foundations, he raised and gave millions toward charity, much more than any other showman. He had great love for children, especially the poor ones, and he felt children were the next best thing after God. Michael planed to start a 50-concert tour in July 2009. Sadly, on 25thJune, 2009, Michael passed away at home. Michael Jackson was a great performer, showman, and entertainer, besides the good human and charitable person that he was. It's very unlikely that there will ever be another entertainer like Michael Jackson ever again."	['offer readers some facts about Michael Jackson']

"What's ""excerpt"" at the beginning of the passage?"	_ (from How Do Animals Move?) Many animals scurry up tree trunks to escape enemies or find food. Some live in the treetops. Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but they also have found interesting ways to get from tree to tree. How Do Animals Adapt?andHow Do Animals Move? are comprehensive explorations of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a 21 book series,The Science of Living Things. InHow Do Animals Adapt?readers learn how animals adapt to survive with respect not only to climate, darkness, food and defenses but also to offspring and people. These adaptations are well explained in double page spreads with examples clearly depicted in photographs and diagrams and developed through their accompanying captions . As the title suggests, movement is the focus ofHow Do Animals Move?Beginning with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the many different ways of animals movement in the air, on land, under ground and in the water. Several unconventional variations (e.g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear motion of snakes) are included. Once again, the photographs and diagrams plainly support the double page spread discussions of animal movement. The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without talking down to them. In both books, terminology is featured in . Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while the majority are explained clearly in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating, uncommon words (e.g. brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). As do many of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary and index which are all enough to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools. Both titles would make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers.	['A short piece of writing from the books.']
Where is Peter Rabbit hiding?	"""As sure as you're alive now, Peter Rabbit, some day I will catch you,"" shouted Reddy Fox, as he put his black nose in the hole between the roots of the Big Hickory-tree which grows close to the Smiling Pool. ""It is lucky for you that you were not one jump farther away from this hole."" Peter, safe inside that hole, didn't have a word to say, or, if he did, he didn't have breath enough to say it. It was quite true that if he had been one jump farther from that hole, Reddy Fox would have caught him. As it was, the hairs on Peter's funny white tail actually had tickled Reddy's back as Peter ran wildly through the root-bound entrance to that hole. It had been the narrowest escape Peter had had for a long, long time. You see, Reddy Fox had surprised Peter eating sweet clover on the bank of the Smiling Pond, and it had been a lucky thing for Peter that hole, dug long ago by Johnny Chuck's grandfather, had been right where it was. Also, it was a lucky thing that old Mr. Chuck had been wise enough to make the entrance between the roots of that tree in such a way that it could not be dug any larger. Reddy Fox was too shrewd to waste any time trying to dig it larger. He knew there wasn't room enough for him to get between those roots. So, after trying to make Peter as uncomfortable as possible by telling him what he, Reddy, would do to him when he did catch him, Reddy walked across the Green Meadows. Peter remained where he was for a long time. When he was quite sure that it was safe to do so, he crawled out and hurried to the Old Orchard. He felt that that would be the safest place for him, because there were ever so many hiding places in the old stone wall along the edge of it."	['In a hole']
The dog was very _ when his master came back from hunting.	"More than seven hundred years ago, the Prince of Wales had a very big and brave dog called Gelert. One day the Prince wanted to go hunt-ing with his men. He told his dog to stay at home and look after his baby son. The baby was in a wooden cradle, which was like a small bed. When the Prince came back from hunt-ing, Gelert ran out to meet his master. He wagged his tail and jumped up to put his paws on the Prince's chest. Then the Prince saw the blood on Gelert's jaws and head. ""What have you done?"" the Prince said. He rushed into his house and looked for his baby son. The cradle was lying on its side on the floor. The clothes were torn and there was blood on them. ""So you have killed my son?"" the Prince said angrily. ""You unfaithful dog!"" He took out his sword and killed the dog. Just as Gelert was dying, he managed to bark. Then the Prince heard a baby call to the dog. The Prince ran out of the house and saw his son lying on the ground unhurt. Near him was a dead wolf. Then the Prince knew that Gelert had defended the baby and killed the wolf. The Prince ran back into the house but he was too late. Gelert was dead. The Prince was very sad indeed. Tears ran down his face when he realized 'he had killed his faith-ful friend. The Prince carried the body of his brave dog to the top of a mountain and buried him there. After this, the Prince never smiled again. Every morning at dawn, he walked up the mountain and stood by the dog's grave for a few minutes. If you go to Mount Snowdon in Wales, people will show you where Gelert is buried. There is a sign by his grave. It reminds peo-ple of a brave and faithful dog."	['glad']
What's the common problem that new moms don't face?	The constant demands, together with the exhausting effects of interrupted sleep, can make it hard to find the time and energy to exercise or prepare healthy meals. Here are some tips for common problems new moms face: Problem: No time to cook proper meals. When you're caring for a baby, cooking proper meals seems like a luxury. Instead you rely on convenience meals and processed foods. Solution: Try to get more support. Friends, family members, and neighbors are often delighted to help, so don't feel you have to do everything yourself. Use the extra time to prepare some healthy meals. Follow the basic rules of cutting down on fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Problem: Sugary or high-fat snacks. Tiredness can leave you feeling sleepy, run-down, and in need of an immediate help from sweets and high-fat snacks. Solution: Turn snacking to your advantage. Eat high-fiber, low-fat, low-sugar snacks; these will fill you up without adding too many calories. For an energy boost, eat a banana, which is high in potassium -- a mineral essential for muscle and nerve function -- or try a handful of raisins , which are high in iron but low in fat. Problem: No time or energy to exercise. A baby is a constant demand on your time, so you're too tired or busy to exercise. Solution: Increasing activity levels will help you obtain a net calorie loss, while toning exercises will tighten your muscles. Though you may feel too tired to do any exercise, it is worth persevering (,) because in the long run your energy levels will increase. Involve your baby in your postnatal exercises; start by walking with the child in a carriage or sling(;). Swimming is another aerobic exercise that you can both enjoy by joining a mother and baby class. Many pools have childcare facilities, so you can swim a few laps on your own. Problem: Lack of sleep. The new baby interrupts your sleep, _ your energy and leaving you tense and exhausted. Solution: Practice some relaxation techniques whenever you have a few free moments. Meditation, visualization, or yoga can help your body recover and give you more energy.	['Sleeping too long can make them fat.']
What's the passage mainly about?	"Astronaut Zhai Zhigang became the first Chinese man to walk in space on Saturday, climbing out of prefix = st1 /China's Shenzhou VII spacecraft in a technological feat that made the Chinese people excited. ""I'm feeling quite well. I greet the Chinese people and the people of the world,"" Zhai said as he climbed out of the craft at around 16:40 Beijingtime, a historic achievement telecast live on CCTV. Tens of millions of Chinese viewers gathered before TV screens to watch the moment. Chinese President Hu Jintao and other top leaders had appeared at the BeijingAerospaceControlCenterto watch the live transmission of Zhai's spacewalk. Zhai, 42, chosen by an expert team for the first ""extra-vehicular activity"". unveiled a red national flag, helped by colleague Liu Boming, who also briefly popped his head out of the capsule. Zhai slowly made his way towards a test sample of solid lubricant outside the capsule, took a sample and handed it to Liu. Zhai safely returned inside the craft after about 20 minutes. The walk marked the high point of China's third manned space journey, which has received widespread media coverage. Zhai wore a$4.4 million Chinese-made suit weighing 120kg. Liu wore a Russian-made one and acted as a back-up. The third crew member, Jing Haipeng, monitored the ship from inside the re-entry module. The risky manoeuvre is a step towards China's longer-term goal of assembling a space lab and then a larger space station, analysts said. ""On this flight, Chinese people's footprints will be left in space for the first time,"" said a commentary by the Xinhua News Agency. The astronauts embarked on their walk after receiving a clean bill of health from doctors on the ground at mission control in Beijing, Xinhua said. Zhai's suit has 10 layers and takes up to 15 hours to assemble and put on. China's first manned spaceflight was in 2003. A second, two-manned flight followed in 2005. The only other countries that have sent people into space are Russiaand theUnited States."	['A Chinese astronaut takes historic walk in space.']
What is a shortcoming of Armstrong's work according to the author?	This brief book is aimed at high school students, but speaks to anyone learning at any stage of life. Its formal, serious style closely matches its content, a school-masterly book on schooling.The author, W.H.Armstrong, starts with the basics: reading and writing.In his opinion, reading doesn't just mean recognizing each word on the page; it means taking in the information, digesting it and incorporating it into oneself just as one digests a sandwich and makes it a part of himself.The goal is to bring the information back to life, not just to treat it as dead facts on paper from dead trees.Reading and writing cannot be completely separated from each other; in fact, the aim of reading is to express the information you have got from the text.I've seen it again and again:some-one who can't express an idea after reading a text is just as ineffective as someone who hasn't read it at all. Only a third of the book remains after that discussion, which Armstrong devotes to specific tips for studying languages, math, science and history.He generally handles these topics thoroughly and equally, except for some weakness in the science and math sections and a bit too much passion regarding history to his students, that was a hundred times more than my history teachers ever got across.To my disappointment, in this part of the book he ignores the arts.As a matter of fact, they demand all the concentration and study that math and science do, though the study differs slightly in kind.Although it's commonly believed that the arts can only be naturally acquired, actually, learning the arts is no more natural than learning French or mathematics. My other comment is that the text aged.The first edition apparently dates to the 1960s--none of the references seem newer than the late 1950s.As a result, the discussion misses the entire computer age. These are small points, though, and don't affect the main discussion.I recommend it to any student and any teacher, including the self-taught student.	['It lacks new information']
The observation of weather conditions by satellites is advantageous because _ .	"A weather map is an important tool for geographers. A succession of three or four maps presents a continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts to determine whether an individual pressure area is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity. They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a synoptic picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time. All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately. Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts, droughts, and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day ""outlook"" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an analysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for the development of air masses, fronts, and storms. Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions. With the use of electronic instruments and earth satellites, enormous gains have taken place recently in identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological stations . Extensive experiments are also in progress for weather modification studies. But the limitations of modification have prevented meteorological results except in the seeding of super-cooled, upslope mountainous winds which have produced additional orographic precipitation on the windward side of mountain ranges. Nevertheless, they have provided a clearer understanding of the fundamentals of weather elements."	['information not obtained readily otherwise can be gained']

"From the passage we can infer that Kissinger's cable carrying the message ""Eureka"" must have been sent _ ."	"We arranged that Kissinger would fly to Vietnam early in July and then stop in Pakistan on the way back. There he would develop a stomachache that would require him to stay in bed and not be seen by the press. Then, with President Yapha's help, he would be taken to the airport where a Pakistani jet would fly him over the mountains to China. Kissinger's trip was given the name Polo after Marco Polo, another Western traveler who made history by journey in China. Everything went quite smoothly. His slight illness in Islamabad received only small attention from reporters covering him. They accepted the story that he would be kept shut up for at least a few days and began making arrangements for their own activities. Because of the need for complete secrecy and the lack of any direct communication facilities between Beijing and Washington, I knew that we would have no word from Kissinger while he was in China. Even after he had returned to Pakistan, it would still be important to keep it secret, so before Kissinger left, we agreed on a single code word - Eureka - which he would use if his missions were successful and the presidential trip had been arranged. On July 11, Al Haig, who knew our code work, phoned to say that a cable from Kissinger had arrived. ""What's the message?"" I asked. ""Eureka"". he replied."

The main reason why people lie about reading is to _ .	"It happened to me recently that I was telling someone how much I had enjoyed reading Barack Obama's Dreams From My Father and how it had changed my views of the current US President. The person I was talking to agreed with me that it was, in his words, ""a wonderfully written book."" However, he then _ to talk about Mr. Obama in a way that suggested he had no idea of his background at all. I sensed that I was talking to a book liar . And it seems that he is not the only one. Clearly two thirds of people have lied about reading a book which they haven't. In The World Book Day survey, Dreams From My Father is at number 9. The survey lists top ten books, and various authors, which people have lied about reading. As I'm not one to lie too often, I'll admit here and now that I haven't read the entire ten books. But I am pleased to say that I have read the book at number one, George Orwell's 1984. I think it's absolutely outstanding. Asked why they lied, the most common reason was to impress someone they were speaking to. This could be difficult if the conversation became more in-depth! The World Book Day survey also has some other interesting information in it. It shows that many people lie about having read classical works by Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Charles Dickens and so on. But when asked which authors they actually enjoy, they named JK Rowling, Jilly Cooper, and Stephen King. Forty-one percent of people asked admitted they turned to the back of the book to read the end before finishing the story. So which books have you lied about reading --if any -- and which is your favorite?"	['impress the listener']
What can we learn from the passage?	Homelessness is a huge problem all over the world. It's said that each day there are about 1 million people living on the streets in the US. It is a serious problem which should be dealt with effectively. There are two main reasons for people leaving their homes: poverty and less affordable houses due to bad economic conditions. Other reasons include: domestic violence, divorce, and mental illness. Living without a home makes people main targets of violence activities and besides, these homeless people have to face the following difficulties on a daily basis. They have to move about, carrying their belongings, which makes it difficult for the charity and the government to help them. They have limited access to bathrooms and restrooms and are forced to live in dirty conditions, making them easy to be attacked by diseases. They have limited access to health-care facilities in case of emergency, and almost no access to education as they have no money. They are often ill-treated by society, which makes them unfriendly, often ending up being involved in activities connected with crime like selling drugs or guns. Homelessness is not something that happened overnight --- it has been in the country for decades. The society usually believes those living on the street to be mentally unstable. This belief is partially true. Most of them are normal people just like you and me. The federal government is doing all it can to help but it is not enough, so the ordinary citizens have to stand up and try to help whenever it's possible. There are various organizations, such as charity organizations that are working constantly to make sure that homeless people find a shelter to live in. the united efforts have helped millions of people return to their normal lifestyle. However, there is still a long way to go before a better situation is created for all the homeless.	['The homeless problem is a serious problem that need solving effectively.']
Supermarket managers make the food attractive so _ .	"People in cities all over the world shop in supermarkets. When you enter the supermarket, you see shelves full of food. You walk in the aisles, pushing your shopping cart. You probably hear soft, slow music in the supermarket. This kind of music is playing to relax you and make you walk slowly. Thus, you will probably stay longer and buy more food. Where do you go in the supermarket when you first arrive? Many people go to the meat section first. This area of the store has many different kinds of meat. Some kinds are expensive and others are not. Usually, some kinds of meat are on sale. So it has a special low price. The manager of the store knows where the customers usually enter the meat section. The meat on sale is usually at the other end of the section, away from where the customers enter. If you want to buy this specially priced meat, you have to walk by the more expensive meat first. Maybe you will see something that you want to buy before you reach the cheaper, inexpensive meat. Then you will spend more money in the meat section. The diary section sells milk that is low in fat. Some supermarkets sell three different containers of low-fat milk. Each container looks different, but each contains the same product. One says ""1% fat"", one says ""99% fat free"" and one says ""low-fat"" in big letters and ""1%""in very small letters. If you look carefully you can see that all the milk has the same amount of fat, and each container is the same size. The prices of all these three should be the same. However, in many stores these three containers of milk would each have a different price. The store will make more money if a customer chooses the milk that costs the most. Most of the food in supermarkets is very attractive. People often stop to look at the products in attractive containers. But remember, many products will say, ""Buy me!"". Stop and think which ones are the best value for your money."	['the customers will buy more']
Monarch butterflies lay eggs _ .	Many animals go on long and difficult journeys to find food or places for their young to start life. They often travel very far, sometimes even halfway around the world. Some animals make one of these amazing journeys every year, while others make only one amazing journey in their lives. Some animals travel over land, some through water and others in the air. Green turtles spend most of their lives in the sea, but they come to the shore to lay their eggs. Every two or three years, fully-grown female turtles swim a long way to the same beach where they were hatched and lay their eggs there. Some turtles may travel over 1240 miles to reach the same beach. No one knows how these turtles are able to find the same beach again. Monarch butterflies live in North America. At the end of summer, they fly south to Mexico. In spring, they fly back north. During this journey, the adults lay their eggs and then they die. When the young butterflies hatch, they continue the journey north. No one knows how the young butterflies know where to go.	['on the way from Mexico to North America']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"A year ago, I paid no attention to English idioms, though my teacher stressed the importance again and again. But soon, the importance of English idioms was shown in an amusing experience. One day, I happened to meet an Englishman on the road, and soon we began to talk. As I was talking about how I was studying English, the foreigner seemed to be astonished. Gently shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders, he said, ""You don't say!"" ""You don't say!"" I was puzzled. I thought, perhaps this is not a proper topic. ""Well, I'd better change the topic."" So I said to him, ""Well, shall we talk about the Great Wall? By the way, have you ever been there?"" ""Certainly, everyone back home will laugh at me if I leave China without seeing it. It was wonderful."" He was deep in thought when I began to talk like a tourist guide. ""The Great Wall is one of the wonders in the world. We are very proud of it"". Soon I was interrupted again by his words:""You don't say!"" I couldn't help asking, ""Why do you ask me not to talk about it?"" ""Well, I didn't request you to do so,"" he answered, greatly surprised. I said, ""Didn't you say 'you don't say'?"" Hearing this, the Englishman laughed to tears. He began to explain, ""'You don't say' actually means 'really?' It is an expression of surprise. Perhaps you don't pay attention to English idioms."" Only then did I know I had made a fool of myself. Since then I have been more careful with idiomatic expressions. Always remember: what the English teachers say is always right to us students."	['The Englishman visited the Great Wall and thought it worth visiting.']
What makes the young people feel happiest nowadays in America accord-ing to the passage?	"So you're beween the ages of 13 and 24.What makes you happy?

It turns out the real answer is quite different Spending time with family is the top answer to that open-ended question,according to an extensive sur-vey--more than 100 questions asked of 1,280 people aged 13-24--conducted by The Associated Press and MTV on the nature of happiness among America's young people. Next is spending time with friends,follwed by time with a significant other.And even better for parents:Nearly three quarters of young people say their relationship with their parents makes them happy. ""They're my foundation,""says Kristiana St.John,17,a high-school stu-dent from Queens in New York.""My mom tells me that even if I do something stupid,she's still going to love me no matter what.Just knowing that makes me feel very happy and blessed."" You might thik money would be cleauly tied to a general sense of happi-ness.But almost no one says""money"" when asked what makes them happy,though people with the highest family incomes are generally happier with life.However,having highly educated parents is a stronger predictor of happiness than income. From the body to the soul:Close to half say religion and spirituality are very important.And more than half say they believe there is a higher power that has an influence over things that make them happy.Beyond religion religion,simply belonging to an organized relious group makes people happier. And parents,here's some more for you:Most young people in school say it makes them happy.Overwhelingly ,young people think mar-riage would make them happy and want to be married some day,Most also want to have kids. Finally,when asked to name their heroes,nearly half of respondents men-tioned one or both of their parents.The winner,by a nose:Mom."	['Earning a lot of money.']

What do you think of the dog according to the passage?	Nancy was new to America. She had an 8-year-old son. They found a house in New York. They were there for only two months when a neighbor's dog jumped into their yard. The dog ran toward Nancy's son. Nancy put her body in between the dog and her son. The dog stopped when it saw Nancy standing in front of it. She was going to hit it on the nose. The dog turned around. Shaking, Nancy took her son upstairs. They stayed in the house all the weekend. Then Nancy found another house. It was close to her son's school. She and her son walked everywhere. They found there was a park and a supermarket near the house. Nancy was very happy. Her son Tommy liked playing badminton, and he could practice in the park every morning.	['A little scary.']
What is the best title for the passage?	"There was once a rabbit who thought the more friends she had, the better. So she made many friends. She even thought she was the most popular animal in the world. One day the rabbit heard hounds baying not far from her. Usually, she hurried away at the first sound of a baying dog. But this time she didn't want to run for her life as before. ""I have so many friends, and they could help me,"" she thought. She decided to ask one of them to carry her to safety. The rabbit asked the horse, ""Please, dear friend, will you carry me away from the hounds?"" The horse answered, ""I wish I could help you, but I have work to do for my owner."" Then the rabbit asked the cow for help. The cow answered, ""I wish I could help you, but it's almost milking time."" The goat had something important to do, too. So were the sheep and the pig. Every animal the rabbit asked for help seemed to be _ . Even the calf had no time for her. Each of her friends said, ""I wish I could help you."" But all of them had some excuse that prevented them from helping her. Sadly, the rabbit said to herself, ""I have so many friends in the world, but why don't they help me when I'm in danger?"" By this time, the hounds were getting closer. The rabbit didn't have any time to think. She was forced to run for her life. She quickly took off and, luckily, escaped just in time."

We can guess from the story _ .	"A sunflower is a sunflower. A mobile phone is a mobile phone. But can you combine the two to do something for your local environment? As early as next year it may well be possible. When you have finished with your mobile phone you will be able to bury it in the garden and wait for it to flower . A biodegradable mobile phone was, this month, introduced by scientists. It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals. British researchers used the new material to develop a phone cover that includes a sunflower seed .When this new type of cover turns into waste, it forms nitrates . These feed the seed and help the flower grow. Engineers have designed a small transparent window to hold the seed. They have made sure it only grows when the phone is thrown away. ""We've only put sunflower seeds into the cover so far. But we are working with scientists to find out which flowers would perform best. Maybe we could put roses in next time."" said one scientist. As phone technology is developing so quickly, people are constantly throwing their mobiles away. This means producers are under pressure to find ways of recycling them. Some 650 million mobile phones have been sold this year. Most of them will be thrown away within two years, adding plastic, heavy metal and chemical waste to the environment. A biodegradable cover can change this, according to the scientists. ,A, B, C, D,. (10)"	['the new type of mobile phones will sell very well']
Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?	"""Plants were expected to get larger with increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but changes in temperature, humidity and nutrient availability seem to have _ the benefits of increased carbon dioxide,"" said researchers from the National University of Singapore. 45 percent of the species studied now reach smaller adult sizes than they did in the past. The researchers point out that warmer temperatures and changing habitats, caused by climate change, are possible reasons for the shrinking of creatures. ""We do not yet know the exact mechanisms involved, or why some organisms are getting smaller while others are unaffected,"" the researchers said. ""Until we understand more, we could be risking negative consequences that we can't yet quantify."" The change was big in cold-blooded animals. Only two decades of warmer temperatures were enough to make reptiles smaller. An increase of only 1degC caused nearly a 10 percent increase in metabolism . Greater use of energy resulted in tiny tortoises and little lizards. Fish are smaller now too. Though overfishing has played a part in reducing numbers, experiments show that warmer temperatures also stop fish growth. There is a recent report on warmer temperatures' negative effects on plankton ,the base of the marine ecosystem. Warm-blooded animals weren't immune from the size change caused by climate change. Many birds are now smaller; Mammals have been miniaturized too. Soay sheep are thinner. Red deer are weaker. And polar bears are smaller, compared with historical records. This isn't the first time this has happened in Earth's history. 55 million years ago, a warming event similar to the current climate change caused bees, spiders and ants to shrink by 50 to 75 percent over several thousand years. That event happened over a longer time than the current climate change. The speed of modern climate change could mean organisms may not respond or adapt quickly enough, especially those with long generation times. So, it is likely that more negative influences of climate change will be shown in the future."	['Species become smaller as climate warms']
In the last few days before Addwaita died, he _ .	"CALCUTTA, India Mar 24, 2006 (AP) -- One of the world's oldest creatures, a giant tortoise believed to have been about 250 years old, has died in the Calcutta zoo where it spent more than half its long life. Addwaita, which means ""the one and only"" in the local Bengali language, was one of four Aldabra tortoises brought to India by British sailors in the 18th century. Zoo officials say he was a gift for Lord Robert Clive of the East India Company, who was instrumental in establishing British colonial rule in India, before he returned to England in 1767. Long after the other three tortoises died, Addwaita continued to thrive , living in Clive's garden before being moved to the zoo in 1875. ""According to records in the zoo, the age of the giant tortoise, Addwaita, who died on Wednesday, would be about 250 years,"" said zoo director Subir Chowdhury. That would have made him much older than the world's oldest documented living animal: Harriet, a 176-year-old Galapagos tortoise who lives at the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane, according to the zoo's Web site. She was taken from the island of Isla Santa Cruz by Charles Darwin in the 19th century. Aldabra tortoises come from the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelle islands in the Indian Ocean, and often live to more than 100 years of age. Males can weigh up to 550 pounds. Addwaita, the zoo's biggest attraction, had been unwell for the last few days, said local Forest Minister Jogesh Burman. ""We were keeping a watch on him. When the zoo keepers went to his enclosure on Wednesday they found him dead,"" Burman said."	['had been found not better than before']

What can we learn from the passage ?	"In today's congratulatory phone call to the team behind NASA's Mars Curiosity rover , President Barack Obama made sure that if the mission discovers Martians, he'll be one of the first to know. ""If in fact you do make contact with Martians, please let me know right away,"" Obama said during the call, ""I've got a lot of things on my plate, but I expect that that will go to the top of the list. Even if they're just microbes , it will be pretty exciting."" Obama also said he was impressed by the attention that's been paid to flight director Bobak Ferdowsi, the ""Mohawk Guy"" whose star-spangled haircut and warmhearted behavior during Curiosity's Aug. 5 landing won him Internet fame. ""I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself,"" Obama joked. ""But my team keeps on discouraging me. And now that he's received marriage proposals and thousands of new Twitter followers, I think I'm going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense."" The congratulatory phone call is a tradition for the White House. But it was clear that Obama particularly enjoyed congratulating the scientists and engineers behind the amazingly successful landing of NASA's newest Mars exploration. He also said the achievement reflected the American spirit, and he gave his personal promise to protect these critical investments in science and technology. ""This is the kind of thing that inspires kids across the country,"" he said. ""They're telling their moms and dads they want to be part of a Mars mission, maybe even the first person to walk on Mars. And that kind of inspiration is the byproduct of work of the sort that you guys have done."" The Curiosity rover's $2.5 billion mission focuses on studying billions of years' worth of geology on Mars and determining whether the planet was ever potentially suitable for people to live in. The mission is not specifically designed to explore life, even on the range of microbes, but it could point the way for future life-exploration experiments."

According to the passage, such animals as fish and chickens can turn into _ .	"Babies love chocolate and sometimes they also eat the paper around it. My cat enjoys a meal of goods, thick paper and letters, for example. She doesn't like newspapers very much. Of course, the best paper comes from wood. Wood comes from trees, and trees are plants. Vegetables and fruit are plants too, and we eat a lot of them. So can we also eat wood and paper? Scientists say, ""All food comes in some way from plants."" Well, is that true? Animals eat grass and grow fat. Then we eat their meat. Little fish eat little sea plants; then bigger fish swim along and eat them. Chickens eat bits of grass and give us meat. Think for a minute. What food does not come from plants in some way? Scientists can do wonderful things with plants. They can make food just like meat and cheese. And they can make it without the help of animals. Now they have begun to say, ""We make our paper from wood. We can also make food from wood. The next thing is not very difficult."" What is the next thing? Perhaps it is food from paper. Scientists say, ""We can turn paper into food. It will be good, cheap food too; cheaper than meat or fish or eggs."" So please keep your old books and letters. Don't feed them to your cat. One day, soon they will be on your plate. _ ."	['meat']
What is true with the ice hotel?	A winter wonderland on the outskirts of Quebec City has become one of Canada's hottest attractions and most sought out accommodations. Guests stay close for warmth in sleeping bags on beds of ice, hats pulled over their ears to prevent frostbite, while sipping cocktails in glasses also made of ice. A cool place to host a memorable wedding or for a romantic getaway, the Quebec Ice Hotel has attracted 600,000 curious tourists, including 30,000 who stayed overnight, since opening seasonally 11 years ago. Like Victoria and Jeremy Martin, dozens of couples will exchange vows this winter in a temporary church next to the hotel, made entirely from blocks of ice with seats covered in furs. Average temperatures fall below minus 20 degrees C (minus four F) in winter, but inside the hotel's 36 rooms it is relatively comfortable. Thick walls of packed snow and ice act as an _ , trapping body heat inside. Each room is uniquely decorated, using designs created by Quebec architecture students. Two hotel bars also sell special cocktails in ice glasses. First-time guests of the hotel, however, are recommended to stay only one night as sleeping in sub-zero temperatures is not very refreshing. This year for the first time the ice hotel has teamed up with a brick and concrete Quebec City hotel to offer packages for one-night accommodations at each. Prices for one night only at the ice hotel start at 200 US dollars per person. The 3,000-square-metre (32,300-square-feet) buildings take six weeks starting in December to build, using 15,000 tons of snow and 500 tons of ice, at a cost of some 750,000 US dollars. Eleven weeks after its seasonal grand opening, the hotel will close on March 27 and then melt away with the arrival of spring.	['Wedding ceremonies are often held there.']
Brazil slows deforestation rate because Brazil .	"Large areas of the Amazon rainforest were grassland until just 2,000 years ago when it has been found. Researchers say the find gives new light on the Amazon's history - and show it was a savannah rather than the high forest it is today. They believe much of the area was grassland until a natural shift to a wetter climate about 2,000 years ago let the rainforests form, according to a study that challenges common belief that the world's biggest tropical forest is far older. The arrival of European diseases after Columbus crossed the Atlantic in 1492 may also have sped up the growth of forests by killing the local people farming the region, the scientists wrote in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). ""The dominant ecosystem was more like a savannah than the rainforest we see today,"" John Carson, lead author at the University of Reading in England, said of the findings about the southern Amazon. The scientists said that a shift toward wetter conditions, perhaps caused by natural shifts in the Earth's orbit around the sun, led to growth of more trees starting about 2,000 years ago. The ""findings suggest that rather than being rainforest hunter-gatherers, or large-scale forest clearers, the people of the Amazon from 2,500 to 500 years ago were farmers,"" the University of Reading said in a statement. Carson said that perhaps a fifth of the Amazon basin, in the south, may have been savannah until the shift, with forests covering the rest. In one lake, Laguna Granja, rainforest plants only took over from grass as the main sources of sediments about 500 years old, suggesting a link to the arrival of Europeans. And understanding the forest could help solve puzzles about climate change. The Amazon rainforest affects climate change because trees soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they rot or are burnt. Brazil has sharply slowed deforestation rates in recent years."	['intends to help prevent global warming']
What does the text mainly talk about?	There is little doubt that house cat first developed naturally from ancient wild cats. The cleverest relative is the America wild cat which still lives in Africa today. This is understandable because the first house cats came from Africa. Cats first started to live around people in Egypt about 6,000~7,000 years ago. From Egypt, cats started to move around the world. This is about the same time that Egyptians began storing grain in buildings. Scientists used to believe that people _ cats to catch mice and protect the grain. However, cats don't like to be told what to do! Now, scientists believed that cats followed the mice and learned to accept people. Finally, some of the cats began to grow comfortable around people, these were smaller cats that needed protection. As these cats and people got used to each other, then they moved in together. Around 5,000 years ago, cats started to live with people. Soon cats were in Greece, then the Middle East and China. They moved along Egyptian business roads keeping away mice and keeping people around them. After the Romans came to Egypt, they also accepted the cats and brought them to Europe. These cat likely bred with other cats to form the many kinds of house cats we have today. Cats are relatively recent house animals. House cats still have a lot in common with their wild relatives. Cats sleep a lot to save energy just like wild cats. They will often get food at night as well. House cats are generally peaceful and friendly, but be careful! If a cat feels it is in danger, it will fight back--just like a wild cat. .	['The development of house cats.']

Make a decision not to hold back in conversations,What you have to say is just as important as what other people say.And don't turn down party invitations just because of your shyness. Prepare yourself for being with others in groups.Make a list of the good qualities you have.Then make a list of ideas,experiences,and skills you would like to share with other people. Think about what you would like to say in advance.Then say it. If you start feeling self-conscious in a group,take a deep breath and focus your attention on other people.Remember, you are not alone.Other people are concerned about the impression they are making,too. No one ever gets over being shy completely, but most people do learn to live with their shyness. Even entertainers admit that they often feel shy.They work at fighting their shy feelings so that they can face the cameras and the public.Just making the effort to control shyness can have many rewards.But perhaps the best reason to fight shyness is to give other people a chance to know more about you.

What does the writer of this article imply about 3-D printing?	"Printing images is easy. Just select an image of a purple robot on your PC, for example, and press print. Your home printer exactly shoots drops of ink onto a flat piece of paper, creating the robot's 2-D image. ""Printing"" 3-D objects is different. Take the purple robot. First select a file of the 3-D printer. Immediately, the printer begins making noise, and a nozzle releases plastic material in thin layers. In two or three hours, a 3-D purple robot is standing before you. 3-D printing has developed to the point where printers can now create high-quality objects using a variety of materials, including metals. That means 3-D printers can now make final products that meet high industrial standards. 3-D printers are already being used to make parts for racecars and jets as well as man-made limbs and hearing aids. So far, few homes have 3-D printers. That's because 3-D printing is not only new to most people but also quite expensive. To bring 3-D printing to the masses, some retail stores plan to offer the service. For example, the Staples chain of office supply stores has announced that it will offer 3-D printing in Europe beginning in 2013. Customers will be able to submit their own 3-D designs to Staples website for printing. After the job is done, they'll pick up their item at a nearby Staples store or have it mailed to their homes. This service is sure to encourage many more people to try out 3-D printing."	['Its future looks bright.']
What's the problem of the hotel?	I'm going to have a great weekend. I'll go across Canada with my parents by car. We'll drive seven or eight hours a day. In Toronto, we'll stay in a big hotel. The food is very delicious. There's a big swimming pool and a lot of game rooms. I think I'll play there happily. But there'll be lots of people in the hotel, so I think we'll sleep in one room. And it's expensive. Then we are going to stay in a small cabin in the mountains. I really love it. The cabin is clean and quiet. We'll have two rooms, so I can get up late in the morning. But we have to get up early because we want to go swimming. There is a beautiful lake near the cabin. We also can go fishing and cook food outside.	"[""There aren't enough  rooms for them.""]"

With each lightning, the little girl stopped, looked up and smiled. Inside the car, the motherasked her daughter, ""What were you doing? Why did you look up and smile when the lightning came ?"" The little girl answered with a smile, ""Mum, you know, God was looking at me. Each time I felt a little afraid walking in the rain.God would take a picture of me.

What is important for good sight at night?	"Vitamins are complex chemical substances found in many foods. The human body needs them for health and growth. The body makes some vitamins, but usually in amounts too small to meet its needs. Other vitamins are not made in the body. These must be supplied. No one knows exactly how all vitamins work. Doctors do know that vitamins have very special uses. One vitamin therefore cannot take the place of another. The steady absence of one vitamin in an otherwise complete diet causes a deficiency disease. Rickets, scurvy, and pellagra are examples of deficiency diseases. It is best to obtain vitamins by eating the foods in which they occur. There are also pills that contain a single vitamin or a combination of vitamins people should consult their doctors before they take any vitamin pills. Scientists have discovered about 25 vitamins and their different forms that are very important to human beings and other forms of life. Experts believe that there are many more vitamins to be discovered. There are two basic groups of vitamins. One group of vitamins dissolves in fat and is therefore called the ""fat-soluble"" group. Vitamins A, D, E and K are in this group. The other group is known as ""water-soluble"" vitamins. These vitamins, understandably, dissolve in water. Among this group are Vitamin C and the B group of vitamins. Vitamin A aids the building and growth of body cells. This vitamin is therefore vital for the growth of children and for good development of babies before birth. Vitamin A is also important for good vision at night. Vitamin B1 is also called thiamine. This vitamin prevents and cures disease. Vitamin B2, called riboflavin, is needed for growth, healthy skin, and for the eyes. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, prevents and cures scurvy. Vitamin D is a group of 10 vitamins that prevents rickets. Scientist believe that Vitamin D3 forms in the skin when the body is exposed to sunlight. Because of this, it is called the ""sunshine vitamin"". A lack of Vitamin D may lead to bone damage; too much may cause kidney disease. All of the functions of Vitamin E, also called tocopherol, are not known. It is necessary for reproduction in animals. Vitamin K is necessary for making the blood clot. The more that is learned about vitamins, the more it is realized how these chemical substances play a part in all aspects of human activity."	['Vitamin A']
What is EF Education?	"The English proficiency of Chinese women is much better than that of men, according to a study released in Shanghai yesterday, Chinese women scored three points higher than men in the English Proficiency Index released by EF Education, a language training company, mainly English. Worldside, women scored one point higher than men on average. ""This shows that Chinese women are more used to the Chinese education mode, the report said. Chinese women use their gift of language to gain success."" However, Chinese mainlanders English proficiency ranked second to last in Asia, despite the great time and effort that many people invest in learning the language, the report said, China's mainland is ranked the 36th in the index of 54 countries and regions where English is not the native language. That's down by seven places comparing with that last year. The Chinese mainland belongs to the low-proficiency tier and is ranked just above Thailand in Asia. This year's index has increased the weight of listening tests, while decreasing the importance of grammar and vocabulary exams, which partly caused the ranking change, researchers said. Moreover, test-oriented and rote-based learning methods often used in China hurt the language skills of Chinese students, education experts said. The study compared test scores of more than 1.7 million adults in the 54 countries and regions. Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have the best command of English, while Libya has the lowest English proficiency level. European countries generally performed well. But Italy, Spain and Portugal, some of the countries at the heart of the euro zone crisis, are being dragged down by poor English, according to the report. Singapore is 12th, the best in Asia, followed by Malaysia and India, South Korea; at 21st, and Japan, at 22nd, performed disappointingly low despite their focus on education; the report said. One in every four people frequently uses English at work on China's mainland, nevertheless nearly 15 percent said they never use English, lower than the world average level, according to the study.[:Z,xx,k.Com]"	['It is a language training company.']
What is the main idea of the passage?	"Having crossed mountains and plains, rivers and lakes, some of prefix = st1 /France's greatest works of art are now on display atChina's National Museum of fine Arts. Fifty-one Impressionist paintings are forming part of an exhibition inBeijingto kick off the Year of France. The show is being held in the capital between October 10 and November 27. Then it will move on to Shanghai and Hong Kong. ""It is such a good opportunity to see the masters' works up close,"" said Feng Jiajia, a Senior student form the High School Affiliated to theAcademyofArtand Design. Although Feng is very busy with his studies at the moment he says he will definitely make time to see the exhibition. ""I hope it will inspire me and help me with my own work,"" he said. Worth a total of US $600 million, the paintings ate by French Impressionist masters, including Monet, Cezanne, Renoir and Degas. As an art style, Impressionism was developed inFranceduring the late 19thand early 20thcenturies. Their work was a fresh and original way of painting. It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it. Often painting outside, rather than in a studio, the artists observed nature more directly and tried to capture individual moments in time especially the changing light of the sun. They avoided black and earth color1s and as a result their work is often very bright and can also look like that it is shining. When they first appeared, the artists were criticized for not finishing their paintings and for being lazy. Critics said the Impressionists were satisfied with just a few inexact brushstrokes instead of completing a real painting. It was an art critic who first used the term ""Impressionist"" in a review of Monet's work ""Impression, Sunrise""(1873) to satirize his loose, inexact manner of painting. ""Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love,"" said Monet. Monet is the leading figure in the creation of Impressionism. He painted sunlit rivers and gardens with forceful brushstrokes and bright color1s, in which objects lose their shape in the light. Monet's painting reached its height in his later life with his paintings of water lilies."	"[""Fifty-one Impressionists' paintings are now on display in Beijingas part of the Year of France.""]"

The competition encourages young people to carry out their bright ideas. There were two groups in the contest: Group One was for schoolchildren under 16; Group Two was for schoolchildren over 16. And there were eleven prize-winners, altogether. Neil Hunt, one of the prize-winners, was called""Sunshine Superman.""It's important when people study the weather to be able to record sunshine accurately. We need to know how many hours of sunshine we have and how strong it is. Most sunshine recorders only record direct sunlight. Neil's is more accurate and this is very important for research into the way of using solar power. You can do so much with animated cartoon. Look at Simon West's idea for animated road signs. He uses pictures which appear to move as you go nearer to or farther from them. This isn't a new idea. But it is new to use these pictures on road signs.""We found that people were more likely to see moving signs,""said Simon. So now, you can really see rocks falling, trains moving, horses running or a car falling over the edge of a cliff . Quite a warning! The ideas in the competition were so inventive that we are surprised that British industry doesn't ask more schoolchildren for suggestions. Perhaps this will be the start of""pupil power!"""

56. We are told that George expected Jim to help _ .	"George had stolen some money, but the police had caught him and he had been put in prison. Now his trial was about to begin, and he felt sure that he would be found guilty and sent to prison for a long time. Then he discovered that an old friend of his was one of the members of the jury at his trial. Of course, he did not tell anybody, but he managed to see his friend secretly one day. He said to him, ""Jim, I know that the jury will find me guilty of having stolen the money. I cannot hope to be found not guilty of taking it ---- that would be too much to expect. But I should be grateful to you for the rest of my life if you could persuade the other members of the jury to add a strong recommendation for mercy to their statement that they consider me guilty."" ""Well, George,""answered Jim. ""I shall certainly try to do what I can for you as an old friend, but of course I cannot promise anything. The other eleven people on the jury look terribly strong-minded to me."" George said that he would quite understand if Jim was not able to do anything for him, and thanked him warmly for agreeing to help. The trial went on, and at last the time came for the jury to decide whether George was guilty or not. It took them five hours, but in the end they found George guilty, with a strong recommendation for mercy. Of course, George was very pleased, but he did not have a chance to see Jim for some time after the trial. At last, however, Jim visited him in prison, and George thanked him warmly and asked him how he had managed to persuade the other members of the jury to recommend mercy. ""Well, George,"" Jim answered, ""as I thought, those eleven men were very difficult to persuade, but I managed it in the end by tiring them out. Do you know, those fools had all wanted to find you not guilty!"""	['lighten his punishment']
According to para.3, standing up while working _ .	"It took courage to stand up at work. Now more and more people like to have a change and stand up when they are on something important. Standing up is popular. Medical researchers have found that people who stand at work tend to be much healthier than those who sit. In the last few years, many office supply companies have begun to sell the adjustable- height desk. These so- called "" sit/ stand"" models are equipped with an electric motor that lets them shift from chair height to person height at the push of a button. Unfortunately, they're regarded as specially furniture. Sit/ stand desks tend to be expensive, hard to find and not easy to test it in person. When you worked standing up, your mind was more excited and new ideas kept coming out. This is because when you're standing, you feel a bit _ from your desk. If you got stuck on a word or sentence as you wrote, you found yourself shaking your arms, bouncing on your feet or stepping away from the desk for a bit------ things you couldn't do in a chair. Often, standing up seemed to relax your mind enough for you to get over creative barriers. There's one other thing about standing for a long time; you tended to get hungrier than you do when you sit on a chair. That felt like confirmation of the stand-up advocates' belief that you burn more calories when you stand than when you sit. For this reason alone, I'm hoping that sit/ stand desks one day hit the mainstream, with mass- market furniture companies making many low- priced versions. We could all do with a bit more standing up."	['can make us relaxed and be creative']
Which of the following statements is TRUE about Ms Pethrick?	"Norm Pethrick, a 36-year-old man in Australia's northern city Darwin, was praised on Thursday for jumping onto a crocodile's back to save his wife Wendy at Litchfield National Park, a popular tourist spot southwest of Darwin, a local newspaper reported. Ms Pethrick was standing on a river bank Wednesday afternoon when the saltwater crocodile lunged , locking its jaws on both her legs as it tried to drag her underwater. Norm Pethrick, who with his wife had been collecting water, immediately went to help her. He jumped onto the back, poked the eyes of the crocodile and finally got his wife free. Ms Pethrick was later taken to Royal Darwin Hospital for a medical treatment. The doctors said she was suffering eight puncture wounds in her right leg, a puncture wound in her left leg and a serious cut to one of her fingers. ""This could have been a fatal and tragic situation,"" said the general manager of Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH), Dr Len Notaras, according to a local report. He said Ms Pethrick was saved by her husband's ""quick and diligent actions"". Dr Notaras also said she would remain in hospital for three to four days and have an operation to clean the wounds, which are easy to get infected because of bacteria on the teeth of the crocodile."

We can learn from Paragraphs 2 and 3 that the father _ .	"""Dad,"" I say one day .....take a trip. Why don't you fly and meet me?"" My father had just reired........... His job filled his day, his thought, his life. While he woke up and took a warm shower, I screamed under a freezing waterfall Peru. While he tied a tie and put on the same Swiss watch, I rowed a boat across Lake of the Ozarks. My father sees me drfting aimlessly, nothing to show for my 33 years but a passport full of funny stamps. He wants me to settle down, but now I want him to find an adventure. He agrees to travel with me through the national parks. We meet four weeks later in Rapid City. "" What is our first stop?"" asks my father. ""What time is it?"" ""Still don't have a watch?"" Less than an hour away is Mount Rushmore. As he stares up at the four Presidents carved in granite , his mouth and eyes open slowly, like those of little boy. ""Unbelievable,"" he says, ""How was this done?"" A film in the information center shows sculptor Gutzon Borglum devoted 14 years to the sculpture and then left the final touches to his son. We stare up and I ask myself, Would I ever devote my life to anything? No directions, ...... I always used to hear those words in my father's voice. Now I hear them in my own. The next day we're at Yellowstone National Park, where we have a picnic. ""Did you ever travel with your dad? I ask. ""Only once,"" he says. "" I never spoke much with my father. We loved each other---but never said it. Whatever he could give me, he gave.""> In Glacier National Park, my father says, ""I've never seen water so blue.""

People can enjoy a wireless Internet service for laptop computers by _	Imagine that you are sitting in a park and suddenly remember that you need to send an urgent email. You have your laptop computer with you and you connect it to a wireless access point and access the Internet. Then you send your email. This wouldn't have been possible if there were no wireless Internet for laptops. Wireless Internet has come into our life in so many ways that we don't even realize what a necessary part it has become of our day-to-day lives. How do we connect to a wireless Internet service for laptop computers? There are two ways to do this. They are Wi-Fi connection and Bluetooth connection. Wireless networking is very easy. You just switch on the Wi-Fi button that has been provided in the laptop for Wi-Fi scanning. Once that is done, the computer will connect to the Internet. An interesting fact about Wi-Fi networking is that you can create a network between similar wireless equipment. Consider a situation where you and your friend both have Wi-Fi laptops, and there is some data you want to exchange. Traditional networking architecture demands that you have a wireless router . But the beauty of Wi-Fi networking technology is that you can set up a network between you and your friend's laptop, and share all the data you want. Broadband Internet connection is typically preferred by any user as it provides better speed for Internet surfing. Up until the invention of 3G mobile phones, Internet speed on mobile phones was very slow. 3G has the promise of changing the entire face of broadband technology. Just imagine browsing at speeds of more that 2MB per second. To give you a measure of the speed, 3G enables you to watch high quality live videos on the Internet. It is amazing to see how technology changes and the rate at which it changes. There may come a time when you may be able to browse using mobile wireless Internet for laptops anywhere in the world.

What's the best title for the passage?	"On a cold winter Sunday, the little man came up to me as I was about to enter the telephone box and asked me whether I had a match. ""I'm sorry,""I said.""I don't smoke, so I haven't any. You'd better ask someone else."" He looked rather disappointed, hesitated, and then turned away. I watched him walk slowly down the street before I picked up the telephone directory to look up the number I meant to dial. I'm not used to a public call box, so, at my first attempt to get through, the warning pips( ) had stopped before I realized I had to insert a coin. When I was at last able to speak, I was told that the person whom I urgently wanted to give a message to had just gone out. Swearing slightly under my breath, I got out of the box and came face to face with the little man. As he raised his hat again, I could see he was quite bald, and a thin line, resembling a dueling( ) scar, crossed one cheek. ""Excuse my troubling you again."" he said nervously.""May I walk along with you a little way? I must tell you the truth. I need help desperately. "" He had an unusually deep voice which suggested a strange combination of shyness and self-confidence. I was conscious of a fairly strong foreign accent and I wondered what country he had actually come from. I said that I had to catch a train in twenty minutes' time, but that he might accompany me to the station. ""I'm going to shock you,""he said suddenly, after a moment's silence.""Can you lend me five pounds? I have no money at all.""I have come across many strange characters during my life and plenty of people have tried to borrow money from me. I have generally managed to avoid lending them any. But, perhaps because of the very directness of his appeal, I somehow had the impression that his need might be desperately urgent. ""I'm sorry,"" I replied,""I'm afraid I can't lend you anything, as I'm not in the habit of carrying much money about with me. Don't you think the police might be the best people to ask for help?"" He hesitated,""I dare not go to the police,"" he said quietly. ""If I do go, they will have to send me home. That's what I'm afraid of. I don't know what to do. "" He shook his head rather sadly, raised his hat and left me. I caught my train and soon forgot the incident. It was three weeks later that I happened to glance at an old evening paper and caught sight of a small paragraph at the bottom of the front page: ""The unidentified body of a short bald man, with a deep scar across one cheek, was recovered from the River Thames yesterday. The police believed he had committed suicide."" I then noticed the date: just two and a half weeks before. It was I who might have been the final cause of his terrible tragedy. For days afterwards the cruelty of my refusal made me suffer continual shame and regret. I swore that I would never again refuse any appeal for help."	['Pity for a stranger.']
What did his parents want him to do?	"Have you ever heard the song called ""Is there anyone who told you""? It may be impossible for you not to know the song and its singer.It is sung by the famous ""Happy Boy"" Chen Chusheng, who appeared on Hunan Satellite TV.He caught everyone's attention. Before the competition he was just a farmer's son who had never got professional trainings of any kind. As a child, Chusheng wasn't a good student, but he was very interested in music. He liked to listen to and sing his favorite songs again and again. Like many other parents, his parents also wanted him to go to college,but he failed.Chusheng had no choice but to help his brother repair bicycles and motorbikes.In Sanya, a small city in Hainan Province, Chen worked during the daytime while singing in different bars in the evening. He lived like that until the year 2000. In 2000, Chen went to Shenzhen.He never expected that his first job in this new place would be _ food.He went on working in the daytime while singing in the evenings.His life was hard at that time.In the bar called Star-making Factories he met many famous local musicians.In the following several years, Chen, with his musical dream, attended many music contests throughout the country, winning prizes many times.

Speed reading is a necessary and important skill in the Internet age because people _ .	In the Internet age, speed reading is a necessary and important skill. We skim over articles and e-mails to try to get key words and the main idea of the text. With so much information through our electronic devices , it would be impossible to get through everything if we read word by word, line by line. However, a new trend calls on people to enjoy reading slowly. A recent story from The Wall Street Journal reported on a book club in Wellington, New Zealand, where members meet in a cafe and turn off their smartphones. They sit back in comfortable chairs and read in silence for an hour. Unlike typical book clubs, the point of the slow reading club isn't to exchange ideas about certain books, but to get away from electronic devices and read in a quiet, relaxed environment. According to the story, the Wellington book club is just one example of a movement started by book lovers who miss the traditional way of reading. Traditional readers, like Maura Kelly, say a regular reading habit sharpens the mind, improves concentration, reduces stress levels and deepens the ability to understand others. Some of these benefits have been backed up by science. For example, a study of 300 elderly people published by the journal Neurology last year showed that adults who take part in activities that use their brain, such as reading, suffer less memory loss as they get older. Another study published last year in Science showed that reading novels helps people understand others' mental states and beliefs -- a key skill in building relationships. Yet technology has made us less careful readers. Computer and phone screens have changed our reading patterns from the top-to-bottom, left-to-right reading order we traditionally used, to a wild skimming pattern as we hunt for important words and information. Reading text online that has many links to other web pages also leads to weaker comprehension than reading plain text. The Internet may have made us stupider, says British journalist Patrick Kingsley, only half joking. Because of the Internet, he says we have become very good at collecting a wide range of factual tidbits , but we are also gradually forgetting how to sit back, think and connect all these facts with each other.

And all of them have to get up at as early as six o'clock the next morning. Mr. Li, a doctor in a hospital, told me yesterday, ""Half of the students in Shenzhen are sub-healthy . The lack of sleep makes them tired and their health is becoming poorer and poorer."" Many parents worry about _ ."	['Too much homework keeps the students in poor health.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"The European Union announced plans on Tuesday to temporar-ily ban the use of animal cloning for food production, while allowing imports of food derived from the offspring of clones from the United States and elsewhere. The report from the European Commission followed a call by EU lawmakers in July for a total ban on food derived from cloned animals and their traditionally bred offspring, citing ethical concerns over the industrial production of cloned meat. The Commission said a temporary five-year EU ban on cloning for food production was justified on animal welfare grounds, but said banning imports of food from the offspring of clones was unnecessary and would disrupt global trade. ""Food from cloned animals is safe. In fact, the scientific opinion is that it cannot be differentiated in any way from food normally bred animals. The issue is animal welfare,"" EU Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli told reporters. Food derived from the offspring of clones presents no such animal welfare issues, and banning its sale and import would be impossible because the origin is untraceable, Dalli said. ""Such a prohibition would lead to a ban of imports of any food of animal origin (meat, milk and processed products)from third countries allowing the cloning technique,"" the report said. ""We're not going to regulate for the world,"" Dalli added. But animal welfare groups criticized the Commission's decision, saying it had bowed to pressure from third countries. ""We do not accept the Commission's position that it would be impossible to enforce a ban that includes the offspring of cloned animals, as (other) meat traceability systems are already in place,"" said Sonja Van Tichelen, director of the Eurogroup for Animals."

What will the circus most probably do?	"Tragedy at the Circus In yesterday's circus show, a tiger suddenly attacked its trainer and had to be shot dead. As the circus packed up and left, circus officials said the show would go on, even without tigers. However, the officials cann't simply turn a blind eye to the ethical problems left behind. Even before this tragedy , animal rights activists protested against keeping wild animals in unnatural conditions and forcing them to suffer for the profit of circus organizers. It is now time for us to take effective steps to make sure that circus animals are treated properly. ******************************* Circus Safe for Animals Our circus recently suffered a most tragic event in its history. While we are thankful for the pity from the public, we are also astonished by the opinion expressed in ""Tragedy at the Circus. "" First, our performing animals are not taken from the wild. As to the ethical problems. we always believe humans and animals can--and should--live together nicely. To us, the performing animals are representatives of their species , and our circus is one of the only places left willing to support this special role of performing animals in the existence of the species. Those who argue that circus life is harmful to animals show little knowledge of these facts. Life in the ""wild"" is unsafe, but a continuous struggle for existence. To overlook these realities is the greatest fault against the animal kingdom. This circus has proven that animals are stronger and smarter than we could imagine. Within the circus is a joyful atmosphere for both animals and humans: people are educated, and species saved."	['Continue its performances.']

Why did Bob feel excited?	Bob Harris was a weatherman at a small television station. He worked for twenty years and during those twenty years, he felt that his life was boring. Every day, he studied the weather and tried to predict the next day's weather. Then, he stood in front of the camera and read his report. Some days it was cloudy, some days it was sunny; sometimes rainy, while sometimes snowy. The weather changed each day, but Bob still felt that his job was always the same. His boss often told him to be happier and smile more in front of the camera, but Bob rarely smiled. He thought that most people did not watch his weather report and his job did not matter much to anyone. One day, he arrived at work and began to study the weather as usual. He noticed that something was different that day. Everything he studied told him that there was going to be a very big storm very soon, though he was not completely sure. Suddenly, Bob felt excited. He ran to his boss's office and asked to do a special weather report. The boss agreed and Bob gave a special report that afternoon, warning people of the coming storm. Because of this report, many people were safe during the storm. Bob realized that his job was actually very important.	['Because he wanted to do a special weather report.']
What is the author's attitude towards these super parents' behaviors?	At heart, parents always wish the best for their children, and they work hard for that. Nowadays, we see parents deciding the schools for their little ones before the baby is even born. Once kids start going to school, some parents want to have a time-to-time update of their kid's activities. They want to come to the classroom every day, keep an eye on whom they talk to, know the friends they keep, start telling them how to do their job, and keep talking or giving a feedback to them about everything under the sun. Besides, they send their kids for extra hobby classes, as they want their children to do best in every field. When it comes to the education, super mom and dad have all the plans made for their children, and I am sure that they have come up with the best. So, try to fight for the dreams that your parents have set for you. However, in some cases, it may happen that the kids have some different dreams. Parents sometimes don't even consider the choices of their kids and may force them to do what they wanted to do in life. It's good to plan the future for the children, but leave at least some decisions to them. So what should the children do? First, hear out all the plans that your parents have made for you. If you have some different ideas, then sit down and talk to your family about it. Be patient and respect their decisions, but put your plan forth, and make them understand what you want to do and why. Many times, you are not aware of the difficulties that you may have to face while _ your dreams. Ask your parents for suggestions, which will make them feel good and involved. That way, they may support you if you are going on the right path.	['Opposed.']
According to the author, it is _ to get rid of smoking.	Risk of death is 3.5 to 5 times greater for obese smokers than it is for people who have never smoked and are at a normal weight, according to a study published in the November, 2006 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. The study, which began with a self-administered questionnaire taken between 1983 and 1989, asked more than 80,000 radiologic technologists aged 22 to 92 questions about age, height, weight and smoking behavior. BMI (body mass index) was calculated, with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 being considered obese, and 35 and over being very obese. Smoking behavior was analyzed by looking at a person's tobacco consumption level, number of years smoked, and current smoking status. Researchers then followed participants through December of 2002, noting the number of deaths that occurred. The study involved researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the University of Minnesota and the American Registry of Radiolegic Technologists. Key Findings: 20 percent of obese adults in the United States smoke. Obese smokers face a greater risk of death from cancer and circulatory disease. Current smoking is a greater risk factor for death by cancer than obesity is, generally speaking. The higher a person's pack-years (number of packs smoked per day times the number of years smoked) are, the greater the risk of death.www.zxxk.com Men and women of all ages faced an elevated risk of death due to circulatory disease as BMI increased. And for those who were both obese and currently smoking, risk of circulatory disease increased 6 to 11 times under the age of 65, as compared to their never-smoking, normal weight counterparts. While it's not surprising that obesity coupled with smoking is a recipe for trouble, it is important to highlight this growing health concern in America today. Taking Charge of Your Health Making healthy choices can be difficult when we're constantly exposed to products that are dangerous to our health, but it's not impossible. With education and some motivation, we all have the ability to make lasting changes for the better. If you're an overweight smoker worried about gaining weight due to quitting, take heart. It's never too late to change your course and even reduce damage to some extent.	['difficult but worthwhile']
Daniel and Skip, who saved the lives of the two kids, _ .	"""Keep an eye on Esther. I'll be back in a second,"" Joy Warren said to her three-year-old son Stephen, who was sitting in the back of the Buick. She didn't like leaving the children alone in the car, but the baby was sleeping soundly. And it would only be a moment. She had hardly walked 40 yards when she saw the car moving. It headed straight towards the river. Unable to swim, Joy shouted, ""My babies are in that car!"" Daniel Whitehead, a 17-year-old student, was walking by the river when the Buick crashed into the water just yards ahead .Without thinking, Daniel jumped in. Though a competitive swimmer, he was shocked by the icy chill. Two minutes earlier, Skip Womack had pulled to a halt as the Buick ran in front of him. Now seeing it hit the water and hearing Joy's cries, Skip got out of his truck and jumped into the water. He had only one thought: If I don't get them out, they'll drown. Daniel reached the car and grabbed a door handle. But the water was only four inches beneath the window, and the door wouldn't open. With one powerful punch, Daniel and Skip broke a window. Daniel reached inside and lifted Stephen out. He placed him on his back and set out for shore. At the same time, Skip squeezed himself through the window .He managed to free Esther from beneath her seat belt. After he got out of the car with the baby, he held her over the water and swam toward the shore. All this took place just seconds before the Buick disappeared beneath the water. Later, driving home, Skip thought of his wife and children--how close he'd come to leaving them behind. He thought of the miracle he'd lived through, and how two children were still alive because he and Daniel happened to be in the right place at the right time."	['were strangers before the accident']
How does the author sound when telling of these foreign plants?	Today, many people use plants from other places to design their yards. Well, do they have any influence on animals living nearby? As we know, plants supply food for things like insects and plant-eating animals. In turn, birds and meat-eating animals feed on these insects and plant-eating animals. It is easy to see how important plants are. Although foreign plants may look beautiful, they can cause problems when there are too many of them. I live in Virginia, USA, and sometimes see a plant--commonly known as Kudzu--that seems to cover everything in the area, even climbing over whole trees and houses. Kudzu is an unbelievable plant since it grows very fast. It was first brought to the United States from south-east Asia around the 1870's as a crop that farmers could grow. However, Kudzu quickly came to be considered harmful throughout the southern United States. Since Kudzu grows fast in many different environments, it can completely cover areas of land quickly. The plant is also not eaten by any insects or birds in the United States so it can grow unchecked. Kudzu can cover trees, bushes, and even houses. It costs the United States 500 million dollars a year to just keep Kudzu from growing too fast. The plant is a perfect example of what scientists call an invasive species, which grows more quickly than other native plants. All foreign plants have the possibility to spread quickly. Not only are they costly, but planting them in gardens actually takes away food from insects. If everyone filled their garden with plants native to where they live, many lovely butterflies and other native creatures would be attracted to their backyards! So, take a look out of your window -- how does your garden grow?	['Worried.']

""I can dye all color1s,"" said the traveler, ""Hire me and I'll teach you my art."" ""We never allow a stranger to enter our craft "", said the dyer. The traveler made the same offer to the other master dyers, but none would hire him. So he began his own dye shop. Folks soon crowded around asking, ""What are all these beautiful color1s called?"" He answered, ""This is red and that is yellow,"" and so on. Everyone began bringing him cloth to dye. When the master dyers saw this, they quickly apologized for their past insults , begging him to hire them and teach them his art."	['refusing to learn new ways']
Mr. Vogts writes this letter to the editor to _ .	"Dear Editor, I am writing to ask what has happened to our youth. They are not as polite, hard-working or clever as my generation. I will give you two examples. Last Friday, I got on the underground at 9.15a.m. It was very busy so there were no free seats. There were some teenagers sitting on the seats nearest me. I didn't know why they were not at school. They were talking loudly and laughing. It was difficult to read my newspaper with all the noise. A heavily pregnant woman and her daughter got on at the next stop, with lots of shopping bags. I expected the teenagers to let them sit down. They saw the woman but did nothing. I had to ask them to give her a seat. They reluctantly did so but give me a rude look. I got off at the next stop and was glad that the teenagers didn't follow me. Last Saturday, I had dinner with my friend's family. I was expecting to meet his children, who I hadn't seen for ten years. During dinner, we started talking about world politics. It soon became clear that they didn't know much. They couldn't tell me the name of the King of Spain or the President of Italy. All they knew about was the Internet and which singers were the most beautiful. In my day, students knew the kings, queens and presidents of every country in Europe. I worry about the future of Germany. How could these young people become responsible workers and parents? They sit around Macdonald's after instead of going to the library like I did at their age.

Today Paracutin is asleep. What is Paracutin? It was the first volcano in the world which was seen from its birth right up to the present day. On February 20, 1943, a peasant and his wife set out to work in their corn fields from the Mexican village of Paracutin. They were surprised to find the earth warm under their feet. Suddenly they heard noises deep in the earth and a small hole appeared in their field. In the afternoon there was a sudden loud noise and stones were thrown high in the air. The peasants ran from the field and turned to watch. They saw the birth of a volcano. Large quantities of stone and lava broke out and a little hill began to form. By evening this hill was 100 feet high and hot ashes were falling on the village. At night the strong light of the hot lava lit up the countryside. The trees near the village were killed and the villagers had to leave their houses. When the village was destroyed, its name was given to the volcano. The news quickly reached Mexico City, far to the east. Many people came to watch the scene. The volcano grew and grew for ten years and hundreds of square miles of forest were destroyed. Then Paracutin went to sleep.	['Paracutin is the first volcano in the world.']
The first International Clown Festival was _ .	From March 12 to 17 of each year, hundreds of clowns get together in the Bonior Regis Town, UK. They all wear tall blue hats and big red noses with colorful faces. The first International Clown Festival was in 1987, UK. All the clowns from all over the world came together to celebrate the great festival in England. During the festival, people can see clowns from the world. They are together for the world of clown shows. They try their best to please all the people for the festival. In the shows, they have big feet, funny noses and look really funny. They sing and dance in a strange way to make people laugh. All people for the festival can have great fun. Of course, children like this interesting festival best. Now women can take part in the clown shows , and they are very popular. But in the old days, only men could be clowns. There are different kinds of clowns like white faces, red faces, street clowns and clowns for children. All these clowns are popular with people.	['both A and B']
The old man drove home _ .	"An old man was going home late one night with his horse and cart after a day's hard work. When he was not far from his house, the light on the cart went out. He tried but could not mend it. He was near his home, and so he went along the road without a light. When a policeman saw this, he stopped the old carter. ""Where is your light?"" asked the policeman. ""No man may take a cart along the road at night without a light. You know that. You have broken the law ."" ""I had a light, but it has just gone out,"" said the old man. ""I don't believe that story,"" said the policeman. He took out a book and got ready to write. What's your name and where do you live?"" he asked. ""Please don't take my name,"" said the old man. ""My home is just there. You can see it from here. I had a light nearly the whole way. I haven't come far without a light."" ""You came all the way without a light. What's your name?"" The carter quickly took the policeman's hand and put it down on top of the light. The light was still hot and burnt the policeman's hand. The policeman jumped and he was very angry. ""Now, what do you think?"" said the carter. ""Did I come all the way without a light?"""

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Cyberspace, data superhighway, multimedia, for those who have seen the future, and the linking of computers, televisions and telephones will change our lives for ever. Yet for all the talks of a forthcoming technological utopia, little attention has been given to the implications of these developments for the poor. As for all the new high technology, the West concerns itself with the ""how"", while the question of ""for whom"" is put aside once again. Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communication revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transnational corporations take full advantage of it. Terms of trade and exchange, interest rates and money movements are more important than the production of goods. The electronic economy made by information technology allows the haves to increase their control on global markets -- with a destructive impact on the havenots. For them the result is unstable. Developing countries which rely on the production of a small range of goods for export are made to feel like small parts in the international economic machine. As ""futures"" are traded on computer screens, developing countries simply have less and less control of their destinies. So what are the options of regaining control?One alternative for developing countries is to buy in the latest computers and telecommunications. Yet this leads to long-term dependency and perhaps permanent constraints ( ,) on developing countries' economies. Communication technology is generally exported from the US, Europe or Japan;the patents, skills and ability remain in the hands of a few industrialized countries. It is also expensive, therefore imported products and services must be bought on credit usually provided by the very countries whose companies stand to gain."

The engaging work loved by both teachers and students does NOT include the work which _ .	Students who are engaged in their work are energized by four goals--success, curiosity, originality, and satisfying relationships. How do we cultivate these drives in the classroom? Ten years ago, we began a research project by asking both teachers and students two simple questions: What kind of work do you find totally engaging? and What kind of work do you hate to do? Almost immediately, we noticed distinct patterns in their responses. Engaging work, respondents said, was work that stimulated their curiosity, permitted them to express their creativity, and fostered positive relationships with others. It was also work at which they were good. As for activities they hated, both teachers and students cited work that was repetitive, that required little or no thought, and that was forced on them by others. How, then, would we define engagement? Perhaps the best definition comes from the work of Phil Schlecty (1994), who says students who are engaged exhibit three characteristics: (1) they are attracted to their work, (2) they persist in their work despite challenges and obstacles, and (3) they take visible delight in accomplishing their work. Most teachers have seen these signs of engagement during a project, presentation, or lively class discussion. They have caught glimpses of the inspired inner world of a child, and hoped to sustain this wonder, enthusiasm, and perseverance every day. At the same time, they may have felt held back by traditions of reward and punishment. Our challenge is to go beyond these very real difficulties and provide a practical model for understanding what our students want and need.	['is easy for them to do with little or no thought.']

Mark and his family came to the author's house to _ .	"""Mom, you should put some of your things away. The house should be safe for the baby,"" said my son Mark as he walked upstairs with his wife and fifteen-month-old Hannah. They visited us for the Thanksgiving holiday. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper showed. ""That one finger rule may work with other kids, but never Hannah,"" he insisted. When my three granddaughters first moved into our house three years ago, my friend offered me her secret to behave grandchildren. ""Teach them the 'one finger rule'."" All of her five grandchildren learned it at a young age and it proved to also work well with mine. I picked up my granddaughter and said, ""Well, Mark, just watch."" I hugged her and walked all around the great room. ""Hannah, you may touch anything in this room you want, but, you can only use one finger."" I showed the technique by touching my forefinger to the sculpture. Hannah followed my example. ""Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?"" She stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the ""one finger rule"". During their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering ""one finger rule"". She learned quickly. Months later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake. I watched Mark continue to practice the one finger rule. I smiled happily each time he asked Hannah to touch with ""one finger""."	['visit the author for the Thanksgiving holiday']
From the passage, researchers agree that it is _ that may probably determine blackpeople's risk of lung cancer.	"Researchers have found more evidence that suggests a relationship between race and rates of lung cancer among smokers. A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese, Americans and Latinos. The study, however, found almost no racial or ethnic differences among the heaviest smokers. These were people who smoked more than thirty cigarettes each day. Other comparisons have shown that blacks are more likely than whites to get lung cancer from smoking. But the scientists say few studies have compared the risks among Native Hawaiians, Asians and Latinos. Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings. The eight-year study involved more than 180,000 people. They provided details about their tobacco use and their diet as well as other information. They included current and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer. Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference. African-Americans and Latinos in the study reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites were the heaviest smokers. But the scientists note that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer. Many researchers disagree not only about the effect of race on the risk of disease, but even about the meaning of race. Yet scientists know that some diseases affect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines. Last June, the United State Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients. The name is BiDil. The agency called it ""a step toward the promise of personalized medicine""."	['the depth of cigarette smoke into their lungs']
While sending an astronaut into the space,we should consider the following EXCEPT _ .	Surface Exploration. Robots make great explorers on planets,moons,and other landing areas. Aside from earth,just about every surface in the solar system is unsafe for humans to explore. The air on most other planets is insufficient for humans to breathe,making it necessary to wear a space suit and oxygen equipment. The temperatures on these surfaces are much too hot or much too cold for any humans to withstand .Plus there would be complications with radiation,weather,and a lack of gravity. Robots have much less limitation in these areas and can survive much longer under these conditions. Data Collection. Robots are designed for collecting scientific data. Robots are also able to perform many tasks at a time and can process information much quicker and more efficiently. Important scientific projects from detecting minerals,analyzing ground samples,and finding water are all performed much quicker and more accurately by robots. Cost Effective. The use of robots has made the cost of space exploration much less expensive than it would cost for humans to do the work. In order to successfully send humans into space we would need to build a vehicle that can not only carry humans,but also enough food and water to keep them alive for the duration of the trip. Moreover,robots have no problems working for hours on end. Robots never complain,they don't require food or water,and they never need a bathroom break. Space Travel. Over the past 30 years or so there have been many different types of robots used successfully in the exploration of space. Perhaps the most famous and successful robots are the Spirit and Opportunity who have both been exploring the surface of Mars. They have both been very successful with experiments on soil and rocks and have even found evidence of water in Mars' history.	['the alien']
The article is mainly about _ .	Like schools in China, American schools begin in September after a long summer vacation. There are two terms in a school year. The first term is from September to January and the second is from February to June. Usually American children begin to go to school when they are five years old. Most students are seventeen or eighteen years old when they finish high school. But unlike middle school students in China, high school students in America take only four or five subjects each term. They usually go to the same classes every day and have homework for every class. After class they do all kinds of interesting things. After high school, many students go to college. They may go to a small or a large one. They usually have to pay a lot for their higher education. So lots of students work after school to make money for their studies. ,:	['the differences between schools in China and in America.']
Dark matter is difficult to investigate because _ .	"If you look at the night sky, you'll often see stars moving very quickly. In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high. But many believe the reason is that much of the universe is made of something called ""dark matter"". Groups of stars called galaxies, such as the Milky Way, might even be made up of 90 percent dark matter. How much something weighs depends on where it is. The same object weighs only half as much on Mars as it does on Earth and almost three times as much on Jupiter. So scientists prefer to talk about the mass of something rather than how much it weighs, because mass does not change. They can work out the mass of galaxies by measuring the distance between them and the speed they move at. Recently, Jorge Penarrubia, a senior academic at Edinburgh University, UK, and his team discovered something interesting: The mass of the Milky Way is only half as much as the mass of another nearby galaxy, Andromeda. This seems strange, and dark matter may explain why. Finding out more about dark matter could help us understand how the universe began, but this is not easy. Lots of scientists with different types of expert knowledge are working on the problem. We can't see dark matter, it's very difficult to measure and we can't find out its mass. Unlike stars, dark matter doesn't produce or reflect light. But we can make a good guess that it is there because of the way things move and the way light bends. Experts now think dark matter may be very different from the matter that we find on Earth. There may also be five times as much dark matter in the universe as ordinary matter."

What is this article mainly talking about?	"Old-Fashioned Play-For Pay Kids! Come to have a ball! Or 60,000 of them!

As public playgrounds grow increasingly worn and dirty, the for-profit centers offer clean, safe guided activity as well as a variety of challenging exercises to develop kids' physical fitness, usually for a fee of around $ 5 an hour. ""Playgrounds are dirty, not guided,"" says Dick Guggenheimer, owner of the two-month-old Discovery Zone in Yonkers, N. Y., part of Kansas City-based chain, ""We are indoors; we are padded; parents can feel their child is safe"". In order to satisfy the need of two-earner families, the new franchise stays open in the evenings, long after traditional public playgrounds have grown dark and unusable. However, these new playgrounds are not meant to be day-care centers. Parents are expected to go stay and play with their kids rather than drop them off. But several also provide high-tech baby-sitting services. At some of the Discovery Zones, parents can register their children in special guided programs, then leave them and slip away for a couple of hours to enjoy a movie or dinner. If there is a problem, Mom and Dad are called. The most fun of all, though, is getting to do what parents used to do in the days before two-earner families and two-hour commutes , play with their kids. That, at least, is old-fashioned, even at per-hour rates."	['A new type of business franchise of kids.']
From what Rick says, we know _ .	"Construction workers in Southern California have made a wild discovery. They were digging at a building site in San Timoteo Canyon when they unearthed hundreds of ancient animal fossils. Researchers say the bones hold important clues about the history of the region. Nearly 1, 500 fossils were recovered from the dusty canyon. The remains are about 1.4 million years old. They include the bones of a new species of deer, several small rodents and more. A giant cat fossil was also found. Scientists believe the animal was an ancestor of the saber- toothed tiger. Signs of plant life were uncovered as well. ""This is a huge find,"" says Rick Greenwood, a scientist studying the site. ""I don't think most people had any idea that those types of animals were wandering around here more than a million years ago."" San Timoteo Canyon is located about 85 miles from Los Angeles. The area of the canyon where the fossils were found was once part of a green river valley. Today, the region is dry and plant life is rare. Most of the fossils are well preserved. Experts say a muddy lake bed may have trapped thirty animals that wandered over for a drink. The mud helped to protect the animal fossils. The remains are a million years older than those discovered at the famous La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. Scientists studying the bones will be able to learn more about how the animals adapted to changes in the environment. ""We have a confused view of what this time period was like, "" says another scientist. ""A discovery like this could really be an important contribution."" About 35 different animal species are represented in the fossil collection. Scientists began removing bones from the site last fall. The project was completed this summer. Starting next year, the fossils will be on display at the Western Science Center in the nearby city of Hemet, California."	['more research work will be carried on in the canyon.']

What is the advantage of Lock Laces?	There are a lot of products out there that make your life easier. Some, however, are a little sillier than others -- so much that they seem like joke products. Here are a few products that sound crazy, but actually rule. Sleep Phones It's hard to imagine something sillier than a music-playing headband you wear while you sleep, but they exist -- and are quite popular. Sleep Phones won't give you the highest quality sound in the world, but if you prefer to fall asleep to music, they're far more comfortable than normal headphones. While they're a bit expensive, they might be perfect for you. There's also a wireless version if you prefer. Onion Goggles If cutting onion _ no matter what you try, it's time for desperate measures. We tested a bunch of methods for avoiding onion tears, and found the best solutions came down to cutting the onion under a vent , or wearing these stylish and awesome goggles. Lock Laces There're some great ways to tie your shoes better, but if you long for the laceless shoes of your childhood days, Lock Laces are a pretty good choice. They're basically elastic laces that remove the need to tie your shoes. Sure, people will make fun of you, but you can make fun of them after they trip over their own untied laces. Or you can make your own slip-on shoes with elastic tubing. 2D-Glasses Hate 3D-movies, but have to go to one? The difference between 2D-glasses and 3D-glasses lies in their lenses .

Which of the following things can be most easily remembered according to Russell Poldrack?	Faces that activate the same regions of the brain again and again are more likely to be remtembered. Practice makes perfect when it comes to remembering things, but exactly how that works has long been a mystery. A study published in Science recently indicates that reactivating neural patterns over and over again my store items into the memory. People find it easier to recall things if material is presented repeatedly at well-spaced intervals rather than all at once. For example, you're more likely to remember a face that your've seen on some occasions over a few days than one that you've seen once in one long period. One reason that a face linked to many different contexts -such as school, work and home- is easier to recognize than one that is associated with just one setting, such as a party, could be that there are some ways to access the memory. This idea, called the encoding variability hypothesis ,was proposed by psychologists about 40 years ago. Each different context or setting activates a clear set of brain regions; the hypothesis suggests that it is these differing neural responses that improve the memory. But neuroimaging research led by Russell Poldrack, a scientist at the University of Texas. Austin, now suggests that the opposite is true--items are better remembered when they activate the same neural patterns with each exposure. Poldrack's team measured brain activity in 24 people using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The subjects saw 120 unfamiliar faces, and each one repeated four times at varying intervals during the scan. One hour later, they were shown the faces again, mixed with 120 new ones, and asked to rate the familiarity of each. The researchers then looked at the brain responses that had been recorded when the subjects wee first shown the faces, focusing on 20 brain regions associated with visual perception and memory. Face that were later recognized evoked similar activation patterns at each repetition in nine of the regions, particularly those associated with object and face perception; faces that were later forgotten did not produce such pattern to the same extent in people's mind	['Something that activates the same regions of the brain again and again.']
Why was the writer's mother happy that day?	"When I was seven years old my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors told us my mom might be saved with surgery. But it could also kill her. She chose to have it. The day before the surgery I was off school, and my mom planned the best day of my life, everything I loved at seven and everything that would put a smile on my face. The day began with her waking me up saying, ""Kate, I have a surprise for you. Come and see."" The surprise was a doll I had wanted for the longest time. Throughout the day, she told me everything that she thought I would need to know to grow up and be a good person; she told me to be the best I could be and that I would always make her proud. We had a picnic in the park, and it was so cold that we moved to the car. The day was filled with laughter. For the first time in a long time I could see she was really happy. I would never forget her smile, or the way her eyes shone as if we were the same age. It was the best day of my life, and I will never forget the conversations we shared. My mother managed to live through the surgery. Now when I look back, I realize that the best day of my life could be her last and this could be the last day I would remember with her, the last one we shared. I also understand how unselfish a mother is."	['Because she left her child a special memory.']
Who sits on the desk to read the news?	"There are 5 channels on British television and each channel has several news programs all day long. Some programs are only for 3 minutes but some are one hour long. The people who read the news are called news presenters and because they appear on television every day, they are very famous. This is a popular news presenter in England called Trevor McDonald, in the news studio. He presents a program called ""News at Ten""every Monday to Friday evenings. Another popular news presenter is Kirsty Young. She has a more modern style of reading the news, as you can see, she sits on the desk not on a chair! Television news presenters need to have worked as journalists because they have to write most of the news that they read. Sometimes an important new event happens after the program has started, so the presenter has to be able to read something without looking at it first. They must always keep calm even when there are many changes during the program. At the end of ""News at Ten""Trevor McDonald says ""And finally..."". Then he reads an unusual or interesting item. It's a famous saying in England now."	['Kirsty Young.']
What's the author's attitude to fast food advertisements?	Fast food advertisements greatly influence teens' eating habits and advertisers are increasingly targeting them with a wide range of promotions. Fast food advertisements significantly affect teens' eating habits, leading to consequences such as obesity. TV Advertising The television is the largest source of food ads to teens. It is worth noting that TV watching may not be the chief cause of obesity, but rather the fast food commercials. This implies that fast food commercials greatly influence teens' eating habits, since food is the most advertised item on television. Online Advertising The Internet has become part of a teen's daily life. Fast food manufacturers have taken advantage of this to target teenagers with food commercials. McDonald's corporation has created websites such as 365Black.com. which target minority groups. MeEncanta. com is a McDonald's website that targets Latino youth, who are four and a half times more likely than other youth to visit the site. Eating Habits There is a strong connection between teens' eating habits and fast food commercials. In a study of more than 12,000 teenagers to inquire into the effects of fast food advertising on teenagers, teens who spent more than two hours watching commercial TV were likely to allow themselves to eat more unhealthy foods like fast foods, sugary drinks and snacks than those who did not. Obesity Teens who view fast food ads are at a higher risk of becoming overweight than those who do not, reports the American Academy of Pediatrics. In a survey of 3,342 youths aged between 15 and 23 researchers found that a higher percentage of obese and overweight participants identified with fast food ads.	['Critical.']

Film cameras After all, a film camera is basically a light - proof box. It has a lens system to focus light onto the film at the back of the camera. Let's suppose that we are outside on a beautiful summer day trying to take a picture of the family dog. We are using a film camera. We finally get the dog to lie still. You point the camera at him. What happens? Light goes into the camera lens and hits the shutter. In other words, nothing happens yet. Now let's say that the dog looks really cute and you decide to snap a picture. What happens? When you press the button, the shutter opens for a very short period of time. A small amount of light passes through and hits the film at the back of the camera. This creates an upside-down and reversed image on the film. When you finish the roll of the film, you can take it to the photo shop to develop it and you will have a great picture of your dog! Cameras come with different lens lengths. Why does it matter? Many small cameras have shorter focal lengths, which means that there is a small distance between the lens and the place where the light focuses at the back of the camera. This gives you a large view of the area you are taking a picture of. Lenses with a long focal length show a smaller area but allow you to focus on distant objects and make them bigger. They are often called telephoto lenses. A good example of a long focus lens is one that is used by sports photographers to get photos of football players as if they were standing right beside them. Digital cameras In digital cameras, the light falls not on film but onto a sensor called a CCD (Charge Coupled Device). This digitally converts light and color into a digital information or pixels . The CCD is the heart of any digital camera and usually the most expensive part ---- depending on how good it is.	['the image of the dog is not created']
We can learn from this text that Peter _ .	"I sat at my seat waiting for the school paper to be passed around. I waited anxiously, knowing that once I received it I would know how good a writer I really am. When the paper arrived at my classroom, I nearly knocked down five of my classmates to get to the first paper. With a school paper in my hands, I returned to my seat. About a month earlier, I had handed in one of, what I believed to be, my best stories. I named it Symbol of Success. The head of the English Department at my school, Professor Cullen had said that she would include some reviews of students' stories in the latest school paper. Professor Cullen was known for her rough criticism. Impressing her was very hard but I wanted to be the first to do so. I sat at the edge of my seat as I read through the other story reviews. There wasn't one story that got more than three stars .I became calm and wasn't anxious to know my review. It was long after that I heard someone shout out ""Five stars?! Seriously !"" from behind me. I turned around and saw the shocked expression of Gene's face, ""Peter, your story got five stars!"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I turned my attention back to my story and saw the five stars at the end of the review that I had not read yet. I looked through the review written by Professor Cullen. She wrote that I had a gift for story writing. I was proud that I achieved what I thought was impossible .For so long I believed I wasn't as good as I thought I was and that my talent was not enough to cover up my lack of wring skills .But this review proved that I was truly a good writer and that there was a future ahead of me in the field of fiction writing. The review and the five stars meant the world of me. Those five stars became the symbol of my success."	"[""didn't know he got five stars until others told him""]"

What is the best title for this passage ?	"Let us begin by saying what does not cause our dreams. Our dreams do not come from ""another world "". They are not messages from outside source. They are not a look into the future , either . All our dreams have something to do with our feelings, fears, longings, wishes, needs and memories. If a person is hungry , or tired or cold , his dreams may include a feeling of this kind .If the covers on your body , such as a quilt or a blanket have slipped off your bed , you may dream that you are sleeping on the ice and snow. The material for the dream you will have tonight is likely to come from the experience you have today. So the subject of your dream usually comes from something that has effect on you while you are sleeping (feeling of cold, a noise, a discomfort, etc.) and it may also use your past experiences and the wishes and the interests you have now.This is why children are likely to dream of fairies, older children of school examinations, hungry people of food, home-sick soldiers of their families and prisoners of freedom. To show you how this is happening while you are asleep and how your needs and wishes can all be joined together in a dream , here is the story of the experiment.A man was asleep and the back of his hand was rubbed with a piece of absorbed cotton.He would dream he was in hospital and his charming girlfriend was visiting him , sitting on the bed and feeling gently his hands! There are some scientists who have made a special study of why we dream, what we dream and what those dreams mean.Their explanations of dreams , though a bit reasonable, is not accepted by everyone but it offers an interesting approach to the problem.They believe that dreams are mostly expressions of wishes that do not come true.In other words, dreams are a way of having your wishes carried out."

The author's attitude towards the tropical deforestation is _ .	"One reaction to all the concern about tropical deforestation is a blank stare that asks the question, ""Since I don't live there, what does it have to do with me?"" The answer is that your way of life, wherever you live in the world, is tied to the tropics in many ways. If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives? Now, you should have got the answer."	['opposed']

Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	"Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their ""tag"" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines."	['In the 1960s, in New York, young people wanted to say no to the rules through graffiti art.']

But you must go there yourself to feel its true size and beauty. The Grand Canyon is one of the greatest natural wonders of the world The Colorado River formed the Grand Canyon over millions of years.Slowly,the river cut down through hard rock.At the same time,the land was rising.Today,the canyon is 1.5 kilometres deep and 445 kilometres long.The oldest rocks at the bottom of the canyon are more than 1 billion years old.The width varies from about 200 metres to 29 kilometres across.The rim or top of the canyon is about 2,300 metes above sea level on the South Rim,and about 3,000 metres on the other side,the North Rim.As a result,there are different kinds of plants and animals on opposite sides of the canyon.The South Rim is a dry desert country.The North Rim has tall forests. The canyon looks different at different times of day, and in different seasons and weather. At sunrise and sunset the red, gold, brown and orange color1s of the rocks are especially clear and bright. In winter, the canyon is partly covered with snow. The view from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon is the best. Most visitors come here and stay in campgrounds or hotels. Every point along the canyon's edge offers a different view. The North rim of the Canyon is quieter. It takes all day to drive there from the South Rim because there is only one bridge across the Colorado River.

"If you've ever been told to ""lighten up"" or ""chill out"", it means _ ."	"Nobody likes an old poop . Developing a sense of humor is part of becoming a mature, emotionally healthy individual. Laughter is good for the soul, builds friendships and relieves stress. It serves as the glue for social situations and as an ice-breaker for sadness and boredom. If you've ever been told to ""lighten up"" or ""chill out"", you should save the blue attitude for serious situations and develop your sense of humor. Forgive the accidental. A sudden fall is humorous not because we like to see people fall, but because it surprises. From a spilled water glass in a meeting to Aunt Rae's teeth coming off in the Thanksgiving turkey, the embarrassment of accidents can be relieved by humor and a helping hand. After making sure that nobody's hurt, forgive accidents with a chuckle rather than a scolding. Look for the unexpected. The kid who used to look at you with his eyes closed during a test had the idea. Parents who serve green eggs and ham to their children on graduation day get the idea. Unexpected actions lighten an atmosphere and relax people. Learn to laugh with your kids. Most of what children say and do is funny. Help them learn that accidents are sometimes funny and sometimes occasions for joining in and helping another human being. By sharing laughs and attempting to explain humor, you develop your sense of humor, as well as help kids develop their own sense of humor."	['you lack humor']
According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?	When I was a kid, I was close to my dad, but as I grew older, my dad and I grew further apart. We always had totally different opinions. He thought that college was a waste of time, but for me it was important to finish college. He wanted me to work my way to the top as he had done in his field, but I wanted a different life. There was a time when we did not talk with each other. A few months ago, I heard that my 84-year-old dad was in poor health. When he called and asked whether I could move from Colorado back to Tennessee to help him, I knew he was seriously ill. I am his only child and so it was time to meet my father's requirement. Two weeks after moving back, we bought a boat and started fishing again. Fishing was one of the few things that we did while I was young and that we both enjoyed. It is strange but true that as we are fishing we are able to put things that have kept us apart for so many years behind us. We are able to talk about things that we have never talked about before. Fishing has been healing the old wounds that have kept us apart It is not important how many fish we catch. It is about enjoying the relationship that we have not had for years. I'm 62 and he is 84. When we are on the lake fishing, it is like two kids enjoying life. It is far better to find a way to put the unhappy past behind. I am so lucky to spend the happy time with my father in his last years. Now my heart is filled with love. A smile always graces my lips.	['Father used to think it was useless to attend college..']
What did the headmaster think of the author's way of teaching?	"I was in my third year of teaching creative writing at a high school in New York, when one of my students, 15-year-old Mikey, gave me a note from his mother. It explained his absence from class the day before. I had seen Mikey himself writing the note at his desk. Most parental-excuse notes I received were penned by my students. If I were to deal with them, I'd be busy 24 hours a day. The _ excuse notes made a large pile , with writing that ranged from imaginative to crazy. The writers of those notes didn't realize that honest excuse notes were usually dull: ""Peter was late because the alarm clock didn't go off."" Isn't it remarkable, I thought, how the students complained and said it was hard to put 200 words together on any subject? But when they produced excuse notes, they were brilliant. So one day I typed out a dozen excuse notes and gave them to my classes. I said, ""They're supposed to be written by parents, but actually they are not. True, Mikey?"" The students looked at me nervously. ""Now, this will be the first class to study the art of the excuse note--the first class, ever, to practice writing them. You're so lucky to have a teacher like me who has taken your best writing and turned it into a subject worth studying."" Everyone smiled as I went on, ""You used your imaginations. So try more now. Today I'd like you to write 'An Excuse Note from Adam to God' or 'An Excuse Note from Eve to God'. "" Heads went down. Pens raced across paper. For the first time ever I saw students so careful in their writing that they had to be asked to go to lunch by their friends. The next day everyone had excuse notes. Heated discussions followed. The headmaster entered the classroom and walked up and down, looking at papers, and then said, ""I'd like you to see me in my office."" When I stepped into his office, he came to shake my hand and said, ""I just want to tell you that that lesson, that task, whatever the hell you were doing, was great. Those kids were writing on the college level. Thank you."""	['Excellent.']
Which of the following would be the most proper title for the text?	"Why is pink or purple a color for girls and blue or brown for boys? The answer depends largely on cultural values as well as personal experiences. To the Egyptians, green was a color that represented the hope and joy of spring, while for Muslims, it means heaven. Red is a symbol of good luck in many cultures. In China, children are given money in a red envelope to bring good fortune in the New Year. For many nations, blue is a symbol of protection and religious beliefs. Greek people often wear a blue necklace hoping to protect themselves against evils . People's choice of colors is also influenced by their bodies' reactions toward them. Green is said to be the most restful color. It has the ability to reduce pain and relax people both mentally and physically. People who work in green environment have been found to have fewer stomach aches. Red can cause a person's blood pressure to rise and increase people's appetites . Many decorators will include different shades of red in the restaurant. Similarly, many commercial websites will have a red ""Buy Now"" button because red is a color that easily catches a person's eye. Blue is another calming color. Unlike red, blue can cause people to lose appetite. So if you want to eat less, some suggest that eating from blue plates can help. The next time you are deciding on what to wear or what color to decorate your room, think about the color carefully."	['The Meaning and Function of Color']
Why do American teenagers like to have a part-time job?	Having a part-time job is an important part of growing up for American teenagers. It can teach them important skills that will be useful for the rest of their lives. And many teenagers find that making their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom. American teenagers are allowed to do part-time jobs at the age of 14. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after school, and work for longer at weekends. In summer, top part-time jobs for teenagers include at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for those who want to be active and have fun while making money. Some of the most stressful jobs include teaching, nursing, and police work. These skills help to prepare teenagers for their later lives. When they grow up, the students with work experience are more likely to succeed than those without work experience. A favorite job for many teenagers is babysitting, and they can start before the age of 14 if their parents agree. As long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends. After the kids go to bed and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom. It can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job. However, many American teenagers _ their work experience and the skills they get from the job.	['Because they can learn skills and get money.']
Why did Jonathan run home immediately after school?	"On a hot summer's day Jonathan and his classmates were anxiously sitting in their classroom, waiting for the final bell of the day to sound. Jonathan prayed that the bell would ring soon, because he wanted to quickly run home before the three huge, fat, smelly bullies could see him. Every day the three bullies would wait there for an innocent school kid to tease and bully. The moment the bell sounded, Jonathan rushed out with his bag. He sped off across the school field and out onto the walkway. However, all of his effort was useless because leaning on a fence were the three bullies. Jonathan thought about crossing the street next to him, but it would be too risky. So he hid behind a small bush in hope that the three would leave. But he moved too quickly and was seen by one of the bullies. They approached him then. One bully grabbed Jonathan by the collar of his shirt and grabbed the money out of Jonathan's pocket and put it into his own. ""G-Give it back"", Jonathan weakly said. ""G-G-Give it b-back"", mocked the bully. The other two bullies laughed. Beside them was a small dirty stream. ""Let's throw him in there"", said one of the bullies. Then they threw Jonathan into the stream and walked off down the walkway. Jonathan shakily picked himself up out of the creek and continued his walk home with his head down and tears in his eyes. He dared not cry because he knew boys didn't cry. Jonathan arrived at his house where his mother was waiting outside the front door with an angry look on her face. ""Why are you so late and dirty?"" she asked curiously. ""I slipped"", he quietly replied."	['Because he had to escape being bullied']
What is the advice made by the Department of Health on drinking alcohol during pregnancy?	"Women should not drink any alcohol during pregnancy. A report released by NICE says. It says if they must drink, they should not do so in the first three months and should limit to one or two ounces once or twice a week afterwards. It replaces previous guidance of saying small daily amounts were fine. NICE decided to tighten its guidance partly because of the concern that people are now drinking more than in the past. Previous draft guidance suggested women should drink an ounce of alcohol a day once they were past the first three months of pregnancy. The Department of Health in England changed its guidance last year, calling for no drinking while pregnant or while trying to get pregnant. Drinking heavily in pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome , which can leave children with features like small heads, widely spaced eyes and behavior or learning problems. The experts said there was no evidence that several ounces once or twice a week would do any harm to the baby but could not categorically rule out any risk. National Childbirth Trust agreed women should limit their drinking during pregnancy. ""Pregnant women who have had a few drinks often worry a great deal about whether they have harmed their baby. In general, it is believed that if a light infrequent drinker, in good health, drinks to the point of drunkenness on one occasion, the risk to her baby is small."" NICE also made a number of other recommendations for the care of women in the UK who were pregnant or planning to get pregnant. It said vitamin D and folic acid supplements should be offered by health staff to help avoid conditions such as rickets and spina bifida . Officials also called for local health officials to ensure equal support plans where mothers encourage new parents to breastfeed are set up. NICE also called for improvements in the care of pregnant women with diabetes. About 20;000 pregnancies each year are affected by diabetes and, therefore, carry, higher risk of miscarriage and still birth. The guidance said women should get access to advice and support, in particular to achieve good blood sugar control before they get pregnant."	['No drinking for pregnant women.']

The purpose of Tom Bouchard's study is to find _ .	It is well-known that twins are closer to each other than most brothers and sisters ---- after all, they probably spend more time with each other. Parents of twins often notice that they develop special ways of communicating: they invent their own words and one can often finish the other's sentence. In exceptional circumstances, this closeness becomes more extreme: they invent a whole language of their own, as in the case of Grace and Virginia Kennedy from Georgia in the USA, who communicated so successfully in their own special language that they did not speak any English at all until after they started school. However, these special relationships are the result of lives spent almost entirely in each other's company. What happens when twins do not grow up together, when they are separated at birth for some reason? Are they just like any other strangers, or are there still special similarities between them? Professor Tom Bouchard, of the University of Minnesota, set out to find the answer to this question. He traced sixteen pairs of twins, who were adopted by different families when they were babies, and often brought up in very different circumstances. Each twin was then interviewed about every small detail of their life. The results of this research make a surprising reading. Many of the twins were found to have the same hobbies, many have suffered the same illnesses, and some have even had the same type of accident at the same point in their lives. One pair of middle-aged women arrived for their first meeting in similar dresses, another pair were wearing similar jewellery. The most incredible similarities are to be found in the case of Jim Springer and Jim Lewis from Ohio in the USA. The story of the 'Jim Twins' made headline news across USA. Born to an immigrant woman in 1939, and adopted by different families at birth, both babies were named Jim by their new parents. But what can be the explanation for these remarkable similarities? Is it all pure coincidence, or is the explanation in some way genetic? Research into the lives of twins is forcing some experts to admit that our personalities may be at least partly due to 'nature'. On the other hand, analysts are also anxious to emphasise that incredible coincidences do happen all the time, not just in the lives of twins.

The writer wants to tell us _ .	Is it a tree? Is it a bear? If you're looking at a tree in the shape of a bear, it's a topiary . A topiary is a tree or bush that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century. In the sixteenth century, people in Europe liked topiaries too. By the late 1600s, topiaries were also grown in America. Today it's popular in many parts of the world.	['growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills']

Try buying used textbooks -- it' s a surefire way to save money and serves the purpose as well. * Do never look at college life as an endless series of parties and social activities. But there is a whole lot more to college if you're serious about graduating. Having a good college experience is all about balancing work and fun. * Be mindful of your diet. Make healthy food choices and watch what you eat. Avoid foods that are processed or high in sugar. The ""freshman 15""is real. Many college students gain at least 15 pounds during their freshmen year. * While electives can be helpful when figuring out your major, you shouldn't entirely rely on them. Clubs and other organizations exist around. Get involved. Make sure, though, that you still have time to study. Having too much on your plate can hurt your grades."
