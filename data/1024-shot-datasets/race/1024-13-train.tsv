The writer's purpose in writing this passage is _ .	"Nine years ago, after Leo had died, people said to me. ""I never knew he was your stepfather."" You see, I never called him that. At first, he was no one special in my life. Then he became my friend. In time, I felt he was also my father. Leo married my mother when I was eleven. Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright possibilities. ""We'll plant trees there to give us shade as well as some flowers,"" he said. And just these little touches made our house different from all the others. More important, a real family was forming. Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it meant to have a father. Weekday mornings when the weather was bad, Leo often drove me to school. Having a father drop you off may have been something my classmates took for granted, but I always thought it was wonderful. Saturday mornings, we went to the hardware shop, then stepped into the five-and-ten, buying a sports magazine or something else. Some people might think that doing shopping together is nothing special, but I, who had ever before spent my childhood watching other families do their everyday activities, experienced them now with extreme delight. Looking back, I realized that Leo gave me what I needed most--the experience of doing ordinary things together as a family. Soon after we moved to the suburbs, one of our new neighbors introduced herself to me. She had already met my mother and Leo. ""You know,"" she said, ""you look just like your father."" I knew she was just making conversation--but even so... ""Thank you"", I said. Why tell her anything different?"	['to show his pride to have a good stepfather']

"""Our server was down"" is perhaps a lie told as an excuse for not _ ."	"Britain's most popular lie has been disclosed, with one in four people admitting using ""Sorry I had no signal"" when returning a missed mobile phone call, a survey found. Researchers found the average Briton tells on average four lies every day or almost 1500 every year. Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the ""ignore"" button when their mobile rang. Three quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men. The second most common fib is ""I haven't got any cash on me"" when asked for money by tramps , beggars and Big Issue sellers. ""Nothing's wrong - I'm fine"" came third followed by ""You look lovely"" and ""Nice to see you"". Modern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with ""I didn't get your text"" in 18th, ""Our server was down"" in 20th and ""My battery died"" in 26th place. Other lies to make the top ten included ""I'll give you a ring"", ""We're just good friends"" and ""We'll have to meet up soon"". ""I'm on my way"" and ""No, your bum doesn't look big in that"" completed the top ten. Men tell the most fibs, coming out with five every day compared to women who lie just three times. In many cases perhaps it is better to flatter with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults."

What is the main idea of the article?	Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid that crashed on Earth led to the disappearance of the largest animals that have ever walked our planet - the dinosaurs. At least, this is what some scientists believe. But that accident happened so long ago. People have come to believe that we are free of threats from asteroids and everything else from space. However, what happened on Feb 15 , 2013 was a reminder that we're just as _ as the dinosaurs once were. Two objects from space - a meteor and an asteroid called 2012 DA14 - visited Earth's atmosphere on the same day. The former fell in Russia, injuring 1,200 people, while the latter passed by Earth at a record-setting close distance. Scientists had been expecting the asteroid since last year, but the meteor was a surprise. NASA's telescope system only detects asteroids at least 50 meters in diameter , which is just about the size of 2012 DA14. But the meteor was much smaller, which made it harder to spot. But what if we do spot an asteroid that is headed right for Earth? There are several possible ways in which dangerous asteroids could be made to change its orbit. Which method is best depends on several factors and most importantly - how much time we have to stop it. If there is enough time before the hit, we can send off a heavy spacecraft to travel alongside the asteroid. The gravity from the spacecraft would gradually change the rock's orbit. Besides that, scientists could one day use sun-powered lasers to either make asteroids disappear or change their course. If there's not enough time, we'll have to go after the asteroid with a spacecraft and change its orbit with a crash. Finally, if things are truly desperate, there will be only one choice left - to use a nuclear bomb. That could turn the asteroid into a meteor shower, which would be even more dangerous.

What is mainly described in the text?	In Asia,there are special competitions where kites have complex designs and are fitted with instruments that make musical sounds as the wind blows through them.Although all kites have a similar structure ,they are widely different in size and shape.Kitefighting competitions are also held,in which competitors use their kites to attack and bring down their opponents' kites or cut their strings . For more than 15 years,the Big Wind Kite Factory has been giving kitemaking and kiteflying classes for the children on an island in Hawaii.In its kitemaking lessons,students can make kites in as little as 20 minutes!Children as young as four years old can learn how to fly a kite.Jonathan Socher and his wife Daphne started the kite factory in 1980.Their kites are made of nylon .Their designs are Hawaiian themes created by Daphne.The designs are cut out of the nylon with a hot knife that seals the edges and then fastened directly onto the kite. The kite that is used to give lessons is a regular diamond kite with a rainbow pattern.The difference between this kite and the ones they make during the lessons is that it is a twostring controllable kite.Big Wind employees fly the kite and for a few minutes show students how pulling on one line and then on the other controls the direction the kite goes in.Then the controls are given to the students. Jonathan insists that it is not necessary to make a huge impressive kite to have fun making and flying kites.Even the simplest structure can work,and can give hours of fun.Go on,give it a try!

"The best title for the passage is "" _ ""."	"In Yemen, you always see one type of vehicle on the road: the water truck.They travel mountain roads and cross deserts to bring Yemenis the goods more valuable than oil.It is one that only the rich can afford, with the supply regularly being cut off.Others must rely on scarce rain or charity to fight thirst. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.""In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, "" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. ""There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,"" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food."

Who do you think the passage is written mainly for?	A graded reader is a book containing simplified languages used to help learners master the language. Readers come in different levels, from beginners to advanced. English learners need to choose a reader that is suitable for their level. Why use readers? Lots of research shows that extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning, including vocabulary, speaking skills, fluency ,writing skills and reading comprehension. prefix = st1 /Reading is a way of learning English without classes or a teacher. It helps develop learner independence. And while reading graded readers, learners don't have to run to a dictionary because the language is at their level. How do I get started? The entire class can read the same book or different books at different times. How do I know the right level? If your class is all reading the same book, choose one that is appropriate for their level. If your students are reading different books, you can have a selection of books at different levels. In this case, don't worry too much about the level. A learner who is interested in detective stories might read a higher level book if the motivation is there. How to read the book depends on students' age, motivation and class time available. Some classes like to read silently, others like to read aloud in small groups and some enjoy being read to by the teacher. Be sensitive to the class and ask for their opinions. Some pre-reading activities are needed. Before students open a book, it is important to spark interest in the story and in the whole process of reading. For example, ask them to guess what the story is from cover, chapter titles and let students put them in the best order, or discuss the author. During reading, choose a suitable chapter or chapters that can be broken down to make a comic strip . Or students select a part of the book to make into a radio play. Students can also become journalists and report on parts of the story. Choose a piece of action and have students write it up. Besides, students can role-play an interview with a character.

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	We humans love to scare ourselves. Newspapers and TV news are full of shock-horror stories about the killer flu virus but are there things we can do to cut our risk of catching it? Every year, people in Britain catch the flu virus and some of those who are already ill, or are very young, may die. It is very sad, but modern treatment means that many deaths can be avoided. Experts tell us that the world is another flu epidemic and that the latest bird-flu virus would be the most likely cause. Humans can catch the disease only after closely contacting with a sick bird. However, if someone who had normal flu was to come into contact with bird flu, this could be very dangerous. The bird flu virus could attach itself to the human flu virus, _ and then start to spread from person to person. Coughs and sneezes always have spread diseases, especially colds and flu, and they still do. If bird flu does begin to infect humans, it will spread through coughs and sneezes. If you want to stay free of flu and someone coughs or sneezes at you, what should you do? First, keep your hands away from your face and wash them and your face as soon as you can. If a cough or a sneeze spray misses your face and you accidentally touch a droplet with your hands and then touch your face, the flu or cold bug could creep into your system.

The Internet has a history of more than _ years.	"Everyday we talk about and use the Internet, but how many of us know the history of the Internet? Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer network didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working on the time. At first the Internet was only used by the government, but in the early 1970s, universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still very expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software that made ""surfing"" in the Internet more convenient. Today it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among students.The Internet has now become one of the most important parts of people's life."	['fifty']
The author usually imagined a reporter as one who _ .	"My mind seems always to return to the day when I met Carl. The city bus stopped at a corner to pick up the daily commuters (someone who travels regularly to and from work), a group in which I was included. Boarding the bus, I looked for a place to sit. At last, I found a place near the back. The man in the seat next to the one I was going for was an older man in a grey suit, well-worn dress shoes, and a black hat like I always pictured reporters wearing, but without the little press card. Seated, I began to read the book I had been carrying, which was Jack Kerouac's On the Road. The man in the seat next to me introduced himself by asking if I had read any other book like the one I was holding. When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and so did I. He introduced himself as Carl and asked if I liked jazz, and I told him that I didn't really listen to it, and that I liked rock and roll. Waiting for Carl to tell me that I should listen to real music, I was shocked when he just smiled and nodded. He said, ""You remind me of myself when I was your age. I remember how my parents hated jazz and how they couldn't see how I could listen to that awful noise. I bet your parents say the same thing, don't they?"" Now it was my turn to smile, amused with how right he was. As the bus carried us from one side of the city to the other, Carl and I talked about a lot of different things. The more we talked, the more amazed I became at how much the two of us really had in common, despite the age difference. I haven't seen him since we parted, but the thought of our connection that day rarely leaves my mind. Carl really made me think about how much we can learn from each other if we just break through the blocks between us we've got. I mean, I would have never thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much older than I. But Carl taught me that no matter what we are, we are all just people, and that we should make an extra effort to try and get to know our neighbors and people we see every day, regardless of age, race, religion, sex, or anything else. If we all take the time to attempt to understand each other, I think that the world would be a much better place that we could share together, as humans."	['usually wore a black hat and press card']

Italian families celebrate the Christmas Eve meal with different kinds of _ .	"The Christmas Eve meal is very important in most European countries.

Although the Feast of the Seven Fishes has been regarded as an Italian custom, no one _ knows the meaning of it. There are lots of explanations for it. Some people believe that seven fishes are served because it took God seven days to create the world. Other explanations mention the Seven Hills of Rome.

I was so seriously injured that I was in a _ for more than two months at Prince Georges Hospital.

Politkovskaya's father died of _ .	"Saturday, October 7th, was a marathon of sad tasks for Anna Politkovskaya. Two weeks earlier, her father, a retired official in the department of foreign affairs, had died of a heart attack as he _ from the Moscow Metro while on his way to visit Politkovskaya's mother, Raisa Mazepa, in the hospital. She had just been diagnosed with cancer and was too weak even to attend her husband's funeral.

A week later, she had an operation and since then Anna and Elena had been taking turns helping her deal with her grief. Politkovskaya was supposed to spend the day at the hospital, but her twenty-six-year-old daughter, who was pregnant, had just moved into Politkovskaya's apartment, on Lesnaya Street, while her own place was being prepared for the baby. ""Anna had so much on her mind,"" Elena Kudimova told me when we met in London, before Christmas. ""And she was trying to finish her article."" Politkovskaya was a special reporter for the small newspaperNovaya Gazeta, and, like most of her work, the piece focused on the terror that can be seen all over the southern republic of Chechnya. This time, she had been trying to report repeated cruel acts done by people faithful to the Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, who are in favour of Russia. In the past seven years, Politkovskaya had written dozens of accounts of life during wartime; many had been collected in her book ""A Small Corner of Hell: reports from Chechnya."" Politkovskaya was far more likely to spend time in a hospital than on a battlefield, and her writing bore frequent witness to robbery, and the uncontrolled cruelty of life in a place that few other Russians--and almost no other reporters--cared to think about."

We know from the text that Watson _ .	"Donald Watson was a man who thought very much about the food he ate. He was born in yorkshire, England , in September 1910. And he died in November 2005, at the age of 95. That is a very great age. Watson explained that it was because he never ate any food from animals. When he was a boy , Watson stayed on a farm. .He loved to see the animals. He said that they gave so much to people. And all the animals were so friendly. Then , one day , he saw a man killing a pig . He was very sad. . From then on, Watson decided that he would never again eat meat . Twenty years later he decided that he wouldn't eat anything from animals, such as milk, cheese or eggs. He became vegan . Watson formed a group called ""The Vegan Society"". In its newspaper, The Vegan Society thought it was terrible and wrong to eat food from animals. At first, there were not many people who agreed with him . They thought it was crazy to do _ .Most people thought it was too difficult and unhealthy. However, over time , more and more people began to agree with Watson and The Vegan Society. People become vegans for many reasons. Watson and his friend stopped eating because they loved animals. They believed that it was wrong to hurt another living thing . Now, people also become vegans for environmental reasons. Keeping animals takes a lot of resources , including water and food. Also, in some places, people are cutting down trees to create more land for cows. By avoiding food from animals, vegans hope to protect these forest areas. Finally, just like Watson, some people believe that being a vegan is healthier. They believe that food from animals causes heart problems, a high body weight and many other health problems."

Rooms for the night in private homes with breakfast have been popular with travelers in Europe for many years. In the past five to ten years, these bedandbreakfast places have become popular in the United States. Many of these America's bedandbreakfast inns are old historic buildings. Some bedandbreakfast inns have only a few rooms. Others are much larger. Some inns do not provide telephones or televisions in the rooms, others do. Staying at a bedandbreakfast inn is much different from staying at a hotel. Usually the cost is much less. Staying at an inn is almost like visiting someone's home. The owners are glad to tell about the areas and the interesting places to visit. Many vacationists say they enjoy the chance to meet local families.	['All of the above.']
Where does the text probably come from?	"When scientists accidentally killed what turned out to be the world's oldest living creature, it was bad enough. Now, their mistake has been worsened after further research found it was even older - at 507 years. The ocean quahog, a type of deep-sea clam, was dredged alive from the bottom of the North Atlantic near Iceland in 2006 by researchers. They then put it in a fridge-freezer, as is normal practice, unaware of its age. It was only when it was taken to a laboratory that scientists from Bangor University studied it and concluded it was 400 years old. The discovery made it into the Guinness Book of World Records. However, by this time, it was too late for Ming the Mollusc , named after the Chinese dynasty when its life began. Unfortunately researchers who calculated Ming's age killed it instantly by opening its shell. The researchers opened the ancient clam up to judge its age by counting growth rings inside. But the rings were so close together that scientists ended up having to count the rings on the outside to be accurate, leading CBS journalists to point out that if scientists had just started there, Ming could have lived on. Now, after examining the quahog more closely, using more advanced methods, the researchers have found the animal was actually 100 years older than they first thought. Dr Paul Butler, from the University's School of Ocean Sciences, said: ""We got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then. But we are absolutely certain that we've got the right age now."" The mollusc was born in 1499 - just seven years after Columbus discovered America and before Henry VIII had even married his first wife, Catherine of Aragon in 1509. A quahog's shell grows by a layer every year, in the summer when the water is warmer and food is plentiful. It means that when its shell is cut in half, scientists can count the lines in a similar way that trees can be dated by rings in their trunks. Jan Heinemeier, associate professor at the University of Denmark, who helped date Ming, told Science Nordic: ""The fact that we got our hands on a 507-year-old animal is incredibly fascinating, but the really exciting thing is of course everything we can learn from studying the mollusk."""

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	Xiang Xiaowen is a student who survived the earthquake in China's Sichuan Province. Like thousands of others, she is now living in a tent in the hard-hitting city of Mianyang. We are now sleeping in a tent city. The earthquake happened last Monday and our rooms in school were destroyed. There are four tent cities. Everybody is sleeping under tents. The tents are so wet and we feel so cold. Many students feel uncomfortable but we must live in the tent. Although there are many difficulties after the earthquake, we will do our best to solve them. Yesterday it rained all day. Today the weather is better. There are no dining halls and supermarkets, so we must cook for ourselves. We have got some food and vegetables to eat. After the earthquake, many students and I together cleaned all the rubble from our classroom and our dorms. Many of the rooms were destroyed and there was a lot of rubble which we had to clear. Some students are helping at hospital. Many people are homeless and many are dead. We carried the injured to hospital. There were no buses so we walked to hospital. Many people tried their best to make sure people could live. With the injured, we first let them calm down and then we took them to hospital. Today, I think people have enough food and drinking water. I think things will be better now.	['people in the earthquake-hit areas are suffering a lot']
Former President Cater is being spied because _	"Former President Jimmy Carter believes U.S central intelligence agency is spying on him -- so much so, he gives up email to avoid government spies. ""You know, I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored,"" Carter told NBC's Andrea Mitchell in an interview broadcast Sunday. ""And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write a letter myself, put it in the post office and mail it. ""I believe if I send an email, it will be monitored,"" Carter continued. The 89-year-old said the National Security Agency and others have abused the argument that gathering intelligence is important to homeland security. ""That has been extremely liberalized and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies,"" Carter said. The 39th president, however, stopped short of criticizing No. 44 over the handling of the N.S.A. scandal , the crisis in Ukraine or anything else. ""I don't have any criticism of him,"" Carter said of Obama. He was asked if the president ever asks him for advice. ""Unfortunately, the answer is no,"" Carter said. ""President Obama doesn't. But previous presidents have called on me and the Carter Center to take action."" Why not Obama? ""That's a hard question for me to answer, you know, with complete directness,"" he said. ""I think the problem was that in dealing with the issue of peace between Israel and Egypt, the Carter Center took a very strong and public position of equal treatment between the Palestinians and the Israelis. And I think this was a sensitive area in which the president didn't want to be involved."""	"[""he holds political views about regional conflicts that differ from Obama's""]"
All of the following are possible factors causing asthma except _ .	Five Things You Should Know About Adult Asthma About 44 million people in Asia Pacific suffer from asthma. The numbers are on the rise especially in China and India where there is rapid industrialization and urbanization. Dr Mariko Koh, Director of the Pulmonary Function Laboratory and Asthma Programme at Singapore General Hospital, tells us more about adult asthma: 1. Chronic inflammation of the airways When the airways are inflamed, mucus forms, blocking airflow, causing breathlessness, wheezing and tightness in the chest. 2. Common triggers Exposure to allergens such as mites, cockroaches, pets and pollen can trigger asthma. Tobacco smoke, respiratory infections, exercise and some medications like aspirin and beta blockers are also possible triggers. 3. Effective treatment Asthma can be controlled with medication. The main treatment of asthma is inhaled corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and block of the airways. Reliever medications may be used to treat acute symptoms. Take note: it is not too late to take medication after an asthma attack. 4. Take medication daily To ensure good control over asthma, medication must be taken daily on a long term basis to prevent attacks. Also, go to your doctor for regular checkups. 5. Quality of life Asthma sufferers can lead normal active lives as long as the symptoms are well controlled. Taking medication as directed and avoiding triggers can make a big difference to the quality of life.	['polluted air']
Why did the author suddenly smile?

""If you come by right now,""the receptionist said,""the dentist will fit you in ."" I look my purse and keys and rushed to my car. But suddenly I began to doubt about the dentist.What kind of dentist would be so eager to treat someone at such short notice?Why wasn't he as busy as the others? In the dentist's office,I sat down and looked around.I saw nothing but the bare walls and I became even more worried.The assistant noticed my nervousness and placed her warm hand over my ice-cold one.

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Next Stop: Planet Mars Fly me to the moon? That's not far enough. On September 14, 2011, NASA released designs for a superrocket, the Space Launch System (SLS). This time the final destination will be Mars. The SLS is a huge, liquid-fuelled rocket. If it is fully developed, it will be the most powerful rocket ever built. Its lift capability will be much bigger than that of the space shuttle of Saturn 5, the rocket that sent the Apollo missions to the moon. NASA is planning to launch its first unmanned test flight in 2017. It is hoped that the first crew will fly in 2021 and astronauts will make it to a nearby asteroid in 2025. NASA hopes to send the rocket and astronauts to Mars from the asteroid by the 2030s, according to the Associated Press (AP). NASA used liquid rockets to send Apollo, Gemini and Mercury into space, but later changed to solid rockets boosters because they were cheaper. Tragically, however, a booster flaw caused the space shuttle Challenger to crash in 1986. The new project plans to return to liquid fuel. According to AP, the rockets will at first be able to carry 77 to 110 tons of payload . Eventually they will be able to carry 143 tons into space, maybe even as many as 165 tons, NASA officials said. By comparison, the Saturn 5 booster could lift 130 tons and the space shuttle just 27 tons. However, unlike reusable shuttles, these powerful rockets are mostly one use only. New ones have to be built for every launch. This will be very costly. NASA estimates that it will cost about $3 billion (19 billion yuan) per year, or $18 billion until the first test flight in 2017. NASA hopes to make money by allowing private companies to send astronauts to the International Space Station like giant taxi services, so that the program can be ""sustainable"". ""This is perhaps the biggest thing for space exploration in decades,"" said Senator Bill Nelson, a former astronaut. ""The goal is to fly humans safely beyond low-Earth orbit and deep into outer space where we cannot only survive, but one day also live."""

It can probably be concluded that Finchley _ .	I sometimes wonder if old Finchley has the right personality to be a research scientist. He keeps asking when he'll be coming back. After all, it was his own fault. Nobody tries out what has just been invented on themselves any more but Finchley. Well, he must have pumped about a thousand cc into himself before I noticed he was clearly becoming smaller. It was funny watching him, because his clothes remained the same in size. They simply piled up around him so that he looked like a small boy in his father's clothes. But he kept getting smaller and smaller. As my colleague Dawson and I watched him, he disappeared! All we could see was Finchley's clothes on the floor. They looked so strange, because the lab coat was on top, shirt and trousers inside and, I suppose, underclothes inside again. It gave me a strange feeling, and I think Dawson was a bit shaken, too. Dawson was sitting on his chair in front of a microscope he'd been using to examine a family of mites . He looked through the scope kind of absently again, and was nearly scared to lose awareness when he found old Finchley waving back from the other end. It seems as if Finchley had taken a free ride on a dust mite and landed on the land of the mite family. Of course, we didn't know till Finchley told us later. But anyhow, as I said, Dawson nearly passed out. He jumped off his chair and pointed at the microscope, too shocked to speak.	['is a devoted scientist']
From the passage we can learn that David Salinger _ .	"Jerome David Salinger was born in Manhattan on New Year s Day,1919.His father was a Jew.His mother was of Irish descent. Never much of a student attended the progressive McBurney School.But he left school after two years and in 1934was packed off to Valley Forge Military Academy.In 1937,after a couple of unenthusiastic weeks at New York University,he traveled with his father to Austraia and Poland,where father s plan for him was to learn the ham business.Deciding that wasn t for him.he returned to America and driturned to America and drifted through a term or so at Ursinus College.His most sustained exposure to higher education was an evening class he took at Columbia in 1939,and under Mr.Burnett s directions he managed to sell a stpry""The Young Folks""to Story magazine.He afterwards sold stories to Esquire,Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post.In 1941,after several rejections,Mr.Salinger finally cracked The New Yorker,with s story""Slight Rebellion Off Madison,""that was an earlu sketch of what became a scene in""The Catcher in the Rye<<>> . ""But the magazine then had second thoughts,apparently worried about seeming to encourage young people to run away from school and held the story for five years--a long time even for The New Yorker--before finally pubishing it in 1946,buried in the back of an issus.

Which of the following is TRUE?	"You are enrolled in a full - time school called ""life"". Each day in this school you will have the opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or hate them, but you have designed them as part of your curriculum. Why are you here? What is your purpose? Humans have sought to discover the meaning of life for a very long time. What we and our ancestors have overlooked, however, is that there is no one answer. The meaning of life is different for every individual. Each person has his or her own purpose and distinct path, unique and separate from anyone else's. As you travel your life path, you will be presented with numerous lessons that you will need to learn in order to fulfill that purpose. The lessons you are presented with are specific to you; learning these lessons is the key to discovering and fulfilling the meaning and connection of your own life. As you travel through your lifetime, you may encounter challenging lessons that others don't have to face, while others spend years struggling with challenges that you don't need to deal with. You may never know why you are blessed with a wonderful marriage, while your friends suffer through bitter arguments and painful divorces, just as you cannot be sure why you struggle financially while your peers enjoy abundance. The only thing you can count on for certain is that you will be presented with all the lessons that you specifically need to learn; whether you choose to learn them or not is entirely up to you. The challenge here, therefore, is to align (......) yourself with your own unique path by learning individual lessons. This is one of the most difficult challenges you will be face with in your lifetime, as sometimes your path will be completely different from others'. But, remember, don't compare your path to the people around you and focus on the difference between their lessons and yours. You need to remember that you will only be faced with lessons that you are capable of learning and are specific to your own growth. Our sense of fairness is the expectation of equality - the assumption that all things are equal and justice will always prevail. Life is not, in fact, fair, and you may indeed have a more difficult life path than others around you, deserved or not. Everyone's circumstances are unique, and everyone needs to handle his or her own circumstances differently. If you want to move toward calm, you will be required to move out of the complaining phase of ""it's not fair"". Focusing on the unfairness of circumstances keeps you comparing yourself with others rather than appreciating your own special uniqueness. You miss out on learning your individual lessons by distracting yourself with feelings of bitterness and anger."	['You should learn to appreciate your specific uniqueness.']

What is the author's purpose of writing this passage?	The American Relay for Life is a life-changing event that gives everyone in communities across the globe a chance to celebrate the lives of people who have battled cancer, remember loved ones lost, and fight back against the disease. At Relay, teams of people camp out at a local high school, park, or an open place and take turns in walking or running around a track or path. Each team is asked to have a representative on the track at all times during the event. Because cancer never sleeps, it's an overnight event of up to 24 hours in length. History of Relay for Life: Relay began in 1985 when Dr. Klatt, a surgeon in Tacoma, Washington, ran and walked around a track for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer Society. Since then, Relay has grown from a single man's passion for fighting cancer into the world's largest movement to end the disease. Each year, more than 3.5 million people in 5,000 communities in the United States, along with additional communities in 19 other countries, gather to take part in this global event and raise much-needed funds and awareness to save lives from cancer. Requirements for Relay for Life: Anyone can participate in Relay for Life. Friends, families, neighbors, classmates, sports teams, etc., can form their own teams. No matter who you are, there's a place for you at Relay. The only requirement to participate in Relay for Life is the $10 registration/commitment fee per person. After that, anything you can raise through individual, team, or online fundraising is accepted. It is recommended that each participant sets a personal goal to raise $100. If you raise more, that's even better. Even if you do not raise $100, you are still welcome to participate. If you want to be part of Relay, you can start a team or join an existing team online. You can also make an online donation. By supporting Relay, you help the American Cancer Society save lives, and that helps us move closer to our ultimate goal of a world with less cancer and more birthdays. Online Help: Please check our Online Help&FAQ page for answers to commonly asked questions about online fundraising and about Bark For Life. Local Help: If you have questions that are not answered by the Online Help&FAQ page, or if you would like assistance from your local event representative, feel free to contact Jill Tetherow at (402) 310-2498, or jill.tetherow@cancer.org.

We can conclude from the passage that _ .	Living near the beach may come with an extra perk : better health. A new study analyzed information from more than 48 million people in England and found that the nearer they lived to the coast, the more likely people were to report good health within the past year. Living near the coast may be associated with better health because the seaside environment reduces stress, the researchers said. They pointed to another British study that found that people who took trips to the coast experienced more feelings of calmness and relaxation than those who visited urban parks or the countryside. The difference from living near the coast was relatively small. But a small effect, when applied to an entire population, can have a substantial impact on public health, said study researcher Ben Wheeler of Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry in Exeter, England. However, it's too soon to advise people to hit the beach to improve health, Wheeler said. The study only found an association, not a cause-effect link, and it's possible that other factors could explain the results. For instance, it could be that people who are wealthier, and therefore healthier, are more able to move to desired locations such as the coast, Wheeler said, a phenomenon known as the migrant effect. But the study did find that the association between coastal living and better health was strongest for those living in the poorest areas, which perhaps indicates that wealth cannot explain the results, Wheeler said. Because the study looked at only England--an island country in which everyone lives within 72 miles of the coast--it's not clear whether the findings would apply to other populations. Far from England, a health expert not involved in the study said that while the British research certainly doesn't prove that people's health and the place they live are linked, it's possible that _ to the seas does something for our bodies. If future studies confirm the results, the next step would be to find out it is what coastal environments that can benefit health. Wheeler said it may then be possible to bring those benefits to people living in other areas, through virtual environments, for instance.	['people living near the sea may be healthier.']
Why did Bunter have the feelings of unwillingness, shame and disgust?	"For three days Mr Bunter did not say a word.

Scientists think a fidget habit to be _ .	Have you eaten too much over the holidays? You should try fidgeting for a while. Those around you might not like it, but scratching (moving your nails against a part of your body) and twitching (moving suddenly and quickly when you don't want to) is an important way of burning up calories . American researchers have found that some people's squirming (continuously turn your body when nervous) and wigging (move in small movements, especially from side to side) equals several miles of slow running each day. The scientists, based at the National Institute of Health's laboratory in Phenix, Arizona, are studying why some people get fat and other stay slim. In one study 177 people each spent 24 hours in a room in the institute where the amount of energy is measured by their oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. By the end of the day, some people had burned up 800 calories in toe-tapping, (moving the front part of your foot up and down) finger-drumming (hitting your fingers continuously and lightly against something hard) and other nervous habits. However, others had burned up only 100 calories. The researchers found that slim women fidget more than fat women, but there was no significant difference in men. Heavy people burn up more energy when they fidget than thin people do.	['a way to lose fat']
According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	"Environmentalists said our planet was doomed to die. Now one man says they are wrong. ""Everyone knows the planet is in bad shape,"" thundered a magazine article last year. Species are being driven to die out at record rates, and the rivers are so poisonous that fish are floating on the surface, dead. But there's a growing belief that what everyone takes for granted is wrong: things are actually getting better. A new book is about to overturn our most basic assumptions about the world's environment. Rivers, seas, rain and the atmosphere are all getting cleaner. The total amount of forests in the world is not declining. The Skeptical Environmentalist by Bjorn Lomborg, professor of statistics at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, is an attack on the misleading claims of environmental groups, and the ""bad news"" culture that makes people believe everything is getting worse. Now the attacks are increasingly coming from left-wing environmentalists such as Lomborg, a former member of Greenpeace. The accusation is that, although the environment is improving, green groups -- with profits of hundreds of millions of pounds a year -- are using scare tactics to gain donations. Lomborg's book doesn't deny global warming -- probably the biggest environmental threat -- but destroys almost every other environmental claim with many official statistics. The Worldwatch Institute claims that ""deforestation has been accelerating over the last 30 years"". But Lomborg says that is simply rubbish. Since the dawn of agriculture the world has lost about 20 per cent of its forest cover, but in recent decades the forest area's depleting has come to a stop. According to UN figures, the area of forests has remained almost steady, at about 30 percent of total land area, since the 1940s. Forests in countries such as the US, the UK and Canada have actually been expanding over the past 40 years. Despite all the warnings the Amazon rainforest has only shrunk by about 15 percent. Nor are all our species dying out. Some campaigners claim that 50 percent of all species will have died out within 50 years. But other studies show only 0.08 percent of species are dying out each year. Conservation efforts have been successful. Whales are no longer threatened and the bald eagle is off the endangered list.

What will happen if you drive your car at the bottom of Magnetic Hill, Moncton, New Brunswick?	"You won't have to look far to find some natural peculiarity for which science sometimes offer a theory. However, many places are complete unimaginable Some places attract people more than others. The incapability to understand the real story behind some of these phenomena draws many people. They are just so mysterious that there is no explaining it. 1.Blood Falls, Antarctica How is it that the coldest and driest place on the planet has a blood-red waterfall pouring down slowly into the McMurdo Dry Valleys, some of the most extreme desert lands on Earth? What causes the mysterious flow was only recently ""discovered"" in a study. Scientists believed for many years red algae gave the unusual color. But now research has shown that iron oxide is responsible for the hue. The waterfall even contains strange bacterial lifeforms. 2.Magnetic Hill, Moncton, New Brunswick Be very careful if you choose to drive to the bottom of this hill. Stories about what happens there have been around since early 1900s. As impossible as it sounds, your car will start to ""roll"" uphill. ""And it doesn't just work on cars--vans, trucks and even tour buses roll upward in total defiance of natural law,"" according to Tourism New Brunswick. 3.Racetrack Playa, Death Valley, California Located in a remote valley between the Cottonwood and Last Chance Ranges, Racetrack Playa is a place of really beauty and mystery. The Racetrack is a dry lakebed, best known for its strange moving rocks. It looks like they ""sailed"" through the valley. Although no one has actually seen the rocks move, the long moving tracks left behind in the mud surface of the Playa prove their activity. The most logical explanation so far is that ice forms covering the stones, causing them to move."	['The car will run in unusual way.']
What's the main idea of this passage?	"Although mobile phones have brought a lot of convenience to people,they have also brought troubles. Besides endless spam text messages( ),another problem seems even more annoying.That is the so-called ""one ring""call.It is a phone call that only rings one time and stops before the receivers is able to pick it up .When the receiver calls back,the other side is usually a recorded advertisement.And by the time people realize that they have been _ they've already paid for the call. An article in the China Youth Dailysays that these terrible calls trouble many mobile users day and night.But up till now,the government hasn't taken any steps to solve the problem. It seems that if someone chooses to use a cellphone,he must bear( )the trouble. The number of mobile phone users in China has risen to more than 570 million.Thanks to news reports,many people have come to understand the harm of the ""one ring""call.Some users say they won't call back if it is an unknown number.But the article points out that this doesn't mean the related government departments should turn a blind eye to it. According to an online survey of more than 200,000 Chinese netizens ( ), nearly 70 percent believed telecommunication( )operators make money from these annoying phone calls.The article argues that ""one ring""calls not only take away people's money,but also trouble their lives.

According to the author, how should you treat yourself?	"You've heard the saying: if you don't know where you're going, how will you know when you get there. Thousands of successful people attribute (......) most of their success to goal setting. Knowing this, why don't the majority of people set goals? Goal setting starts within you. You have to believe it's possible to do a thing before you have a strong desire to write it down on paper and take steps to make it happen. How do you possibly bring yourself to believe in your own success? After all, so many of you have been at this success thing for a while and it still hasn't happened to you. Companies that you believed in and worked hard for have failed, your family and friends are waiting for you to ""be realistic"", and life just keeps giving you one blow after another. But there is a small fire burning inside you. You keep at it because all you know is you can't continue to get up every morning, go to work for someone else and allow them to determine how much you're worth each week which is far below your true value. So where do you go from here? Where do you start today? The road to inner belief in your success begins with you telling yourself every day, throughout the day, that you can do what you set out to do, you can have what you set out to get, and you can be that successful person you know that lives inside you. Yes, obstacles will come, doubters will be around, but don't you be one of them. Treat yourself like the person you love and care about most. If you had children who had a paper route and they wanted to accomplish a goal but they kept running into obstacles, what would happen? They would soon become discouraged with so many people telling them no. I'm not interested in what you have to offer. What would you say to your child? I'm sure it won't be the same thing you've been saying to yourself. Turn your words around. Speak those same words of encouragement you would speak to your discouraged child, to yourself. If you would never put a loved one down, especially when they are feeling discouraged, why would you do that to yourself? You have the power within to stop it right now and turn it around. Be committed from this point forward to speaking words of encouragement to yourself. The mind is an amazing thing. You can convince yourself of anything over time. If you repeatedly tell yourself every day, throughout the day, how successful you are, how capable you are, you will not only start to believe it, you will start to live it."

How many countries did the couple visit during their honeymoon?	"A newly-wed couple on a four-month honeymoon were hit by six natural disasters, including the Australian floods, Christchurch earthquake and Japanese tsunami. Stefan and Erika Svanstrom left Stockholm, Sweden, on December 6 and were immediately stranded in Munich, Germany, due to one of Europe's worst snowstorms. Travelling with their baby daughter, they flew on to Cairns in Australia which was then struck by one of the most tremendous tonadoes in the nation's history. From there, the couple, in their 20s, were forced to shelter for 24 hours on the cement floor of a shopping centre with 2,500 others. ""Trees were being knocked over and big branches were scattered across the streets,"" Mr Svanstrom told Sweden's Express newspaper. _ They then headed south to Brisbane but the city was experiencing massive flooding, so they crossed the country to Perth where they narrowly escaped raging bush fires. The couple then flew to Christchurch, New Zealand, arriving just after a massive magnitude 6.3 earthquake destroyed the city on February 22. Mrs. Svanstrom said, ""When we got there the whole town was a war zone."" ""We could not visit the city since it was completely blocked off, so instead we travelled around before going to Japan."" But days after the Svanstroms arrived, Tokyo was rocked by Japan's largest earthquake since records began. ""The trembling was horrible and we saw roof tiles fly off the buildings,"" Mr. Svantrom said. ""It was like the buildings were swaying back and forth."" The family returned to Stockholm on March 29,2011 after a much calmer visit to their last destination China. But Mr. Svanstrom, who also survived the destructive Boxing Day tsunami that hit southeast Asia in 2004, said the marriage was still going strong. He added, ""I know marriages have to endure some trials, but I think we have been through most of them."" ""We've certainly experienced more than our fair share of catastrophes, but the most important thing is that we're together and happy."" Mrs. Svantrom added: "" To say we were unlucky with the weather doesn't really cover it! It's so absurd that now we can only laugh."""	['5.']
Who will make good impressions on the boss?	It is important that you make a good impression at work. If you make a good impression on your boss, he or she is more likely to give you more responsibilities which can lead to promotions and raises. Here are some ways to make a good impression at work. Use Proper Office Etiquette Using proper manners will help you make a good impression on your boss and also your co-workers. Office etiquette includes everything from the proper way to e-mails to knowing when, where, and how to use your cell phone at work. Face up to Your Mistakes When you make a mistake at work, which everyone inevitably does at some points, face up to it. Don't ignore your error or place the blame on others. Take responsibility and come up with a solution to fix your mistake. Your boss may not be too happy about it, but she will at least be impressed with your response. Know to Call in Sick Do you think coming to work when you are sick instead of staying at home will impress your boss? Reasonable bosses know that a sick employee not only is unproductive but also he or she can spread an illness around the office. Call in sick when you are ill. Come Through in a Crisis When the unexpected happens at work, who will make a better impression on the boss? Of course it's the employee who deals with the crisis quickly and effectively.

What is the main idea of the passage?	It seems school children all over the world are not satisfied with their school food. Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, said that she would prepare a packed lunch for her son if school dinners do not improve. So what do students of your age eat for lunch at school? Japan High schools have dining halls, which serve everything from noodles to rice, but not hamburgers and chips. Other children bring food from home such as cold rice balls, meat or fish, and vegetables. The United States A common menu from a US school is made up of a hamburger with fried potatoes or roast chicken, fruit and cookies. School lunches must also provide food with protein ,vitamin A, vitamin C, ironand calories. Australia Meat piesand hotdogs are all traditional dishes in Australian school shops. But as the nation pays more attention to children's health, healthier foods have started to find their way onto school menus. Many schools have used a traffic light system. The sale of red-labeled foods includingchocolate and soft drinks, is served only twice a week. Healthier green-labeled foods such as sandwiches, corn and watermelon, however are served every day. In some schools, students have a choice of up to 89 foods to choose from, including popcorn and rice. South Africa Most of South Africa's schools do not serve meals at all. Classes end at 1:30 pm and students get their own lunches. Many students bring food from home, usually sandwiches. Fast food and fried food sell the best among students, which has led to a rise in _ among children. But as more people began to realize the fact that being too fat may cause different illnesses, some schools in towns have led the way towards better nutrition . Now students at these schools are provided with lunches of porridge with vegetables, such as cabbages, carrots and tomatoes.	['Schools serve different foods from country to country.']
Generally speaking , people believe that global warming is caused by _ .	Think about what you usually have for a meal: Is it a hamburger? What about vegetables? Would it surprise you to learn that what you eat can affect the whole planet? It can--in a big way. Scientists attending the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago presented new studies showing how food and its production affect the globe and its warming climate. It is generally believed that global warming is caused by the large amounts of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. One of these greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide. What does this have to do with food? A big part of the carbon dioxide comes from the process of making and eating food, the scientists reported in Chicago. The production of meat contributes to a lot of that carbon dioxide. The process of making a hamburger, for example, requires a lot of energy. A cow has to be fed and raised on farmland, and cow manure is a major source of methane --an especially powerful greenhouse gas. By the time a hamburger is finally served on a dinner plate, it has done great harm to the environment. The message from the research is clear: We can greatly reduce the production of greenhouse gases by eating less meat. All kinds of meat, the scientists reported, are harder on the planet than vegetables. To grow and eat a pound of potatoes, for example, sends less than one-quarter pound of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the air. So shifting our diet to less meat and more vegetables ,as it turns out, may do the world some good.	['releasing too many greenhouse gases.']
Which of the following statements is WRONG?	While applying to college may seem easy, getting in can be tough! When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college.	"[""One doesn't have to send his test scores to the intended college.""]"
What' s the purpose of writing the passage?	Have you heard of the movie Benji off the Leashf This Benji story7 begins when his mother, a pretty black furry dog, escapes from the puppy mill with Colby, a boy who loves her.He tries to hide her in an abandoned house.The boy' s father discovers her there and takes mother and pups back home to the puppy mill, but leaves Benji behind because he doesn't look purebred enough to be sold for money.Colby comes back later to rescue the tiny puppy and keeps Benji in his wooden clubhouse, bringing Mom to come to visit him in secret. As Benji grows bigger, it becomes harder to keep him in the clubhouse, and eventually the boy' s father discovers him and Benji is forced to flee to the streets.But despite his fear of Colby' s father, Benji cannot forget about his mother, who is growing steadily weaker and sicker.He continues to sneak back to the puppy mill yard to spy on the goings-on there and plan a way to rescue her. Benji's doggie pal, Scrappy enters the story when he is pushed out of a car into a country lane.Once his paws hit the ground, Scrappy wags his tail once helplessly after the car as it drives away, and then is immediately up to his neck in hapless mischief . Scrappy is a lovably stupid little dog who barely manages to escape the animal control officers who are determined to catch him. One of the wonderful things about this movie is that the two stars are not highly trained purebred dogs.Both Benji and Scrappy were rescued mixed breed dogs found at local animal shelters.Adorable Benji and his stupid pal, Scrappy, demonstrate that mixed-breed rescue dogs are just as intelligent and trainable as any purebred dog. Benji Off the Leash clearly demonstrates the connection between people who abuse animals and people who abuse people.Colby' s father takes out his anger on those who are weaker than him, namely by frightening his wife and the dogs.He attempts to frighten Colby, but the boy bravely refuses to let him. Children who are used to fast-paced action films with catchy theme songs may not have the patience for the slower pace of this film.But for rescue volunteers, older children, and anyone who loves dogs, this is a heartwarming movie that shows how even in today' s world of deserted dogs and backyard puppy mills, there can still be happy endings for homeless dogs.

Which commercial usage of the Internet does the author NOT refer to?	"The Internet began in the 1960s as a small network of academic and government computers primarily involved in research for the prefix = st1 /U.S.army. Originally limited to researchers at a handful of universities and government departments, the Internet has quickly become a worldwide network providing users with information on a range of subjects and allowing them to purchase goods directly from companies via computer. By 1999, 84 millionU.S.citizens had access to the Internet at home or work. More and more Americans arc paying bills, shopping, ordering airline tickets, and purchasing stocks via computer over the Internet. Internet banking is also becoming increasingly popular. With lower overhead costs in terms of staffing and office space, Internet banks are able to offer higher interest rates on deposits and charge lower rates on loans than traditional banks. ""Brick and mortar"" banks are increasingly offering online banking services via some special websites to enlarge their traditional services. At present, 14 percent of Internet households conduct their banking by means of the Internet, and the figure is expected to double during the next two or three years. Increasing commercial use of the Internet has heightened security and privacy concerns. With a credit card, an Internet user can order almost anything from an Internet site and have it delivered to their home or office. Companies doing business over the Internet need many security measures to protect credit card, bank account, and social security numbers from unauthorized access as they pass across the Internet. Any organization that connects its networks to the global Internet must carefully control the access point to ensure that out-siders cannot disturb the organization's internal networks or gain unauthorized access to the organization's computer systems and data."

According to the passage we can know that _ .	"When doctors urge overweight kids to pick up more activities,reading probably isn't what they have in mind. Yet a new study by fatness researchers at Duke University finds that the simple act of reading--depending on the choice of material--can cause weight loss in teenage girls. The study's experimental group included 31 fat girls aged 9 to 13,who took part in the Healthy Lifestyles Program at Duke Children's Hospital. The girls read a novel called Lake Rescue,whose protagonist is an overweight teenager who struggles with low selfesteem,feelings of loneliness and teasing because of her size. A group of 33 girls read a different book called Charlotte in Paris,which did not have an overweight character,and another group of 17 girls read neither book. At the end of the sixmonth experiment,all the girls who read books had lost weight,but the girls who read Lake Rescue lost more. They lowered their body mass index (BMI) by 0.71,compared with 0.33 in the Charlotte group,an average 0.05 increase among the nonreaders. The idea behind the study,says Dr Sarah Armstrong,director of Healthy Lifestyles,was to find a way to encourage the girls without adopting the restrictive and often authoritative voice of so many other nutrition and diet programs. Lake Rescue was the perfect instrument,says Armstrong;it presents a likable character to whom the girls could relate and whom they could learn from. As the book progresses,its protagonist learns to make healthier lifestyle choices and finds an adviser to help keep her on track. Armstrong says,"" _ learns that she can become healthier,and the 'I can do it' feeling resonates with the teenage girls."""	['different reading materials play different roles in losing weight']
Why couldn't the writer go on sleeping that night?	I was sleeping soundly last night when I was awakened by someone's groans .I listened , and heard it was from Sam,a student from Africa. I really wanted to go on sleeping, as I had insomnia and had just fallen asleep, but I couldn't because Sam groaned louder and louder,showing he was seriously ill. At that time , Robbie,a student from China , also got up to help. We found some pills,got some water , and helped him sit up to take them, hoping this would make his pain go down a little and get over the difficult time. If only daytime would come soon, everything would become easier. Things went contrary)to our wishes. Sam's condition developed from bad to worse. We telephoned the emergency service , and in no time an ambulance stopped in front of our gate. We helped the medical workers carry Sam to the vehicle,and then both Robbie and I got in and took Sam to the hospital. We helped him go through many medical examinations. After all kinds of tests,we were told that the final diagnosis was appendicitis . Luckily , Sam didn't need an operation because we brought him to the hospital in time. He got timely treatment.

Why did the boy have tears in his eyes in the end?	"Before I had my son, I spent two years working with children with disabilities. I learned that shouting and threats of punishment would result in a disaster. Coming up against their behaviour could only make the job harder and their behaviour more extreme. I found something that worked, though. There was a very naughty boy in the nursery and a teacher who was generally very confident with the children was asked to take charge of him. One day the boy joined a session in the room next to mine. His appearance created an atmosphere of tension. He spent the entire session running around, hitting and kicking, and destroying property. I was in the craft room working with some other children when my co-worker told me that this boy's teacher was in tears, and could not get control of the situation. As we were talking,the boy ran in. I told my co-worker that I would take care of him. I closed the door. He was full of energy, throwing things around and making a huge mess. But I could see that he was doing all these to annoy me. He needed connection, and this was the only way he knew how to ask for it. So I sat back down and kept quiet. Then he slowed down and began making a rocket. I talked to him about it. We continued like this for a few minutes before I slipped into the conversation: ""So what happened today?"" It was purely a question, no blame or anger in my tone. I believe that if I had criticized him, the gate that was slowly opening would have shut firmly closed. He told me that the teacher didn't let him do what he knew well due to safety but asked him to do what he disliked. He also admitted that he had enjoyed making her run around and saw it as a game. I explained that his teacher had not seen it as a game and was very upset. This again was stated simply as a fact. I suggested that next time he had a session, he talk about what he hoped to do at the start,which might be easier for everyone. He agreed and was quiet for a moment. Then he looked at me with tears in his eyes before quietly asking if he could go to find his teacher to apologize."	['He was regretful about his behavior.']

From Schumer's words we can learn that _ .	"To help the environment, many Americans have made the change from paper and plastic bags to reusable grocery bags. But a report by a Florida newspaper says that reusable grocery bags sold by some supermarkets contain high levels of lead . Lead is a metal that can be harmful to humans, especially young children. Now, Senator Charles Schumer is asking the US government to investigate the use of lead in reusable shopping bags. ""When our families go to the grocery store looking for safe and healthy foods to feed their kids, the last thing they should have to worry about is poisonous bags."" Schumer said, ""A quick investigation will allow everyone to make informed, timely decisions."" Schumer added. Lead in the bags is not likely to rub off on food. But over time, paint on the bags can chip and the bags can wear out. When this happens, lead can be released . The Tampa Tribune newspaper said certain bags sold at Publix and Winn-Dixie supermarkets had lead levels that were a concern to health officials. The affected bags were found in Florida. But Publix has more than 1,000 stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Sough Carolina and Tennessee. Publix says that all of its bags are under current laws about lead content, but that they have asked the makers of the bags to reduce the lead levels in the product. The bags with the highest levels of lead had fancy designs and many pictures. Plain reusable bags without decoration were found to contain little lead. Consumers worried about lead levels in reusable bags can change to cloth or string bags. Paper bags are also a good choice, since paper can be recycled . Since 2007, Publix supermarkets have sold more than 13 million reusable bags. The store says because shoppers have made the change to reusable bags, it has saved more than 1 billion paper and plastics bags."	['people will be informed of the facts about the reusable bags']

According to the passage, a partial lunar eclipse occurs _ .	Many people are aware of the beauty of a solar eclipse , but are surprised to learn that lunar eclipses are often just as impressive. While total solar eclipse lasts only for a few minutes and can be seen only in a small area of a few kilometers, total lunar eclipse can last for several hours and can be seen over much of the planet. In fact, the beauty and _ of lunar eclipses make them a favorite of both amateur and professional photographers. Lunar eclipses generally occur two or three times a year, and are possible only when the Moon is full. When we see the Moon, we are actually seeing sunlight reflected off the surface of the Moon When the Earth is positioned in between the Moon and the Sun, however, the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, and a lunar eclipse occurs. The type of lunar eclipse - total, partial, or penumbral - that occurs depends both on how much of the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow and through which part of the shadow it passes. A penumbral eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth's outer shadow. This type of eclipse is brief and frequently goes unobserved by all but astronomers. By contrast, total and partial eclipses occur when all or part, respectively, of the Moon passes through the umbra shadow of the Earth. These eclipses are quite easy to see and are widely observed. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to watch. Solar radiation that occurs during an eclipse of the Sun can cause a form of burns of one's eyes known as eclipse blindness. In fact, the only way to safely view a solar eclipse is by using specially designed equipment.

It can be inferred from the passage that in the past _ .	Some years ago industries had more freedom than they have now, and they did not need to be as careful as they must today. They did not need to worry a lot about the safety of the new products that they developed. They did not have to pay much attention to the health and safety of the people who worked for them. Often new products were dangerous for the people who used them; often conditions in the work place had very bad effects on the health of the workers. Of course sometimes there were real disasters which attracted the attention of governments and which showed the need for changes. Also scientists who were doing research into the health of workers sometimes produced information which governments could not ignore. At such times, they inquire into the causes of the disasters or the problems. New safety rules were often introduced as a result of these inquiries; however. the new rules came too late to protect the people who died or who became seriously ill. Today many governments have special departments which protect customers and workers.In the U.S, for example, there is a department which tests new airplanes and gives warnings about possible problems. It also makes the rules that aircraft producers must follow. Another department controls the foods and drugs that companies sell. A third department looks at the places where people work. and then reports any companies that are breaking the laws which protect the health and safety of workers. Of course, new government departments and new laws cannot prevent every accident or illness. but they are having some good results. Our work places are safer and cleaner than before. The planes and cars which we use for travel are better. Producers are thinking more about the safety and health of the people who buy and use their products.

How did Lisa feel about her weight at first?	"Lisa has always been overweight. She wanted to lose weight, not just because she wanted to look more beautiful and healthier, but also because it would make life easier. For example, it was difficult for Lisa to find ready-made clothes that would fit. She had to ask a tailor to make clothes that were large enough. In school, she needed a special chair which was bigger and stronger than the other chairs. If she went for a walk, she got tired very quickly. She was also unhappy about the way people treated her sometimes. ""People look at me and even make fun of me. That's unfair! It's true that I'm overweight, but I don't think people should treat me differently because I'm big. I can't enjoy having dinner with my friends because I'm afraid of getting fatter. ""Her friends and family never made fun of her. They tried to help her instead. They wanted her to be happy and healthy. Sometimes when Lisa was feeling sad, she didn't want to speak to anyone. But now things are quite different. Last month her classmates were preparing for the School Art Week. Someone advised Lisa to play the lead role of the Proud Queen who was tall and fat. Lisa agreed and practiced a lot. Soon after the play, Lisa became the star! She did so well that everybody remembered the Proud Queen. They stood around her and said ""Congratulations""to her.

What is the best title of this passage?	I never knew how amazing it would feel to help a family 4,560 miles away from my home. I never knew how great an effect I could have on that single family. From the moment I walked into French class, I knew almost instantly that I belonged there. My teacher, Madame Weiser, is a kind and caring woman, and is the person who started the interest within me to help a family abroad, no matter how many miles apart. Back in 2011, my teacher traveled as a tourist to Maxi, a country settled in West Africa with a large French-speaking population. She didn't expect to adopt an entire family, but fate had other plans. Madame met a nice man named Monsieur Diarra, a driver who had shown her the way through the dry lands of Mali. Mali is now a war-torn country and unsafe for tourists to visit, leaving little work for taxi drivers. Madame Weiser realized how Monsieur Driarra's family struggled on a daily basis, for he had a wife and four children to support as well as their grandmother, so she made a final decision to send the family as much money as she could raise every month. Now, three years later, Madame Weiser has still kept up her fund, collecting money from family and friends as well as students to support _ . It has become more than just my teacher donating to her adopted family abroad. As president of French Club at my high school and a French Honor Society member, I decided that our club should work to raise money for the family in need. By washing cars, we raised over $1,000. From my experience, I've learned that making an effort is worth more than anything. Its effect is priceless!	['The Love for Africa.']
When did Linda become conscious again?	"Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him. She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained."	['After she was back on the platform.']
Which activity is the most popular with young French people?	"Many French academics,teachers and parents complain because they feel that intellectual levels are falling rapidly!The figures prove it:young people visit museums less,spend their lives chatting on the Internet,read nothing but Stephen King,while watching American soaps such as Friends or reality shows like Star Academy on television,music player glued to their cars,and the games console handy. It is,however,easy to see these habits in a positive light.Music is the favorite leisure activity:86% of 14-to18-year-olds put it at the top of their activities,above the cinema(71%),clubbing(68%),sport(56%) and television(48%).For 90% of young people aged 14to 18,radio is also very popular:they listen to it every day without exception.International popular music has a strong showing,but songs in French are still in the majority(60%). Young people do,of course,watch a lot of television,but less than their elders,and if they tend to choose mostly soaps and reality TV shows,that is because these are the programs people talk about,which encourages social interaction.Do young people read less than they used to?Maybe,but that's also true of the elders.Young people still read more than their elders.When asked,""Do you like reading?"",94% of 14-to-18-year-olds say they do,and 81% are convinced that computers will never replace books. Contrary to popular belief,reading continues to occupy an extremely important place in leisure-time activities,but the reading matter young people choose has changed considerably:there is a greater variety of media(computers and new technologies) and young people admit to taste they would perhaps have been ashamed of in the past.For example,comic strips,Stenphen King or other authors not recognized by mainstream culture,such as Betty Mahmoody (Not Without My Daughter),Mary Higgins Clark or Jostein Gaader (Sophie's World).As Beatrice Toulon,Editor in Chief of the magazine Phosphore,see it,""They don't read the same things as their parents did,but they are not afraid to admit it.They have their own culture,which they flaunt openly!"""

It can be inferred that when the author covers for his brother at work,_.	It's certain:for twins,life really does imitate art.My twin brother,Kirk,and I grew up being constantly mistaken for each other.Classmates,friends,teachers,even relatives couldn't tell us apart. As a result,we were often unfairly punished or rewarded. Eventually,we learned how to use the Mistaken Identity Syndrome (MIS) to our advantage.For example,we would play tricks on our friends and classmates,pretending to be the other twin.Nor were teachers immune to our tricks.On at least one occasion,when Kirk was sick,I covered for him by taking his tests.We also tried our little game out on Mom,but she always knew who was who.Once we grew up,we even covered for each other at work.We didn't mean any harm;we simply started this as an experiment to see whether our bosses and co-workers could tell the difference. As a bank manager, I meet with dozens of clients on a daily basis, while my brother manages a staffing service for local employers. As a result, Kirk is constantly approached by people who want to discuss their various money accounts, while I'm frequently thanked on the street as a department store customer service representative. However, the MIS took a truly embarrassing turn when Kirk and I found ourselves unable to tell each other apart. Once, my brother and I were traveling in a car with several friends. My brother's hair must always be in place. Kirk was driving when he noticed in the rearview mirror that his hair was a bit messy. He lifted his right hand to brush his hair back into place and was disturbed when his hand didn't appear in the mirror. Several times he repeated this action. Finally, he started laughing.

What do the directors mentioned in the passage have in common _ ?	There are many great movie directors of all time and the following are five of those who have largely impressed audience with their body of work. As a member of the New Hollywood gang, Francis Coppola is best remembered for The God Father series. His decision to cast Marlon Brando in the lead also met with fierce opposition from the studio bosses. Good sense became popular, and The God Father went on to become one of the most memorable movies ever. Critics may point out that he has become less creative after his seventies, but try as one might, no one can possibly take the place of this great director's work. Stanley Kubrick's movies focus on the themes like sci-fi, horror, dark humor and war. He used symbolism in most of his movies, giving us some wonderful screen visuals, as shown in 2001: A Space Odyssey. His actors in Hollywood complained about the endless number of retakes, but they appreciated the performance he milked out of them. People argue about films like Lolita, A Clockwork Orange and Paths of Glory, but these are now seen as classics. Steven Spielberg is a great success at the box office, and he is one of the world's most popular filmmakers today. As the creator of classics like Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, ET, Indiana Jones series, Jaws, Saving Private Ryan, no one can win his hold over the audience. His critics accuse him of being emotional and over the top, _ Woody Allen is a director who directs movies full of crime and hate. This comic genius has given us Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters and Midnight in Paris, which have also become classical. His movies constantly include characters who arouse the audience's sympathy and laughter at the same time, as they set out on a journey of self-discovery. Hollywood star power has never fazed Allen. Thankfully, awards and honors do not interest him, which results in creativity that is original.	['They have created a lot of movies taken as classics.']
"It can be inferred that ""stith"" was the sound made by _ ."	"One day in spring four men were riding on horseback along a country road. These men were lawyers, and they were going to the next town to attend court. There had been a rain, and the ground was very soft. Water was dripping from the trees, and the grass was wet. The four lawyers rode along, one behind another, for the pathway was narrow, and the mud on each side of it was deep. They rode slowly, and talked and laughed and were very cheerful. As they were passing through a group of small trees, they heard a great fluttering over their heads and a weak sound made by small birds in the grass by the roadside. ""Stith! Stith! Stith!"" came from the leafy branches above them. ""Cheep! cheep! cheep!"" came from the wet grass. ""What is the matter here?"" asked the first lawyer, whose name was Speed. ""Oh, it's only some old robins !""said the second lawyer, whose name was Hardin. ""The storm has blown two of the little ones out of the nest. They are too young to fly, and the mother bird is worried about them."" ""What a pity! They'll die down there in the grass,"" said the third lawyer. ""Oh, well! They're nothing but birds,"" said Mr. Hardin. ""Why should we bother?"" ""Yes, why should we?"" said Mr. Speed. The three men, as they passed, looked down and saw the little birds fluttering in the cold, wet grass. They saw the mother robin flying about, and crying to her mate. Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. In a few minutes they had forgotten about the birds. But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got down from his horse and very gently took the little ones up in his big warm hands. They did not seem frightened, but cried softly, as if they knew they were safe. ""Never mind, my little fellows,"" said Mr. Lincoln ""I will put you in your own cozy little bed."" Then he looked up to find the nest from which they had fallen. It was high, much higher than he could reach. But Mr. Lincoln could climb. He had climbed many a tree when he was a boy. He put the birds softly, one by one, into their warm little home. Two other baby birds were there that had not fallen out. All cuddled down together and were very happy. Soon the three lawyers who had ridden ahead stopped at a spring to give their horses water. ""Where is Lincoln?"" asked one. All were surprised to find that he was not with them. ""Do you remember those birds?"" said Mr. Speed. ""Very likely he has stopped to take care of them."" In a few minutes Mr. Lincoln joined them. His shoes were covered with mud; he had torn his coat on the thorny tree. ""Hello, Abraham!"" said Mr. Hardin. ""Where have you been?"" ""I stopped a minute to give those birds to their mother,"" he answered. ""Well, we always thought you were a hero,"" said Mr. Speed. ""Now we know it."" Then all three of them laughed heartily. They thought it so foolish that a strong man should take so much trouble just for some worthless young birds. ""Gentlemen,"" said Mr. Lincoln, ""I could not have slept tonight, if I had left those helpless little robins to die in the wet grass."" Abraham Lincoln afterwards became very famous as a lawyer and statesman. He was elected president. Next to Washington he was the greatest."	['the mother bird']
Specialization and the effort to increase yields have resulted in _ .	"Sustainable development is applied to just about everything from energy to clean water and economic growth, and as a result it has become difficult to question either the basic assumptions behind it or the way the concept is put to use. This is especially true in agriculture, where sustainable development is often taken as the measure of progress without a proper appreciation of historical and cultural perspectives. To start with, it is important to remember that the nature of agriculture has changed markedly throughout history, and will continue to do so. Medieval agriculture in northern Europe fed, clothed and sheltered a mainly rural society with a much lower population density than it is today. It had minimal effect on biodiversity, and any pollution it caused was typically localized. In terms of energy use and the nutrients captured in the product it was relatively inefficient. Contrast this with farming since the start of the industrial revolution. Competition from overseas led farmers to specialize and increase yields. Throughout this period food became cheaper, safer and more reliable. However, these changes have also led to habitat loss and to reducing biodiversity. All this means that agriculture in the 21st century will have to be very different from how it was in the 20th. This will require thorough thinking. For example, we need to move away from the idea that traditional practices are certainly more sustainable than new ones. We also need to abandon the notion that agriculture can be ""zero impact"". The key will be to abandon the rather simple and static measures of sustainability, which centre on the need to maintain production without increasing damage. Instead we need a more dynamic interpretation, one that looks at the pros and cons of all the various way land is used. There are many different ways to measure agricultural performance besides food yield: energy use, environmental costs, water purity, carbon footprint and biodiversity. It is clear, for example, that the carbon of transporting tomatoes from Spain to the UK is less than that of producing them in the UK with additional heating and lighting. But we do not know whether lower carbon footprints will always be better for biodiversity. What is important is recognizing that sustainable agriculture is not just about sustainable food production."	['the decrease of biodiversity']
From the passage, we can infer that _	"SANTA MONICA, Calif. (KABC)A Santa Monica High School teacher who was put on leave after using physical force to control a student who was selling marijuana in his classroom has received surprising support on Facebook. The incident was captured on video and has caused a sudden reaction from parents, teachers, students and even graduates. They are showing their support for Black. A Facebook page supporting ""Coach Black"" has over 4,700 likes. And many want him back in the classroom. Student witnesses say Mark Black, who is also the wrestling coach, tried to confiscate a bag of marijuana and was then injured by the student with a pencil. The cellphone video shows Black locking the student's legs and pinning the student to the ground. ""He just wanted him to stop and he was trying to be a teacher and help, and I don't think it was his fault."" said student Kylan Townsend. School Board member Oscar De La Tone says Mr. Black is one of his teachers at Santa Monica High School. ""I know him very well. I know him to be a fair person, a good person, someone who cares deeply about his students,"" said De La Torre. He says that the video does not tell the whole story and that the incident brings to light the issue of drug use, something the district needs to address. But in an email to parents, Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Superintendent Sandra Lyon says the teacher's behavior is ""absolutely alarming."" She put Black on leave during an independent investigation. Lyon has come under fire from parents for initially saying the kind of physical action used by the teacher was unacceptable. On Saturday, Lyon released the following statement to Eyewitness News: ""I want to stress that teachers are at times confronted with difficult, even threatening situations, and they must make judgment calls to protect safety. I want to emphasize that putting the teacher who was involved in this incident on leave until completion of an independent investigation is a matter of standard policy and practice; it in no way prejudices the outcome of the investigation."" Students hope the situation will have a quick and just resolution. An online petition pas also peen createu by one of Black's former students. The petition has already gained thousands of signatures.Black did not respond to a request for comment."	['no decision has been made from the investigation yet']
This passage is probably a _ .	"There are many colors in nature. But do you know if a color has weight? I think you'll say ""no"". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment. First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the box. Third, wrap one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. OK. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why do you think so? A scientist found that different colors have different weights in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every color has its own weight in our mind and their order is the same. The heaviest color is red, then blue, green, yellow and white. The scientist told us that colors also have smell. Can you smell the color? Of course not. Then why did the scientist say so? That is because every color stands for a kind of light with a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain through sense organs . According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colors they like, and refuse the colors they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colors you like. Or you'll be nervous or ill. For example, if you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only an hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall. That means our body temperature will change with different colors."	['science report']
Why did Joyce end up unemployed and homeless?	"Today I was at the mall waiting for friends, when a lady wearing a knit hat and a sweater came up to me and, shivering, said, ""I'm homeless. Would you mind buying me some food?"" In that split second, everything I'd learned since kindergarten flashed through my mind. Don't talk to strangers ... Be a good citizen ... People will take advantage of you ... Treat others as you wish to be treated ... The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return ... I guess love won the debate. ""Sure,"" I said. ""What would you like?"" She thought and then said, ""I'd like to get Chinese food."" We headed upstairs. On the way she told me about when she was a teenager. She remembers taking pictures for the yearbook with her best friend. She was in the band and played basketball. She got good grades and was a good student. She ordered soup, an egg roll, white rice, and pepper chicken. I would normally think that was a lot, but she had probably barely eaten in the last few days. I got my usual - lo mein and General Tso's chicken. As we ate, we got to know each other. She asked if I played any instruments. I replied that I played the violin, cello, and guitar. She told me she played the flute, piano, guitar, and violin. In the middle of our meal, I realized something. And she thought of it at exactly the same time. ""So, what's your name?"" she asked. ""I'm Claire,"" I said, startled at our exact same thought. ""What's yours?"" ""Joyce,"" she said with a smile. We continued talking, and she asked my favorite subjects in school and if I wanted to go to college. ""Hopefully,"" I replied. ""I'm interested in nursing."" ""I went to college for nursing,"" she said. I was taken aback. How could we have so much in common? Was she pretending so I'd feel sympathy for her? But her eyes were genuine as she said this. Meanwhile I was eating my lo mein, picking around the cabbage and the other vegetables. Joyce said, ""If you don't like it you can take it back."" I told her that I liked it, but was not fond of the vegetables. She broke into a big grin. ""You don't like vegetables, huh? Neither did I. But now I do."" I immediately felt guilty. How could I be picking at my food across from someone who barely gets to eat at all? I tried my best to finish, but she seemed to sense my guilt and said, ""You don't have to eat it if you don't want it."" How could she know what I was feeling? I told her the dish was my favorite, but I just eat slowly. She replied, ""I used to like lo mein, but pepper chicken was my dad's favorite, so I get that now."" Noticing that she used the word ""was,"" I assumed her dad had passed away. I found it sweet that she gave up her favorite in order to honor her dad. She asked why I was at the mall. ""I'm waiting for friends. We're going to see 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'"" I replied, stumbling over the words a bit. ""'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'"" she echoed in awe. ""What's that about?"" I realized that she didn't see commercials for movies. I explained the basic plot and she chuckled. ""A man who is born 80 years old and ages backwards! That sounds interesting."" She got up to get a to-go box. ""Would you like one?"" she asked, but I refused. I realized that this food would probably last her for a few days, and I was glad she had ordered a lot. ""Would you like these?"" I asked, gesturing at the food I had left untouched. ""Oh, no, thank you,"" she said. ""This is enough."" I got up to throw my tray away, feeling guilty about wasting so much. ""I need to meet my friends now,"" I explained. ""It was so nice to meet you, Joyce."" ""You too, Claire,"" she replied with a smile. ""Thank you."" I headed to the theater, and she went back downstairs. It sounds like a perfect coincidence, but I can't help but think that some force compelled us to meet. I kept puzzling, Why is Joyce homeless? It seems so unfair. She shouldn't need people to buy her dinner. She was a nurse. She got good grades. She took pictures for her yearbook. She was the person I hope to be in the future. What went wrong? How could such a good life be rewarded with horrible luck? I feel lucky to have run into Joyce. She changed my outlook. She is still a wonderful person, despite what the world has done to her. I wish her the best, and can only hope that the force that brought us together will help her find what she deserves in life."	['The reason is not yet given.']
Which of the following is right according to the passage?	"Passage 4 From the world's heaviest apple, the oldest lady to the world's smallest dog, these are all parts of a group of the world's strangest people and things. And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ). The book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world. People now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? ""It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world."" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport. The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it! The newest book came out last Tuesday. This book has a lot of interesting records. Here are two: A British dog, Whitney, is the world's smallest dog. It's only 76mm tall. An American woman Lee Redmond has the longest fingernails .They grew as long as 600 mm! She made the record in 1971."	['The Guinness Book of Records started in the year 1954.']

Which of the following shows that the generation gap is disappearing?	"Parents and kids today dress alike, listen to the same music, and are friends. Is this a good thing? Sometimes, when Mr. Ballmer and his 16-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, listen to rock music together and talk about interests they both enjoy, such as pop culture, he remembers his more distant relationship with his parents when he was a teenager. ""I would never have said to my mom, 'Hey, the new Weezer album is really great. How do you like it?'"" says Ballmer. ""There was just a complete gap in taste."" Music was not the only _ . From clothing and hairstyles to activities and expectations, earlier generations of parents and children often appeared to move in separate orbits. Today, the generation gap has not disappeared, but it is getting narrow in many families. Conversations on subjects such as sex and drugs would not have taken place a generation ago. Now they are comfortable and common. And parent--child activities, from shopping to sports, involve a feeling of trust and friendship that can continue into adulthood. No wonder greeting cards today carry the message, ""To my mother, my best friend."" But family experts warn that the new equality can also result in less respect for parents. ""There's still a lot of strictness and authority on the part of parents out there, but there is a change happening,"" says Kerrie, a psychology professor at Lebanon Valley College. ""In the middle of that change, there is a lot of confusion among parents."" Family researchers offer a variety of reasons for these evolving roles and attitudes. They see the 1960s as a turning point. Great cultural changes led to more open communication and a more democratic process that encourages everyone to have a say. ""My parents were on the 'before' side of that change, but today's parents, the 40-year-olds, were on the 'after' side,"" explains Mr. Ballmer. ""It's not something easily done by parents these days, because life is more difficult to understand or deal with, but sharing interests does make it more fun to be a parent now."""

The man got angry because _ .	"Once upon a time in Greece there lived a clever man. His name was Aesop. One day, when Aesop was taking a walk in the country, a man on the road stopped him. He said, ""Kind sir, can you tell me how soon I can get to town?"" ""Go,"" Aesop answered. ""Of course I know I must go,"" said the man,"" But I want to know how soon I can get to town."" ""Go,"" Aesop shouted to him again. The man got angry. ""He must be mad,"" he thought. And he walked away. Suddenly he heard Aesop shouting to him, ""You will get to town in two hours.""The man was in great surprise. He turned back and asked, ""Why didn't you tell me that before?"" ""How could I tell you that before?"" answered Aesop. ""I didn't know how fast you could walk."""	"[""he didn't know what Aesop meant""]"
The author gradually realizes her mother's English is _ .	"I am a writer. I spend a great deal of my time thinking about the power of language--the way it can evoke an emotion, a visual image, a complex idea, or a simple truth. _ . And I use them all--all the Englishes I grew up with. Born into a Chinese family that had recently arrived in California, I've been giving more thought to the kind of English my mother speaks. Like others, I have described it to people as ""broken"" English. But I feel embarrassed to say that. It has always bothered me that I can think of no way to describe it other than""broken"", as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed, as if it lacked a certain wholeness. I've heard other terms used, ""limited English,"" for example. But they seem just as bad, as if everything is limited, including people's perceptions of the limited English speaker. I know this for a fact, because when I was growing up, my mother's ""limited"" English limited my perception of her. I was ashamed of her English. I believed that her English reflected the quality of what she had to say. That is, because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect. And I had plenty of evidence to support me: the fact that people in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously, did not give her good service, pretended not to understand her, or even acted as if they did not hear her. I started writing fiction in 1985. And for reasons I won't get into today, I began to write stories using all the Englishes I grew up with: the English she used with me, which for lack of a better term might be described as ""broken"" ; and what I imagine to be her translation of her Chinese, her internal language, and for that I sought to preserve the essence, but neither an English nor a Chinese structure. I wanted to catch what language ability tests can never show: her intention, her feelings, the rhythms of her speech and the nature of her thoughts."	['rich in meaning']
The writer discusses the marriage of young adults in order to show which of the following?	"Upon reaching an appropriate age (usually between 18 and 21 years), children are encouraged, but not forced, to ""leave the nest"" and begin an independent life. After children leave home, they often find social relationship and financial support outside the family. Parents do not arrange marriages for their children, nor do children usually ask permission of their parents to get married. Romantic love is most often the basis for marriage in the United States; young adults meet their future spouses through other friends, at jobs, and in organizations and religious institutions. Although children choose their own spouses, they still hope their parents will approve of their choices. In many families, parents feel that children should make major life decisions by themselves. A parent may try to influence a child to follow a particular profession but the child is free to choose another career. Sometimes children do exactly the opposite of what their parents wish in order to be independent. A son may decide not to go into his father's business on purpose because of a fear that he will lose his autonomy in his father's workplace. This independence from parents is not an indication that parents and children do not love each other. Strong love between parents and children is universal and this is no exception in the American family. Coexisting with such love in the American family are cultural values of self-reliance and independence."	['They have independence.']
What would be the best title for the text?	"When you're lying on the white sands of the Mexican Rivera, thestresses of the world seem a million miles away. Hey, stop! This is no vacation--you have to finish something. Here lies the problem for travel writer and foodcritic Edie Jarolim.

Now you can read her travel advice everywhere--- inArts and Antiques, inBrides, or in one of her three books,The Complete Idiot Travel Guide to Mexican Beach Resorts. Her job in travel writing began some eight years ago. After getting a PhD in English in Canada, she took a test for Frommer's travel guides, passed it, and got the job. After working at Frommer's, Jarolim worked for a while at Rough Guides in London, then Fodor's where she fell so in love with a description of the Southwest of the U.S. that she moved there. Now as a travel writer, she spends one-third of her year on the road. The rest of the time is spent completing her tasks and writing reviews of restaurants at home in Tucson, Arizona. As adventurous as the job sounds, the hard part is fact-checking all the information.

According to the passage, the report was written by _ .	"Global warming and changing climatic conditions are triggering disease epidemics in wildlife around the world, reports a famous team of ecologists and epidemiologists in the Friday June 21st issue of Science. ""What is most surprising is the fact that climate sensitive outbreaks are happening with so many different types of pathogens ----viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites----as well as in such a wide range of hosts including corals, oysters, terrestrial plants, birds, and humans, "" says lead author Drew Harvell of Cornell University. ""This isn't just a question of coral bleaching for a few marine ecologists, nor just a question of malaria for a few health officials---the number of similar increases in disease incidence is astonishing,"" says coauthor Richard Ostfeld from the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook prefix = st1 /New York. ""We don't want to be alarmists, but we are alarmed."" The team documented examples of viruses, bacteria, and fungi associated with diseases that develop more rapidly with slight rises in temperature. Many vectors of disease such as mosquitoes, flies, and rodents, as well as the viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens are highly temperature and moisture sensitive. As temperature increases, _ are likely to spread into new areas and may have potentially devastating effects on wildlife populations that have not been previously exposed. Reproduction, growth, and biting rates of insects all go up with increases of temperature. Winter is the limiting time for many pathogens, killing back populations each year. With milder winters, this population bottleneck may be removed for many species. Warmer, longer summers also mean that the period of time of disease transmission is longer. Warmer summers may increase host susceptibility to disease due to thermal stress, particularly in the oceans. Marine bacteria and fungal growth rates are positively correlated with increasing temperature."	['A team of ecologists and epidemiologists']
Shakespeare created the following characters EXCEPT _ .	"William Shakespeare is the most famous playwright . Although he died in 1616, people still go to see his plays. Among the most popular are Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Hamlet -- the story of a prince who struggles to respond to the crimes around him. Shakespeare, who was born in 1564, was an actor as well as a writer. Most of his ideas for plays were taken from history, people's conversation, ancient stories, and also from other writers. He wrote not only about kings and queens and princes, but also about friends and ordinary people. He wrote about the cruelty of war and the bravery of heroes, as well as about jealousy, joy, hate, ambition and love. His stories live on. The tragedy Romeo and Juliet was reborn as the musical West Side Story and more recently as the movie Romeo and Juliet with the wonderful performance of Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. He invented a number of great characters: powerful magicians, thrilling witches, smart women and both wise and wicked men. He also invented some great phrases. If you've ever said, ""Oh, for goodness sake!"" you can thank Shakespeare for that. ""To be, or not to be: that is the question,"" Hamlet says. ""Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it is morrow,"" says Juliet to her Romeo. Don't be surprised if you don't understand everything when reading Shakespeare or watching one of his plays because the meanings of many words have changed over the years. And Shakespeare's characters speak in poetry, so their speeches can be complicated. It does help to find out a little bit about the story before reading a Shakespeare play. It's worth the effort. As Shakespeare wrote, ""All the world is a stage."" And in his plays you'll find that an entire world is waiting for you."	['Claire Danes']
Before the new study, it was known that _ .	"A study by St. Louis University has found that a lovable dog named Sparky and a robotic dog AIBO, were about equally effective at reducing the loneliness of nursing home residents. The study confirmed previous findings that dogs have a good effect on nursing home residents . Dr. Andrew Smith led the Stanford University teamat built a home-assistance robot. ""If humans can feel an emotional tie with robots, some day they could be not just our assistants, but also our companions,"" he said. To test whether residents responded better to Sparky, a trained dog, or the Sony-made robotic dog, researchers divided 38 nursing home residents into three groups at three long-term care centers in St, Louis. One group had weekly 30-minute one-on-one visits with Sparky; another group had similar visits with AIBO; a control group had no contact with either dog.The groups' respective levels of loneliness were tested by having them answer a number of questions at the beginning and near the end of the visits. After two months, both groups that had contact with the dogs were less lonely and more attached. Most of the elderly regarded Sparky, a 9-year-old dog, as an audience for their life stories, said investigator Marian Banks. ""He listened attentively, wagged his tail, and allowed them to pet him,"" said Banks, who adopted and trained Sparky after finding him in a street behind her home seven years ago. Those who were together with AIBO took a little longer to warm to the robotic creature.Over time, however, they grew comfortable with him, and petted and talked to him. He would respond by wagging his tail, vocalizing , and blinking his lights. ""AIBO is charming once you start to interact with him,"" said the study's author, Dr. William Banks, "" He's an attractive sort of guy. He gives a feeling: of being personal, not just a robot.

I feel very worried and I really need help. My first problem is about his hobbies, he seems to spend too much time on computer games. As soon as he gets home, he always turns on the computer, closes the door and locks others out.

In a children's hospital,which of the following is true?	"For many people,volunteering is a way of life.Holidays are the time of the year that more people are in a giving mood.Homeless shelters,children's hospitals,and nursing homes are excellent places to give of one's time. Volunteering in Homeless Shelters There is a homeless directory online that anyone can easily access to find the closest homeless shelter to their home.According to the homeless shelter directory,currently there are 3,233 shelters in the US,so it is not difficult to find a shelter.Helping to serve food,picking up donations of food,preparing meals,and cleaning up are things that one can do to help at a homeless shelter. Volunteering in Children's Hospitals Every child needs comfort and joy,especially during the holiday seasons.By visiting sick children in hospitals,an individual provides helping hands by supplementing the services usually done by the hospital staff.Personalizing the hospital experience adds to the comfort and happiness of the children and their families.Volunteers provide help,and positive interactions which enhance the patient's quality of care.Help is needed almost everywhere in a hospital;from the lobby,parking lot,cafeteria,to admitting,helping with the gift cart,and even reading to children in the waiting rooms or their hospital rooms. Volunteering in Nursing Homes According to the National Center for Health Statistics,""Over 50% of those living in nursing homes do not have close relatives and 46% have no living children."" Life in a nursing home is lonely,confusing,and frightening for many residents. Volunteering at a nursing home is a great opportunity to make a difference in someone else's life.Playing cards,sitting with and talking to a resident,taking a walk,or sharing a meal makes a huge difference,especially when they have no other sole on earth to visit them. The three examples above are only a small fraction of institutions in which volunteers are needed.Giving of oneself,especially during the holidays blesses and cheers others."

"The author considers Hillary and Barack ""a surprising pair"" because they are _ ."	"Although the 2008 US presidential elections are still a long way off, candidates are already getting ready for the campaigns ahead. For the Democrats , the two leading candidates are a surprising pair. The first is Hillary Clinton, 60, the wife of former President Bill Clinton. The second is Barack Obama, 45, a Harvard educated senator . It is the first time that the leading presidential candidates for a political party are either a woman or black. The energetic pair has certainly gotten people's attention. But the question remains, is America ready for either one? It's not a simple question to answer. For the past 220 years, Americans have elected only white males to the nation's highest office. That can hardly be called a tradition of diversity. However, many people believe that 2008 will be the year that this changes. ""The white men that have been running the country recently have done such a bad job, at home and abroad, that maybe now is the time for a change,"" said Dorian Cool of San Francisco, California. The polling numbers seem to back up his opinion: 86 percent of Americans say they would vote for a qualified woman. An impressive 93 percent say they would vote for a black man if he seemed right for the job. These numbers are much higher than they were just 20 years ago. They may suggest that Americans are ready to be led by a different type of person. Still, there is a lot to overcome. Although women represent 51 percent of the American population, there are only nine female governors out of 50. Out of 100 senators, only 16 are women. The numbers are significantly lower for blacks in office. Since the American Civil War, only two blacks have been elected governor and only three have been elected to the Senate. Surely both candidates face difficult odds, but never before has there been so much support for either a female or a black candidate. As Barack Obama himself said, ""There is not a black America and a white America, a Latino America and an Asian America -- there's the United States of America."" If others share his vision, maybe the United States will end up with a new type of leader."	['either a woman or black']
How did the author feel after her youngest child entered kindergarten?	Our youngest child eagerly entered kindergarten, while our oldest child excitedly went to college--and I felt left behind. After being very happy as a stay-at-home mother of six children, I suddenly felt stuck on a dead-end road and lacked direction. An inner anxiety troubled me that life was passing by. The road, requiring expensive education, appeared too long and difficult. Thanks to supportive friends and family, I eventually discovered the road sign pointing to the ideal program at an excellent college, which offered a lot of student grants . Driving to my first class, I, aged 40, was eager and nervous. School required sacrifices : weekends for class, sleep for study, and life's luxuries for tuition fees. But the rewards greatly outweighed the cost. The narrow and rocky road developed perseverance and patience, while the smooth and open road built low confidence. Along the way, I met fellow travelers of all ages and interests: a 50-year-old woman who learned photography at the community college; a successful 62-year-old businessman who worked toward a nursing degree to serve in developing countries; an 80-year-old woman who enthusiastically started classes to learn how to surf the Internet, so she could keep up with the world. Twelve years after starting the journey as a non-traditional student, I graduated with a doctoral degree in literature. My children have been especially proud, calling me Dr. Mom. When you hear the small, still voice asking you to do something more or different, remember you can trust your heart.	['She felt both very anxious and helpless.']
What does Dai Yingshuang think of raising pets online?	"Raising pets is a popular online game among teenagers. ""More than 20 of my classmates have adopted pets online."" Said Wang Hui from Beijing. If you go to some websites, you can adopt virtual pets like penguins , chickens, dogs and elephants. You can feed, wash, talk to and play with your pet. Dai Yingshuang of Shanghai said, ""It's great fun and I have also learned how to take care of others."" She usually asks her uncle to take care of her pet while she is at school. If you don't feed and care for the pet, it will become unhappy and unhealthy. So raising an online pet means spending a lot of time online. This makes many parents worried. They fear it will have a bad influence on the children's studies. Wang Zhaotong from Anhui has raised a penguin since last year. She said, ""My parents know about the penguin and think it's okay."" If the students can keep the _ between studying and playing, it's not bad for them to ""raise"" pets online."	"[""It's interesting.""]"

Martha continued to smoke, saying, ""It's my life,"" and so on. I told her if she didn't stop smoking, I wouldn't send her to college. She agreed to give it up. Last night there was cigarette smell on Martha's breath. She had to say she had broken her word. Now I must do what I've said to punish her. Martha is unusually bright and wants to teach children. I'm working full-time to put her older sister through school and would do the same for Martha. My husband's pay is good, but with prices going up all the time we could never educate the girls unless I kept on working. My theory is that if smoking is more important to Martha than college, I'm a fool to work to put her through college."

When you want to get cash out in the 21st century, you will _ .	"To get cash out in the 21st century, you won't need a bank card, a PIN or even have to move a finger. You will simply have to look the cash machine straight in the eye, declares National Cash Registers, a multinational company that makes automated teller machines, or ATMs. NCR has shown its first example machine that is believed to be the future of banking. Instead of asking you for your PIN on a screen, the Super Teller-Stella for short, asks you orally through a loudspeaker to look straight ahead while an infrared camera turns to your head, then your eye, and finally takes an infrared photograph of your iris . For identification purposes, an iris picture is better than a fingerprint, with around 256 noticeable characteristics compared with 40 for fingerprints. This means that the chances of someone else being recognized in your place is about 1 in 1020. Once you've been identified, Stella greets you by name and says: ""Would you like cash or a statement?""

According to the author, the deaths among youth are mainly caused by _ .	Today, as in every other day of the year, more than 3,000 U.S. adolescents will smoke their first cigarette on their way to becoming regular smokers as adults. During their lifetime, it can be expected that of these 3,000 about 23 will be murdered, 30 will die in traffic accidents, and nearly 750 will be killed by a smoking-related disease. The number of deaths due to cigarette smoking outweighs all other factors, whether voluntary or involuntary, as a cause of death. Since the late 1970s, when daily smoking among high school seniors reached 30 percent, smoking rates among youth have declined. While the decline is impressive, several important issues must be raised. First, in the past several years, smoking rates among youth have declined very little. Second, in the late 1970s, smoking among male high school seniors beat that among female by nearly 10 percent . The statistic is reversing . Third, several recent studies have indicate high school _ have excessively high smoking rates, as much as 75 percent . Finally, though significant declines in adolescent smoking have occurred in the past decade, no definite reasons for the decline exist. Within this context, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) began its current effort to determine the most effective measures to reduce smoking level among youth.	['smoking-related disease']
Why did the author's other friends envy Super?	We met in a crowded showroom fifteen years ago. As I inched forward I eyed him with suspicion, unsure what to make of this stranger.A salesman made the proper introductions and although we got to know each other, I didn't trust him. I call him Super. I would find myself staring at him, wondering what secrets he held. I found myself spending more and more time with Super, getting to know him, learning to trust him. My other friends soon became a little jealous, stating that I spent too much time with him. It was true, but I didn't feel guilty, for I could just be myself with him. He didn't care about my appearance, pay and failure. None of these things mattered to him.

Sometimes I won, sometimes he did.It didn't matter because we had fun. Through him I met other people. Men and women I never would have met if it wasn't for him. Then suddenly he became sick. He was unable to do anything and I felt so helpless because I didn't know what was wrong. But I knew those who could.I paced around the room while he was examined.What if it was something serious?

The passage is most probably taken from _ .	You've probably heard of Marco Polo, but how much do you actually know about him and his incredible journey? Marco was the original travel writer, whose trade contacts with Asia changed Europe, opening it up to new ideas and cultures. Marco Polo was born in the Venetian Republic around 1254.At the time, Venice was one of the most powerful trading cities in the world, and was ruled as an independent city state.Marco's mother died when he was young, so he was brought up by his aunt and uncle.When Marco was born, his brother (Maffeo) and father (Niccolo), who were successful merchants, were away on a trading voyage.They didn't get back until Marco was about 15. In 1271, Niccolo and Maffeo set off again for Asia, this time taking Marco with them.On a previous journey they'd met Kublai Khan (the Yuan Dynasty), and they were keen to establish trade links between Kublai's empire and Venice.The Polos sailed across the Mediterranean to Acre (now in northern Israel).Then, they traveled by camel to the port of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.Their plan was to sail to China but they couldn't find any good boats.So, they continued the journey overland, finally meeting Kublai Khan at his summer palace in Xanadu, about 275 kms north of modern Beijing.Marco was now probably 21 years ol The journey had taken over three years. The Polos had learnt a great deal about the world during their travels and so Kublai employed Marco as a government official.This gave Marco the opportunity to travel around much of Kublai's empire in China.In fact, Kublai found the Polos so useful that he was unwilling to let them return home.However, in 1292, the Polos eventually left, sailing from China and ending up in Hormuz again.The journey was extremely dangerous: of the 600 travelers who set off, only 18 arrived in Hormuz, including all three of the Polo family. The Polos finally returned to Venice in 1295, twenty-four years after setting off.They had traveled 24,000 kms.By this time Venice was at war with Genoa, its trade rival.Unfortunately for Marco, he was captured by the Genoese and imprisione However, he used his time as a prisoner to write a book about his family's travels: II Milione (known as The Travels of Marco Polo in English).It was the first book to tell Europeans about China and the East.No original copy survives, but there are several versions of it.Marco's writings influenced many other travelers, most notably Christopher Columbus, who carried a copy of II Milione with him on his voyage in search of Asia. After his release from prison in 1299, Marco rejoined his father and uncle in Venice.The family were now even wealthier than before thanks to the many treasures they'd brought back from the East.Marco financed many more trading journeys but never left the city again.He died in 1324 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice.

What made the author think about the story of about 20 years ago?	I'd like to share a little story with you about something that happened when I was four. I remember it clearly. Our loving family dog was nearing the end of his life. My father picked him up and put him in a little bed we had made for him. Our dog, my companion, whom we had cared for, bit my father when he attempted to help him. How could he? Why? I couldn't understand it. I didn't like him anymore. I hadn't thought about that story for a long time but something that happened last week brought it back to me. I went to speak with a friend. When I knocked on the door, I met in an instant an angry look and a few harsh words. When the door was slammed in my face, I stood there shocked, and in a rush, I was reminded of my dog bit my father 20 years ago or so. What brought that story back was that same feeling of betrayal. Both stories taught me something the next day. You see, when I got up in the morning and was told my dog had died, it became clear to me that he must have been in great pain. For him to have bitten a family member, he could not have been himself. Much the same for the other story when I learned that my friend's wife had just left him. We are all beings of our environments, our opinions and feelings. And all of those things can cause you to say and do things that can't be understood by those who are not in the same situation with you. If you meet someone either behaving out of character or acting in a way that doesn't seem to fit the situation, put out your hand and be patient when you think it is least possible for him to do so. You may turn around a story that has a sad ending simply by your actions.	"[""His friend's attitude.""]"
Considering the best behavior, the tourists ranking second are from _ .	"In a survey of 1,500 European hotel managers, Americans were ranked second, behind the Japanese, as the world's best tourists. In the survey, conducted in April by the online travel site Expedia's German branch, Americans were seen as the most likely to try to speak a foreign language and the most interested in tasting local food. Americans came in third, behind the Japanese and British, as the ""most polite"" tourists, and third, behind the Japanese and Germans, as ""best behaved"". And ---- Americans were ranked far and away as the world's most generous tippers and biggest spenders. On the other hand, Americans were seen as the shabbiest dressers, the most likely to complain and the second noisiest. Who is louder? Only the Italians. Some of the other findings: Russians were as the least polite travelers, followed by the Israelis and French. The stingiest tippers: the Germans, followed by the French and Israelis. Italians, by far, were ranked as the best dressers, followed by the French and Spanish. In terms of bad dressing, the British were a distant second to Americans, followed by the Germans. Who's the most unwilling to try speaking in a foreign language? The French, the British and the Italians, in that order. The Chinese are the most reluctant to taste foreign food, followed closely by ---- this is strange ---- the British, whose home _ is probably the world's most seriously laughed at ( a little unfairly, perhaps). And, finally, the overall award for ""worst tourist in the world"" goes to the French, with the Indians and Chinese."	['Germany']
. What kind of man was the painter?	"A beautiful and very successful actress was the star for a new musical show. Her home was in the countryside, but she did not want to go back there every night, so she bought an expensive house in the centre of the city, got some beautiful furniture and got a man to paint the rooms in new colours. It was very difficult to get tickets for her show, because everybody wanted to see it. So she decided to give the painter two of the best seats. She hoped that this would make him work better for her. He took the tickets without saying anything, and she heard no more about them until the end of the month, when she got the painter's bill . At the bottom of it were these words: "" Four hours watching Miss Hall sing and dance : 3 pounds,"" with this note: "" After 5 p.m. I get 15 shillings an hour instead of 10 shillings."""

Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"There once lived a young man who thought himself to be poor. One day he went to a wise man to ask how to become rich. The wise man said, ""Young man, you are already rich now."" ""But where is my wealth?"" the young man asked. ""It is with you. Your eyes are your wealth. You use them to see this world. You use them to see all the beautiful things in this world. Your hands are your wealth. You can use them to work. You can use them to hug your beloved ones. Your legs are your wealth. You can go to any place..."" the wise man said. ""You call these wealth? But everyone has them,"" the young man said. ""These are wealth. What you have now is not what someone else can luckily have. Would you like to give your eyes to me? I'd like to give you a lot of money to exchange for them,"" the wise man said. ""No, I'm not going to do so! My eyes are important to me!"" the young man said. Everyone is rich. We should treasure our wealth, and take care of it. We should not overuse it because once it is gone, it is gone forever. Remember it is our wealth that we do not want to lose."

The boss told John and Bobby to go to find anyone selling watermelon in the market in order to _ .	"John and Bobby joined a wholesale company together just after graduation from college the same year. Both worked very hard. After several years, however, the boss promoted Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary employee. John couldn't understand it anymore, gave his resignation to the boss and complained that the boss didn't value hardworking workers, but only promoted those who flattered him. The boss knew that John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, ""Thank you for your criticism , but I have a request. I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave. Perhaps you will change your mind and take back your resignation."" John agreed. The boss asked him to go and find out anyone selling watermelon in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found out a man selling watermelon. The boss asked how much per kg? John shook his head and went back to the market to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kg. Boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office. He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelon in the market. Bobby went, returned and said, ""Boss, only one person selling watermelon. $1.2 per kg, and $10 for 10kg. He has 340 melons in all, 58 of which are on the table. Every melon weighs about 2 kg. Bought from the South two days ago, they are fresh and red, good quality."" John was very impressed and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to resign but to learn from Bobby. My dear friends, chances exist in the daily details. For the same matter, a more successful person sees more and farther so that he can find out an opportunity and catch it to realize his aim."	['make John find out the differences between them two.']
What's the author's advice to women who are absorbed in the idea of thinness?	No woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to(...) the late Duchess of Windsor represents much of the strange spirit of our times. Being thin is assumed as such a virtue. The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better --or worse-- part of my life. Being rich wouldn't be bad either, but that won't happen unless an unknown dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars. Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin , and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not unpleasant? All religions have certain days when people stop from eating and overeating is one of Christianity's seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being. Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat -- or even only somewhat overweight -- is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength. Our obsession with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem -- too much fat and a lack of fiber -- than a weight problem. The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much attention to weight. Simply being thin is not enough. It is actually dangerous if those who get (or already are) thin think they are automatically healthy and thus free from paying attention to their overall life-style. Thinness can be pure vain glory.	['They should be more concerned with their overall life style.']
What do we know about California sea lions?	California sea lions are the fastest of all the sea lions, reaching speeds of up to 40 kilometers an hour when swimming. Males are much larger than females, measuring 2 to 2.5 meters and weighing 200 to 453 kilograms. Females only measure 1.5 to 2 meters and weigh 50 to 113 kilograms. They can also move fairly well while on land. California sea lions can be found living along the Pacific coast of North America. They prefer to live in waters near rocky and sandy shores. On land, they often gather in large groups as many as 1,000 of them. While at sea, they travel in much smaller groups of around 10 or more. They communicate with one another through a series of sounds. Their diet consists of a wide variety of fish and other sea animals. They are able to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes by slowing down their heart rate, allowing them to hunt for their prey for a longer period of time. They have been known to continuously hunt for up to 30 hours at a time, with their eyesight and hearing playing an important part in finding their food. Being so large, they do not have that many natural predators that they need to be on the lookout for. Eleven months after getting pregnant, the female will give birth to one baby on land. If the baby can survive long enough, they can live to be 20 to 25 years old. California sea lions are not listed as an endangered species. This is largely because of laws such as the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Hopefully such acts will continue to show results.	['Males are much larger than females.']
The passage is mainly about _ .	"Today, we complete our story about the influential English writer William Shakespeare. He wrote plays and poems during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, which remain very popular today. During earlier times, people would probably have learned several ancient Roman and Greek plays. It was not unusual for writers to produce more current versions of these works. For example, in Shakespeare's play ""The Comedy of Errors""(<<>> )Shakespeare borrowed certain details from the ancient Roman writer Plautus. For his play ""Macbeth""(<<>> ), Shakespeare most likely used a work on Scottish history by Raphael Holinshed for information. Shakespeare might have borrowed from other writers, but the intensity of his imagination and language made the plays his own. While many plays by other writers of his time have been forgotten, Shakespeare and his art live on. Shakespeare was also influenced by the world around him. He described the sights and sounds of London in his plays. His works include observations about political struggles, the fear of diseases, and the popular language of the city's tradesmen. Shakespeare's knowledge of the English countryside is also clear. His works include descriptions of deep forests, local flowers, and the ancient popular traditions of rural people. It would be impossible to list all of the ways in which Shakespeare's works have influenced the world culture. But the first and greatest example would be his great influence on the English language. During his time, the English language was changing. Many new words from other languages were being added. Shakespeare used his sharp mind and poetic inventiveness to create hundreds of new words and rework old ones. For example, he created the noun forms of ""critic"", ""mountaineer"" and ""eyeball"". Many common expressions in English come from his plays, including ""pomp and circumstance ""from ""Othello""(<<>> ), ""full circle "" from ""King Lear""(<<>> ), etc. The list of cultural creations influenced by Shakespeare is almost endless. From paintings to television to music and dance, Shakespeare was well represented. Shakespeare's plays have been translated into every major language in the world. Shakespeare became a well-known writer during a golden age of theater. His years of hard work paid off."	['how culture influenced Shakespeare and he influenced culture.']
Schoolboys and schoolgirls first pick up little bad habits _ .	Bad Hobbies It's easier to walk downhill than to climb uphill. So it is easier to fall into bad habits than into good ones. Bad habits do not form suddenly. They form little by little, so you don't realize their danger. Schoolboys and schoolgirls first pick up little bad habits at school or on the streets. When they cannot do their homework, they copy from their classmates. If they see bigger boys or girls smoking, they also want to learn to smoke. If they see their friends gambling ,they want to gamble. When they get older, the habits become stronger and stronger. Then they can no longer give them up. From copying, they learn to steal; from gambling, they learn to cheat. At last, no one believes in them. It is very important to stop bad habits as soon as they begin! My son is eight years old. He is now in Grade Three. When he was five, he started school. Every evening we have homework battles. Three afternoons a week he has activities after school. By the time we get home, homework is the last thing he feels like doing. The other two afternoon, he gets home early and we argue about whether he should do his homework straight away, or if he should have some time to rest and play first. When my son finally sits down to do his homework, he seems to want me there helping him all the time. I do want to help him, but I am sure that he can do it by himself. In fact, I often end up telling him the answers to most of his homework. He has fallen into the habit of depending on me to do this. He never wants to use his own brain. My wife and I have given up all our outdoor activities. We sit with him when he does his homework. We want to train him form some good learning habits. But what should we do?

From the passage, we can know _ .	Many textbooks are not written in the kind of English that we speak every day. In fact, sometimes the reading is so difficult that it almost seems like a foreign language. In a way, it is--the language of science. You should not expect to be able to read a difficult science passage the same way you read an interesting story; you should not expect to read it easily and all at once. Instead, you may have to read it several times through, catching on the meaning of difficult words, going back over difficult sentences, and finally putting the whole thing together. Do not be discourages if the whole passage don't make sense to you at first. You need to pick it apart patiently until you can understand it. These are the steps to follow when you are reading something difficult: 1. Start to read normally until you _ a sentence that doesn't make sense to you. 2. When a sentence doesn't make sense, go back and read it again more slowly. 3. Look for any word you don't know in the sentence. Try to understand their meanings using word parts and context clues . If necessary, look them up in the dictionary. 4. Look at the next few sentences to see if they explain more about the sentence you are working on. Do not read very much farther ahead until you understand what is being said. 5. Finally, read the sentence again. Try to put it into simpler words. 6. Read through the passage once. Try to understand all the hard parts well. Then read the whole passage once more at a usual speed. This helps you to put all ides together. The stops sound a lot harder than they are. It is really just the normal way good readers understand anything that is difficult to read. After you have done the best you can this way, you should always feel free to ask for help from your teacher, if you have one.	['it is sometimes difficult to read a science passage']
The accident happened usually because _ .	China's long-awaited rules on school bus safety finally came into force on Tuesday, including a list of ways aimed at reducing the risk of accident. Among the biggest changes is that buses carrying students will be given priority in traffic, while companies and drivers will need licenses to offer school transport services. Officials have spent more than four months making the rules, during which time the country has been shocked by several big crashes because of overcrowded school buses. The latest accident happened on Monday in Yangchun, Guangdong province, in which three kindergarten pupils were killed and 14 others injured. Rules and funding In the new rules, a school bus is considered as a vehicle with more than seven seats that is transporting children receiving the State's nine-year compulsory education (ages 6 to 15) to or from school. This can also be for preschoolers if a parent is unable to take them to or from kindergarten . School buses must also operate in routes marked in the map by governments to ensure safety. Punishment Companies and bus drivers who fail to meet the rules face the punishment. Drivers against the rules will be fined 200 yuan ($32) and vehicles will be taken away from its owner if they have been used as an unlicensed school bus.

"The part of ""Only you can make a card like this one"" is to tell the readers _ ."	"Whether you will be a doctor or a police officer in the future, there's a teacher in your life. They teach you and help you know who you are? Of course, you want to thank them. Teachers' Day is the perfect chance for students around the world to thank their teachers. The festival falls on different days in different countries. In China, Teachers' Day is on September 10. But in the US, teachers have a whole week to celebrate. Teacher Appreciation Week is in the first full week of May every year. Kids used to bring apples for their teachers because apples are healthy. Now, they bring gifts with pictures of apples, such as cups, picture frames and teddy bears. Some students also make DIY gifts for their teachers. During the week, school clubs often offer teachers a free breakfast of coffee and pastries. The South Korean Teachers' Day is on May 15. Many students offer flowers to their teachers. Another traditional gift is a card. Thousands of students prepare personalized cards and give them to their favorite teachers. Although different countries have different Teachers' Days, there's one day for the whole world to honor teachers. On October 5 of every year, over 100 countries, such as Canada and the Philippines, express their thanks by celebrating World Teachers' Day. UNESCO started the day in 1994.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Some people love going to museums,while others absolutely hate it and would rather stay at home,enjoying their favorite TV shows.Increasingly,museums are being seen as outdated and boring by today's youngsters. I have just returned to the UK after travelling around the USA.While there,I visited lots of museums I must say,museums are typically educational, either to develop knowledge gained at school in particular subjects,or to enhance knowledge of other cultures In Chicago,we visited the world-famous Art Institute of Chicago.It was filled with paintings,drawings and sculptures by a huge variety of artists,such as Picasso,Monet,Matisse and Dali.There was a mixture of traditional and modern art,including colorful stained glass windows and abstract art. When we were in Washington D.C.,we visited a few of the Smithsonian museums. These are all free to visit-which is great if you just want to see a few things,and not spend all day inside.The Air and Space Museum was particularly good:it had lots of aircrafts and rockets on display,interesting information and also some interactive parts.We also went to the National U. S. Holocaust )Memorial Museum. Naturally,it was sad to read about the horrors of this tragedy which affected so many people in World War II .However,it was also incredibly interesting to read the stories of those who survived the Holocaust,as well as those who helped others. Last but not least,I also found the 9/11 Memorial and Museum to be of great interest. This museum is dedicated to those who lost their lives,as well as their families,when the Twin Towers in New York City were attacked by terrorists in 2001 .It tells you how the terrorists planned the attack,how they hijacked the planes,and ultimately what happened as a result of their actions.Surviving pieces of the towers are shown in the museum,alongside damaged fire engines. It was a truly thought-provoking visit,which made me value my own life that little bit more. I think museums play an important role in preserving artifacts of historical importance for future generations.Whatever your interests,there is likely to be a museum for you. You can visit waxwork museums to see models of your favorite celebrities(and get photos with the Queen!),science museums for a more hands-on,interactive visit and so much more!Best of all,if you're ever in the UK,many of them are free!

Which of the following is TRUE about the public bookshelves?	"Public bookshelves are appearing across Germany on street corners,city squares and in suburban supermarkets. In these freeforall libraries,people can grab whatever they want to read,and leave behind anything they want for others. There's no need to register,no due date,and you can take or give as many as you want.""This project is aimed at everyone who likes to read .It is open for everybody,"" Michael Aubermann,one of the organizers of the free book exchange said. The western city' s latest public shelf was put up next to Bayenturm. It is the fourth free shelf that Aubermann' s group,the Cologne Citizen's Foundation,has placed outside.""We set up our other outdoor shelves last year and it's been working really well,"" said Aubermann. The public bookshelves,which are usually financed by donations and cared for by local volunteer groups,have appeared independently of each other in many cities,suburbs and villages. Each shelf holds around 200 books and it takes about six weeks for a complete turnover,with all the old titles replaced by new ones. Even commercial book stores and online book sellers seem to support the idea of free book exchanges.""We see this project rather as a sales promotion than as competition,""said Elmar Muether.""If books are present everywhere,it helps our business,too."" So far,the Cologne book group has had few problems with damage or other problems. Aubermann said,""Propaganda is the only kind of literature we do not allow here."" At another bookshelf in the Bayenthal neighborhood,the lower shelves are reserved for children's literature only.""It is important that we make it easy for everyone to participate in this 'reading culture on the street'--from old readers to kids to immigrants,""Aubermann said. While most of the shelves have so far been put up in _ ,Aubermann and the 20 volunteers who help look after the project are planning to put up future shelves in poor neighborhoods,where citizens often don't have as much access to literature."

The Information Highway _ .	Passage 1 The Information Highway is the road that links computer users to a large number of on-line services: the Web,e-mail,and software,to mention just a few. Not long ago,the Information Highway was a new road,with not many users. Now,everyone seems to want to take a drive, with over 30 million families connected worldwide. Not surprisingly, this well-traveled highway is starting to look like a well-traveled highway. Traffic jams can cause many serious problems,forcing the system to close down for repair. Naturally,accidents will happen on such a crowded road,and usually victims are some files,gone forever. Then,of course,there' s Mr. Cool,with his new broad-band connection,who speeds down the highway faster than most of us can go. But don' t trick yourself:he pays for that speeding. Passage 2 Want to know more about global warming and how you can help prevent it?Doctor Herman Friedman,who is considered a leading expert on the subject,will speak at Grayson Hall next Friday. Friedman studied environmental science at three well-known universities around the world before becoming a professor in the subject. He has also traveled around the world observing environmental concerns. The gradual bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef,which came into the public eye in 2002,is his latest interest. Signed copies of his color1ful book,which was p ublished just last month,will be on sale after his talk.	['appeals to a large number of users']
It can be concluded from the text that _ .	"Pulling heavy suitcases all day in the summer is hard work, especially when you're a thin 14-year-old.That was me in 1940-the youngest and smallest baggage boy at New York City's Pennsyl-vania Railway Station. After just a few days on the job, I began noticing that the other fellows were overcharging passengers. I'd like to join them, thinking, ""Everyone else is doing it."" When I got home that night, I told my dad what I wanted to do."" You give an honest day's work,"" he said, looking at me straight in the eye."" They're paying you. If they want to do that, you let them do that."" I followed my dad's advice for the rest of that summer and have lived by his words ever since. Of all the jobs I've had, it was my experience at Pennsylvania Railway Station that has stuck with me. Now I teach my players to have respect for other people and their possessions. Being a member of a team is a totally shared experience. If one person steals, it destroys trust and hurts everyone. I can put up with many things, but not with people who steal. If one of my players were caught stealing, he'd be gone. Whether you're on a sports team, in an office or a member of a family, if you can't trust one another, there's going to be trouble."	['his experience as a baggage boy had a great influence on his later life']
What has decided the different shopping habits of men and women?	"The reason why women love to spend hours in shops while men prefer to be in and out of the high street in minutes can trace back to their hunter-gathering past, find scientists. While women spent their days gathering food, often with children, men were hunters who made plans about how to catch and kill their prey . These two ways of getting food in the past show how we shop in modern times, the study believes. Women would spend hours trying to find the right things, because they had in the past spent ages trying to find the best quality and health-giving food. Men, on the other hand, decided in advance what animal they wanted to kill and then went looking for it. Once it was found and killed, they returned home. Daniel Kruger, professor of the University of Michigan, said the study could be the answer to why there are a lot of _ when couples go shopping together. He said it could also help couples to avoid fights in the shops if they understood the reasons why each sex had different ways of deciding on the perfect present. ""In modern times, women are much more likely than men to know when a specific type of item will go on sale. Women also spend much more time choosing the perfect color and texture."" Professor Kruger said his study was important because if men and women understood each other's shopping habits they could avoid arguments while shopping."

They also tell you what to say to an interviewer on the telephone. Some websites give you interview conversations to practice. One website even has a dictionary of interview words. A good employment website can be a big help in your job search. Good luck with your job-hunting."	['on the telephone']
According to the passage, a Get Rich Quick type of publication _ .	"A week ago, I had the great pleasure of reading an e-book, By Rich Ezzo.It took only about an hour to read. When I first received a copy, I thought it was a Get Rich Quick type of publication.Nothing is wrong with Get Rich Quick, but my mind just doesn't chase after dreams of wealth.I think that if God ever wants me to be rich, he knows where to find my purse. When I began reading I was overjoyed to find that Rich Ezzo isn't money hungry either.He, too, is hungry far more important than money. Since I love this e-book so much, why wait a week to write the review? Simple.I wanted to see if the effect it had on me was a keeper.After reading the last word of the e-book, I totally agreed with the subtitle which promised to forever change the way we thought about money.I had so many thoughts running around my mind that I had to install a stoplight to stop some while others made their way into the picture, then I yielded them as a few ones arrived in town. . It has been a week and the effect is the same.I truly do look at money differently and have even done a few things differently this week.This is an e-book you'll want to read, I promise.I often recommend books to my daughter, and this is one that I didn't just ""suggest""---I left it open at the bottom of the computer and told each one, ""Read it, you'll love it.""

For whom is the passage mainly written?	"Music probably isn't the main reason for where you choose to eat something, but restaurant owners put a lot of thought into what they play. In a recent article about music's role in restaurant design, author Mark Brandau details the different ways sound influences sales. Here are a few ""notes"" to keep in mind the next time you need to pick a restaurant: It's someone's job to design playlists. Restaurant owners hire experts to build music playlists for different times of the day. A restaurant owner says, ""Lively songs encourage quick dining and faster table turns at meal time."" What you hear at lunch won't be what you hear at dinner. And what you hear after dinner will be something totally different. If a restaurant wants to increase late-night sales, music is very important to creating the right atmosphere. Music builds brands . Nick Vojnovic, president of Little Greek, had been in the business for 20 years. He began to realize how important music is to the restaurant experience after listening to a manager from The Cheesecake Factory speak about using music to develop brand identity. Where have you heard that before? Restaurants may be using the same music providers. Ambiance Radio provides playlists for Little Greek in Florida, and also Schlotzsky's and Union Square Cafe in New York City. Vojnovic, who started his business at Chili's, pointed out that years ago, background music was changed only once per quarter. Music helps restaurants choose diners. Brandau explains that some restaurants would like to turn up the music, not to bother certain groups of customers, but to stay true to their main diners. If college kids are a restaurant's main diners, the restaurant will surely play music that makes older people feel uninvited."	['People who eat in restaurants.']

From the passage we can infer that guessing is _ in learning a foreign language.	"One of the things to be learnt in a foreign language is guessing all the time what kind of thing to come when listening to someone talking.

How many hours of sleep should 9-year-old children have every night?	During the day we work and play,and at night we sleep. Our body rests when we sleep. In the morning we are ready to work and play again. Our body grows most when we are asleep. Children who are tired usually need sleep. We can get better at our lessons after having plenty of rest. Boys and girls who are eight or nine years old need ten hours of sleep every night. Our body needs plenty of air when we are asleep. If we do not get enough fresh air, we will feel tired when we wake up. While in bed we must not cover our head,our lungs need to get enough fresh air. If we open our windows at night,we can have plenty of fresh air. Cool air is better than warm air.	['10 hours.']
Which of the following is TURE about the tests on the crows?	"PEOPLE may use the expression ""birdbrain"" in English to talk about someone who is stupid, but crows prove that this is unfair. Now it has been discovered that crows may understand analogies . To test this ability in animals, scientists do ""relational matching-to-sample (RMTS)""tests. If a pair was AA, for example, then picking BB to match it would be correct. An international team led by Edward Wasserman in the US first trained two crows to match things by color1, shape, and number in what is called"" identity matching-to-sample (IMTS)"" , then moved onto RMTS. For the IMTS test, the birds were put in a cage with a plastic tray that had three cards and two cups in it. The card in the middle was the sample card. The cups on either side were covered with the other two cards. One was the same as the sample, while the other wasn' t. The cup with the card that matched the sample card contained two worms to eat. In the second part of the experiment, the birds were tested with relational matching pairs. A card with two same- sized circles, for example, meant they should pick the test card with two same-sized squares and not two different-sized circles. The birds did well in the more difficult test and picked the correct card more than three quarters of the time. Wasserman was surprised that crows were able to solve the problem without any training in RMTS. He said in a news release: ""Honestly, if it was only by force that the crows showed this learning, then it would have been an impressive result. But this was spontaneous."" So perhaps it' s time to stop saying "" birdbrain"" permanently."	['In the IMTS test, the birds needed to identify the sample card to get rewards.']
The text probably comes from a book about _ .	"Renaissance is a French word. It means ""rebirth"". It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly "" reborn"" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist. People wanted to find out more about the world by studying it. This attitude of investigation had been common in classical scholars, and it was 'reborn' during the Renaissance."	['history']

The friendly feelings between two countries are strengthened because _ .	In ancient Greece,there were four major athletic meetings and the Olympian meeting played the most important part in the lives of the people. As time passed,the Olympian meeting gradually lost its local character and became first a national event and then international. No one knows exactly how far back the Olympic Games go but some official records date from 776 BC. The Games took place every four years on the plain by Mount Olympus. Thousands of people came from all parts of the Greek world to watch the games. The winner of the foot race had the great honor of giving his name to the year of his history. After a long history of almost 1,200 years,the Games were stopped for religious reasons. It was then decided in 1896 to start the Olympic Games again. The meeting was held in Athens and 311 athletes from 13 countries took part in it but the idea of such an international meeting attracted the world's attention. After the 1908 London Olympics,many nations sent their best athletes. Although the Games have been time and again threatened by some unfavorable political events, the Games have taken place every four years. Nowadays, the Games are held in different countries in turn. As the biggest international gathering of any kind in the world,athletes from different countries play games together and this provides them with good chances to learn to live together. The friendly feelings in the Olympic Village make people think of the world as one big family. The Olympic Games will be hosted in Beijing in 2008. It is believed that the Games will be a wonder of the world.	['they enable people to know each other better']

When did mum change her habits?	"After the Spring Festival, I found some of my mom's daily habits have changed. Her cooking way was different. Vegetables that had been cooked crisply became very tender and soft. Fish that had been fried became soup. Her old shredded potato turned into diced potato... Feeling strange, dad and I asked Mom the reason for the change. But all she said was, ""Just trying a different taste"". Then she was silent. But it wasn't just her cooking way. Mom also change other habits. After dinner, instead of watching films on TV as usual, she would put on her newly-bought sports clothes and asked Dad to go out for a walk. After they came back home, mom would lose herself in magazines or newspapers about healthcare. Mom almost never gets sick. Why was she suddenly interested in medicine? I couldn't understand her ""abnormal"" behavior. Then one day I came across her micro blog . ""While visiting my parents during the Spring Festival, I suddenly realized that they are in their 70s now,"" my mom had written. ""They move slowly and it is hard for them to do the housework. I should visit them more often... ""Some cooking should be changed to keep them healthy. They like fish soup, diced potato, tender and soft vegetables... ""I must also keep fit by doing physical exercise. If my parents are too weak to move around, I can be strong enough to take care of them. When I am old, my son can also pay less attention to taking care of me..."" When I read this, I felt very sorry. I used to complain that Mom didn't understand me and couldn't give me everything I wanted. I always thought there was a wide gap between us. But now I completely understand her. How great she is! She always thinks of others before herself. Everything she does is to help the people she loves live better lives. How unselfish her love is!"	['After the Spring Festival.']
The author argues that a teacher's chief concern should be the development of the pupil's _ .	We find that bright children are rarely held back by mix-ability teaching. On the contrary, both their knowledge and experience are enriched. We feel that there are many disadvantages in streaming pupils. It does not take into account the fact that children develop at different rates. It can have a bad effect on both the bright and the not-so-bright child. After all, it can be quite discouraging to be at the bottom of the top grade! Besides, it is rather unusual to grade pupils just according to their intellectual ability. This is only one aspect of their total personality. We are concerned to develop the abilities of all our pupils to the full, not just their learning ability. We also value personal qualities and social skills, and we find that mixed ability teaching contributes to all these aspects of learning. In our classrooms, we work in various ways. The pupils often work in groups: this gives them the opportunity to learn to co-operate, to share, and to develop leadership skills. They also learn how to deal with personal problems as well as learning how to think, to make decisions, to analyze and assess, and to communicate effectively. The pupils learn from each other as well as from the teacher. Sometimes the pupils work in pairs; sometimes they work on individual tasks and assignments, and they can do this at their own speed. They also have some formal class teaching when this is proper. We encourage our pupils to use the library, and we teach them the skills they need in order to do this efficiently. And advanced pupil can do advanced work. It doesn't matter what age the child is. We expect our pupils to do their best, not their least, and we give them every encouragement to achieve this goal.

What did Lisa know about her father? She knew her father's _ .	"Lisa never had the chance to know her father. He and her mother divorced when she was just a young child. Even though he didn't move far, he never came to visit his children. Lisa often wondered about her father. What did he look like and what was he doing? All she knew was his name: Jeff White. After Lisa grew up, she became a nurse at a hospital, where she would help provide medicine and comfort for patients in their final days. A few weeks ago, she received a new patient whose name was Jeff White. When Jeff came into his room, Lisa asked him if he had any children. Jeff told her that he had two daughters, Lisa and Elly. Lisa couldn't hold her tears back. She told him, ""I am Lisa, your daughter."" Jeff embraced her, saying that he was not a good father. And the daughter held his hand and kissed him. Then Jeff began to sing This Magic Moment. Jeff could have just weeks left to live, so Lisa wanted to make the most of the time she had with him. Lisa also brought her kid to the hospital to meet their grandfather. The kid made cards for him with the words, ""I love you."""	['name']
The average number of hours of sleep that an adult needs is _ .	After a day of work and play, the body needs to rest. Sleep is necessary for good health. During this time, the body recovers from the activities of the previous day. The rest that you get while sleeping enables your body to prepare itself for the next day. There are four levels of sleep, each being a little deeper than the one before. As you sleep, your muscles relax little by little. Your heart beats more slowly, and your brain slows down. After you reach the fourth level, your body shifts back and forth from one level of sleep to the other. Although your mind slows down, from time to time you will dream. Scientists who study sleep state that when dreaming occurs your eyeballs begin to move quickly (although your eyelids are closed). This stage of sleep is called REM, which stands for rapid eye movement. If you have trouble falling asleep, some people recommend breathing very slowly and very deeply. Other people believe that drinking warm milk will help make you drowsy. There is also an old suggestion that counting sheep will put you to sleep.	['not stated here.']

There are altogether 1,200 students in the school. Usually only 20 students break the school dress rule every day. So the headmaster Theresa Mayerik said it was the worst new term she had ever seen. At Morton High School, students' favorite clothes such as wide pants and low-necked shirts are not allowed( ).

What is the main idea of the passage?	"""It hurts me more than you,''and ""This is for your own good.''These are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin,clean my room,stay home and do homework. That was before we entered the permissive period in educafion in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school.The schools and the educators made it easy on us.They thought that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators,turned on the television,left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers,faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years,are realizing we've made a terrible mistake.One such teacher is Sharon Klompus who says of her students-""so passive""-and-wonders what happened.Nothing was demanded of them,she believes. Television,says Klompus,contributes to children's passivity.""We're not training kids to work any more,"" says Klompus.""we're talking about a generation of kids who've never been hurt or hungry.They have learned somebody will always do it for them. Instead of saying 'go look it up',you tell them the answer.It takes greater energy to say no to a kid."" Yes,it does.It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work.It's time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it's for their own good.It's time to start telling them no again."

From the text we can infer that .	"It was a Black Day for love in South Korea on Monday with lonely hearts trying to ease their pain by diving head first into bowls of noodles. South Korea celebrates Valentine ' s Day, where local custom dictates women give gifts to men. It has taken on a popular event born in Japan but sweeping Asia known as White Day on March 14 when men return the favor with gifts for women. But Black Day, on April 14, is a South Korean original. It is marked by people who have not found love dressing in dark color1s and commiserating over meals of black food, with the dish of choice being Chinese-style noodles topped with a thick sauce of black bean paste. ""I had a miserable time on Valentine ' s Day, felt even lonelier on White Day and now I' m crying over a bowl of' black noodles,"" said a young woman, ""Things better be different next year. At universities across the country on Monday, students without lunch dates ordered black noodles, dined with other lonely hearts and searched for companionship, South Korea marketers have used special days for the 14th of each month to create a calendar full of love. Some days have gained attraction such as Black Day, while others such as Green Day in August, when couples are supposed to drink cheap wine that comes in green bottles and walk in the woods, have yet to attract much of a following. Black Day events have snowballed, with a major matchmaking service this year providing an evening of speed dating where the dish of choice is sushi blackened by squid ink. An on-line company for movie tickets sponsored a speed eating competition of black noodles for those who bought single tickets for the latest films.

At the time of its fall, the Bastille housed _ .	Why was Bastille important to the citizens of Paris? The building of the Bastille had been started in 1370 under Charles V. By the seventeenth century, it had stopped to be important for defense. Cardinal Richelieu turned it into a prison. It was not an ordinary prison to punish common crimes. Its huge doors closed only on enemies of the King. The Bastille's workings were secret. Prisoners were taken to it in closed vehicles. Soldiers on guard duty had to stand with their faces to the wall. No talking was allowed. Worst of all, a prisoner never knew if he would be there a day, a week, a year, or forever. Only the King's letter could set him free. Over the years, the number of arrests by King's letter had become fewer. By the time of its fall, most of the prisoners were writers who had written against the corruptions of the government. Voltaire, the famous French writer, spent a year there in 1717-1718, and another 12 days in 1726. For those who believed in free speech and free thinking, the Bastille stood for everything evil. The day it was captured, only seven prisoners were found inside. Still, the Bastille was hated by the people. It was a symbol of the King's complete power.	['only a few prisoners']
Why did the author say the southern states was the fire home?	Of all nature's disasters, forest fires are often considered the most frightening. Moving at lightning speed, huge walls of flames can burn acres of land in just a few minutes. And although technology, including the use of tire-retardant chemicals, has greatly helped the fight against forest fires, they still take great damage. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the fire season last year was the worst on record in terms of the number of fires and acres burned. There were 96.385 fires and9,873429 acres affected by fire in a year that was 125% more destructive than the 10-year average . These fires cost the federal govemment $1.5 billion to fight, and this figure does not include the money spent by local and state govemments as part of the effort. Fires in the southern states represented half of the national total last year. with Texas. Oklahoma and Arkansas being home to an usually high amount of activity. Wildfire have also taken place in Western states such as California, Colorado. and Alaska throughout the past 10 years. It is said that two-thirds of forest fires are started accidentally by people. almost one quarter are purposely set, while lighting causes 10%. Forest fires can have advantageous effects. Charcoal enriches soil, and some plant species grow well after. The cones of the jack pine tree, for example, will not spread their seeds unless there is heat. Douglas fir trees grow best in open sunlight areas after fire.	['Fifty percent of the national total fire happened there']
It can be inferred from the passage that_.	"Every Christmas the giant tree inprefix = st1 /RockefellerCentersparkles with thousands of lights. From the beginning, when construction workers raised the first one during the depths of the Depression, it has been a symbol of hope. Diana Abad, like most Americans, loved that tree. In 1999, however, Diana was writing her will. The 33-year-old woman from Staten Island, New York, was diagnosed with leukemia and wanted to put her things in order. Doctors told her she had nine months to live. Her slim chance for survival lay in finding a bone marrow donor. The most likely source for a match is always among s -- but her family was tested and there was none. Then one day in February 2000, she got a call from the hospital saying that out of the four million people _ in the National Marrow Donor Program Registry, there was only one match. The potential donor was thinking about it. In March the donor agreed, and the transplant procedure was scheduled for March 27. On that day, a doctor came in with the marrow in a bag, and Diana remembers him saying:""This is it. If it doesn't graft within four to six hours, nothing will bring you back."" Diana asked a priest to give her last rite . Almost immediately after the two-hour procedure, she felt stronger. Doctors told her it looked like the graft had taken. Donors are anonymous, but when she was better, Diana sent a note through the Registry: ""You don't know the joy that I am experiencing,"" she wrote. ""I hope that one day we can meet and I can thank you in person."" It was several months before the donor replied. At first he didn't even give his name. He was 34-year-old David Mason, and he lived inDedham,Massachusetts. But eventually the two exchanged phone numbers and began to talk. Then unexpectedly and unannounced, he turned up at her door inEnglishtown,New Jersey, on December 23. She says it was love at first sight. He says he didn't feel it until they met the second time. That meeting began a long-distance romance that culminated under the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center in December 2004. That's where David proposed to Diana. She, of course, said yes."

Why does Yao Ming win more popularity than Wang Zhizhi at home?	"""Some day, there'll be no Americans left in the NBA,"" said 12-year-old Xing Tao, who joined his school team two weeks ago after watching Yao Ming in a televised NBA game, ""The players will all be Chinese, like Yao."" To China, Yao is a home-grown superstar who helped make the world's first basketball league closer to Chinese players. To the NBA, the 2.23-meter center offers an opening of a different sort into the world's largest new market. Yao's NBA first appearance against the Indiana Pacers in October reached 287 million families in the US. That game might have been a bit of a _ to Yao's fans: He played just 11 of the 48 minutes, had two rebounds and got no points. Comparing that with his performance on December 19, also against Indiana, Yao won 29 points and 10 rebounds. ""This was one of the most exciting games I've had,"" Yao said after Houston's 95-83 victory. The NBA has to be excited about his on-count success. In all his games, he's averaging 12.7 points and 7.7 rebounds, quite good for a new star. ""Yao Ming has brought the NBA closer to the Chinese,"" said NBA spokeswoman Cheong Sau Ching, ""That makes the dream seem practical for other people in China and proud to be Chinese."" The 22-year-old Yao is not the country's first player in the NBA: Wang Zhizhi broke down the Dallas Mavericks in November 2003. But Yao's combination of modesty and skills make him a favorite back home."	['He is modest and performs excellently.']
The main purpose of the passage is _ .	Planning a visit to the UK? Here we help with ways to cut your costs. AVOID BIG EVENTS Big sporting events, concerts and exhibitions can increase the cost of accommodation and make it harder to find a room. A standard double room at the Thistle Brighton on the final Friday of the Brighton Comedy Festival(19 Oct.) cost PS169. 15 at Booking.com. A week later, the same room costPS 118.15 If you can be flexible and want to know dates to avoid--or you're looking for a big event to pass your time--check out sites such as Whatsonwhen.com, which allow you to search for events in the UK by city, date and category. STAYAWAY FROM THE STATIONIf traveling to your destination by train, you may want to find a good base close to the station, but you could end up paying more for the sake of convenience at the start of your holiday. Don't be too choosy about the part of town you stay in. Booking two months in advance, the cheapest room at Travelodge's Central Euston hotel inLondonfor Saturday 22 September was PS95.95. A room just a tube journey away at itsCovent Gardenhotel was PS75.75. And at Farringdon, a double room cost just PS62.95. LOOK AFTER YOURSELFReally central hotels in cities such asLondon,EdinburghandCardiffcan cost a fortune, especially at weekends and during big events. As an alternative consider checking into a self-catering flat with its own kitchen. Often these flats are hidden away on the top floors of city centre buildings. A great example is the historic O'Neill Flat onEdinburgh's Royal Mile, available for PS420 for five days in late September, with room for four adults. GET ON A BIKELondon's 'Boris bikes' have attracted the most attention, but other cities also have similar programmes that let you rent a bicycle and explore at your own pace, saving you on public transport or car parking costs.

You don't have to sing songs aloud if you are shy, but after learning a song you should be able to follow the words without looking at the lyrics. When you can do that, you have learned something that you will never forget! Some good songs to listen to are from the Beatles, John Denver and the Carpenters. Their songs are not too fast and the lyrics are close to normal spoken English. Just for fun, you can try Mr. Joe's favorite singer, B.B. King. His songs are not easy at all! If you can understand even 80% of ""Why I Sing the Blues"", you are a very _ student. If you become good at singing English songs, you can try to go to karaoke and sing with your friends. When you are able to sing a song in another language, even if you don't sing so beautifully, you will really impress(......) other people!"	['the lyrics are close to normal spoken English']

What is the purpose of this text?	"Over the years, many cities and states have tried to put a tax on sugary drinks. Last week, Berkeley, California succeeded. The city in northern California will charge a penny-per-ounce tax on most sugary drinks. The tax is expected to raise more than $1 million every year to fight against obesity . Makers of sugary drinks are against the tax. They say picking out one product will not solve the obesity problem in America. They also argue that a tax is an attack on personal freedom. ""Families should be able to make the choice for their kids without the government stepping in,"" said Chris Gindlesperger, a spokesperson for the American Beverage Association . Gindlesperger says that the fight against obesity is more successful when the government partners with industry. He shows how the beverage industry worked with President Bill Clinton's administration is the 1990s. They introduced water, milk, and fruit juice into a large number of schools, which took the place of sugary drinks. More recently, the beverage industry listened to First Lady Michelle Obama's suggestion that labels on sugary drinks be clearer. Containers of up to 20 ounces will show the total calories on the front. Some people say a tax is a _ way to help reduce obesity in the U.S. ""There is clear evidence that taxes result in less consumption of sugary drinks,"" says Dr. Rachel Johnson, a spokesperson for the American Heart Association. She points to Mexico as an example. The country put up a tax on sugary drinks in January, and sales have already dropped by 10%. What's more, sales of healthier drinks have increased. Bottled water sales are up by 13%. Milk sales are up by 7%. Another purpose of the tax is to raise money to fight childhood obesity. Money will be used to build playgrounds, create educational materials, and increase the sales of the healthier foods. ""We've already helped reduce obesity to some degree,"" says Dr. Johnson. ""I'm confident that we're going to see even bigger progress soon."""	['To discuss if sugary drinks should be taxed.']
Where can the passage be seen?	"BUKHANNON, West Virginia--Two rescue teams slowly moved along a two-mile path on Monday night to the site of a coal mine explosion that trapped 13 miners, who had not been heard from since the early morning accident. Meanwhile, at a nearby church, more than 250 family members and friends gathered, waiting for updates on the rescuers' progress. The miners were trapped at about 6:30 and many families weren't informed of the accident until about 10 a.m-more than three hours after it happened.""It's very upsetting, but you've got to be patient, I guess,"" said John Helms, whose brother, Terry, was trapped in the mine. The trapped miners were about 260 feet underground and about 10,000 feet from the Sago Mine's entrance, said Roger Nicholson, general counsel from International Coal Group. At a late night news conference, Nicholson said one team had advanced about 4, 800 feet in the four hours since entering the mine just before 6 p.m.Another team entered the mine about 30 minutes later. He said the crew was very experienced, with some members having worked underground for 30 to 35 years.The miners were equipped with about one hour of breathable oxygen each.The company has not released the names of the miners. The teams test the air about every 500 feet, and have to disconnect (remove) the power to the phones they use to communicate with the surface before doing that."" We don't want to be energizing anything if it's in an atmosphere with burnable gases,"" Kips said. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.High levels of carbon monoxide were discovered shortly after the explosion, which delayed rescue efforts, but those levels have since subsided , authorities said."

Each year, hundreds of toy companies from across the country come together in New York City. All kinds of products are shown as a way to know what's to come in the new year. This year's trends include oversize toys. ""In 2014, everything is really big and really out there,"" says Adrienne Appell, a toy-trends expert. Toy Fair is the largest toy trade show in the Western Hemisphere . Toy-store buyers go to the event to decide which toys they may want to sell during the holiday season. Members of the media, like TFK, go to the fair to report back on all the cool trends. Unfortunately, Toy Fair is not open to the public. This year's Toy Fair was the biggest in its 111-year history. More than 1,000 toy companies showed products from simple card games to high-tech robots. ""Larger Than Life"" was a Toy Fair favorite. This trend is all about big toys with a big play value.

Yang began learning Spanish in 1959 at age 48, and started to translate Don Quixote in 1962. She was the first to translate Don Quixote into Chinese. The work was stopped twice due to the ""cultural revolution"". She completed it in 1976, and the Chinese edition was published in 1978 and has sold more than 1 million copies. In that year, the Spanish king and queen visited China, and then-leader Deng Xiao-ping gave the royal couple Yang's translation as a gift. Yang was received by Deng at the Great Hall of the People. While shaking hands, Deng asked her when she had completed the translation. ""It's just published,"" she replied, having no time to tell the full story.

According to the passage, eating green will _ .	If you really want to go green, here's good news: eating green is good for you. The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems. Focus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves.

Why does Johnny Barnes smile and wave at every passer-by?	He has breakfast at 2 a.m.because Johnny Barnes, Mr.Happy Man, has work to do.From 4 to 10 a.m.,he greets commuters as they drive by on their way to work.

In the Matt Morris's short documentary, he says: I'm just little Johnny Barnes.I'm just a little , small instrument in the hand of God be used any way he feels fit.What I do every day , 2:00 in the morning I'm getting my break fast.You're still sleeping [he tells the interviewer] , I guess. From 20 to four until ten I stand on the corner and just greet people, let them know that life is sweet and beautiful. No matter what happens in life, it's always sweet to be alive. No matter what the weather is like , he is there from Monday to Friday , spreading love. On the rare occasion he is not there , people call the radio station to see if he is OK.. He was 88 when the film was posted in 2012.Every day he was spreading love, straight from his generous heart. So well known and beloved is Barnes that the city of Hamilton built up a statue in his honour.The figure wears the same full beard and straw hat that are Barnes's trademarks.So even when the day comes for the real Johnny Barnes to pass from this life, his smile and his memory will still be at that corner, spreading love to every passer--by.

What is the best title for the passage?	For many years scientists have said that the earth is getting warmer. Now they have found something new-hot cities! In the southern US, they have found that cities become very hot in summer. For example, the city of Atlanta in Georgia has roof temperature of up to 50oC while it is 27degC in the streets! At night, the outside of buildings stays so hot that the heat of the city causes storms over the city! China also has the same kind of problems. Every year more farmland is used for factories or offices. More housing is needed, too. As people become richer, they buy more cars. New roads are needed and new car parks are built in the city centers. This all makes cities hotter. It isn't easy to change the situation. City planners say that we should plant more trees in the middle of cities. Every new street should have trees on both sides, they say. Trees make the temperature lower, so we should have more trees in our parks and squares. We should also paint our roofs white. If we do this, they do not become so hot. Every roof in a hot and sunny country should have solar roof panels. The electricity from these can be used to run the air conditioners in the buildings. People continue to cut down forests around the cities. This makes the problem worse. Cities are growing faster and faster. By the year 2025, four fifths of the population will be living in cities. If we go on like this, there will not be enough farmland to feed everyone in the world	['Cities Are Getting Hotter']
The author cried when seeing pet commercials on television because .	DEAR AMY: We recently had to put our cat down. It came out of the blue. We had no idea that he had health problems, and we woke up early one morning to the cat crying out painfully. We immediately rushed him to the vet's where the vet said that at best treatment might lengthen his life by two to three months. We did not want to see him suffer, so we chose to kill the cat in a painless way. I am having a rough time! I cry when I am alone. I cry when I see pet commercials on television. I put away everything that reminds me of the cat. But the last sight of seeing the cat in pain plays over and over in my head. My kids seem alright with what has happened, but why am I struggling? It has only been one week since his passing, so I hope things will get better. Do you have any suggestions? Yours, Sad DEAR SAD: There is no loss quite like the loss of a pet; these animals keep us company through important life passages and are beloved witnesses to our human lives. I understand your instinct to put away all of your cat's things, but it may help you now to memorialize your pet by using these things. Each family member can write down favorite things about him or memories of him; read their memories aloud and put the papers inside his bowl. The idea is to replace those painful last memories with much more lively memories taking place over the most of the animal's life. Time will then do its job, which is to affect your feelings. And then, when you're ready, I hope you will adopt another animal and give it the opportunity to share your life. Yours, Amy	['she thought of her lovely cat']

Which of the following is NOT true?	If you do not use your arm or your legs for some time, they become weak; when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again. Everybody knows that. Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong. If a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault . But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents are to blame , and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but usually they have better memories? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things they cannot write down in a little notebook. They have to remember days, names, songs and stories; so their memory is the whole time being exercised. So if you want to have a good memory, learn from the people: Practice remembering.

Which of the following has the main character called Phileas Fogg?	Science fiction is a popular kind of writing, and many people think of Jules Verne as the father of science fiction. He was born in France in 1828. His father wanted him to become a lawyer , but when he was about twenty years old, Verne decided to become a writer. At first he wrote plays for the theater. Then, in 1863, he wrote a story called Five Weeks in a Balloon. The success of this book encouraged him to write more stories such as A Journey to the Center of the Earth(1864) and From the Earth to the Moon(1865). In the 19th century, many people were interested in science and inventions. Jules Verne wrote about scientific subjects in his stories and, as a result, they were very popular. Verne's writing included many predictions for the 20th century and many of them came true. He described space flight, movies, and air conditioning, a long time before they appeared. These books were very successful and they made Verne rich. Jules Verne's books have been the subjects for many movies. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was a successful movie for Walt Disney. It was the first Disney movie to use real actors instead of cartoon drawings. Around the World in Eighty Days is another famous movie based on one of Verne's books. The main character is an Englishman called Phileas Fogg. For him, the most important thing is to be always on time!	['Around the World in Eighty Days.']

Which of the following cannot help to reduce energy consumption effectively?	"International experts meeting in Australia say global carbon emissions can be reduced by more than 50 percent through simple energy saving measures. People at a conference in Australia, which increasingly relies on coal for power, say that reducing power consumption is an affordable way to both cut energy costs and reduce pollution. While many nations turn to cheap and dirty energy sources, such as coal, to meet their increasing energy needs, analysts in Australia say the best way to meet those needs is to improve energy efficiency. A range of simple solutions include using energy-efficient homes, household appliances and lighting, and driving electric cars. Encouraging homeowners and office workers to switch off their televisions and computers at the end of the day is also seen as an effective way to save electricity. Grayson Heffner, from the Paris-based International Energy Agency, says reducing consumption could greatly cut global carbon emissions. He calls efficiency strategies the ""soft giant"" of clean energy. ""We forecast that energy efficiency will deliver something like three-quarters of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions over the next 20 years. So in the short term energy efficiency is the main way that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions but oftentimes it is not so importantly stressed in the discussions,"" said Heffner. Energy experts working in China say the government is making significant cuts in power usage. Wan Xingwang, a Beijing-based representative of the Energy Foundation, a U.S. non-government organization, says the results have been impressive. ""In the past five years China achieved about 19.1 percent of energy reduction of its GDP. That translates to something like more than 600 million tons of coal savings,"" said Wan Xingwang. While most nations have some sort of government-sponsored energy efficiency programs, energy analysts say initiatives by individuals and companies can also help cut demand. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a non-profit group based in Washington, says other developing nations are recognizing the benefits of cutting power consumption and taking action."

"Someone believes _ if you 'have butterflies in the stomach"" before a test."	"Expressions cover all parts of our life. They may be around your ears every day. You may know a lot of Chinese expressions that describe how you feel. Here are some English ones for your enjoyment. Have Your Heart in Your Mouth This expression means that you're really afraid or anxious about something. When your heart starts beating so much that you can feel a thumping in your throat, it may feel like you ""have your heart in your mouth"". Have Butterflies in the Stomach How did butterflies get in your stomach? Well, those really aren't butterflies in there.

Some people believe having a few butterflies might even help you perform better. Sick as a Dog If you've ever been very sick, you may have used this expression. Because dogs eat just about anything they find, they often get sick. So it's all right to describe someone who's not feeling well as being ""sick as a dog"" .

The passage mainly wants to tell us _ .	"There are stock markets in large cities in many countries. Stock markets in Paris, London, Tokyo, Shanghai and New York are among the largest and most well-known. The stock, also called stock exchange, is a place where people can buy or sell shares of a factory or company. And each share means certain ownership of a factory or company. Different people go to stock markets. Some are rich, who want to get more money than they have. Others are not very rich, who buy stocks to try to become rich. Still others buy stocks as part of their plan to save money. Of course, investing money in the stock market is not the safest way to make money. No one can tell exactly whether the shares will be doing well. The factory or company may do badly. Then the stocks will go down, and the investors will lose money. The stock may go up or down for a number of untold reasons. Everyone wants the stock to go up, but sometimes even if a factory or company does a good job, the stock may still go down. Going to the stock market is often like gambling . All want to make money by ""gambling' in the stock market.

To become a special teacher, one needs _ .	I have been a special education teacher for 17 years and I wish more people would get into special education.The position is very demanding and there is always a shortage of special education teachers.It is not an easy profession to get into. One needs a BA in education and then a special education certificate such as a certificate in learning disabilities, emotional disabilities or cross categories which means covering all the subjects.A certified new special educate teacher needs to _ a current special education teacher for at least, a year because there is that much to know and practice. Working with the students is the biggest reward.However, the paperwork is huge with requesting more year after year.If you are good at doing about ten things at the same time, then you may be the right person for the job. No day is the same. Parent and government expectations are high. A sense of empathy(the ability of feeling and sharing another person's feelings) and one hundred percent prepared to help your students is important. Also, if you are a special education teacher working in the high school, it is your job to make sure your special education students are able to be employed after they graduate, and then the special education teacher needs to stay in touch with the special students a year after they graduate to make sure they are employed and can support themselves. Education is a very political field next to working in politics. One needs to know what to say, when to say it and make sure it is a benefit for everyone involved. It is a mixture of knowing medical diagnosis and teaching with that in mind. Your record needs to be perfect, and it would also help to be a very strong Christian because you will need to pray often to yourself. This position is not about the money but more of a service.

As a student of the school, you are probably asked to _ .	London Summer School in Classics Dates The London Summer School in Classics 2008 will be held at King's College London. It will run from 8th July until 17th July. Applications close on 2nd June, 2008. For an application form, please download either the 2-page PDF or the word format document from the foot of the page. If you have any problems downloading the application form or any questions, please contact: London Summer School in Classics, King's College London. Tel: 020 7848 2299 Fax: 020 7848 2545 Organization The school is organized by the colleges of the University of London. The summer school offers eight days of intensive teaching in Greek and Latin. There are four language classes each day as well as lectures and a debate, between 10:30 am and 4:30 pm. The course is not residential , and there is no teaching during the weekend of 12th to 13th July. The fee is PS85.00. Travel grants are available as a contribution to your travel costs, but may not cover all your expenses. The travel grants are arranged during the summer school. Teaching is generally in groups of 12-15 people and it, as far as possible, comprises of students of roughly the same level of experience. The style of teaching is friendly, but demanding: a lot of work is expected from students during the school, but they usually find the whole experience both stimulating and valuable. Some classes concentrate chiefly on reading, while others offer a mixture of grammar and translation practice. Our tutors include some of the most experienced and talented teachers of Classics in the London area and beyond. The Summer School in Classics caters for a wide range of interests and for both school & university students as well as those who wish to learn Greek or Latin, or to revive their knowledge of the languages. Our principal concern is to provide a thorough program of language learning in a lively university environment.	['do a lot of reading in Greek and Latin']

Adele's achievement seems unbelievable for the reason that _ .	"Last week Adele's second album, 21, sold 257,000 copies in the UK, a sales figure that would look incredible as an opening sales week for any album by any global superstar. The fact that the album was celebrating its 10th week at No.1, and that each of the previous nine weeks it had sold over 100,000 copies, makes what Adele has achieved look miraculous. The last female singer to spend that long at No.1 in the UK was Madonna in 1990 with her greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection. For Adele, the success of 21 is part of a perfect storm of talent, timing and a connection that went beyond gender, age and credibility. But what does it say about the state of the music industry? Does Adele's success signal a return to the MOR musical depression, when the likes of James Blunt dominated the charts? Her success may well lead to a great many similar acts aiming for an MOR audience, but that's more the fault of an industry desperate to recreate any kind of success by creating poor copies until the world shouts ""stop now"". What seems to have set Adele apart is her apparent ordinariness, besides that incredible voice. While Gaga parades around in a dress made of meat and Beyonce orbits a world out of touch to the majority of most human beings, Adele's chain-smoking, girl-you'd-like-to-go-to-the-pub-with persona stands out. Even for a British act, her ordinariness goes against trend, with fellow Jessie J adopting a very American habit of over-emoting, talking about a ""journey"" and making the idea of being a pop star seem fairly difficult. It's this universality and broad appeal that's helped her translate talent into sales. While the first single from 21, Rolling in the Deep, appealed to Radio 1 listeners and bloggers, the second single, Someone Like You, is so successful that silenced the grand O2 Arena during this year's Brit Awards. The press can write pages and pages in that there's enough of a connection of musicians - Rick Rubin worked on the album, there's a cover of the Cure, Mumford & Sons were an influence - while the gossip magazines have been excited by the fact that the album is one long break-up record, eager to find the ex. In 1990, Madonna was a global superstar with a back catalogue of era-defining hits to her name. She was untouchable and, tellingly, unknowable. She was (and still is) a megastar, but a megastar of a different age. These days, we want to know a bit more about our artists; that they have relationship problems, walk their dog. Her selling point and appeal is precisely the fact that she exists at the point between everyday ordinariness and pop star. For now, Adele's success should be celebrated, especially for becoming an unlikely global star on her own terms. The danger is that we're headed for a lot of fairly boring pop, a situation that led to the ""birth"" of Gaga a few years back. Pop goes in cycles and it feels like we're headed back towards the very middle of MOR."	['her second album ranked first in a row with the incredible average sales per week']
What is the min topic of the passage?	"Bicycles, a long-forgotten vehicle that seems to belong to the last century, are returning to the streets of Guangzhou, as the city starts to ban the running of motorcycle in urban Guangzhou. ""Business has never been so good for my shop,"" said Chen Yongwu, a bicycle shop owner at the city's Donghua West Road, ""I have to work 12 hours a day to meet the demand of my customers. "" ""Even my wife and brother-in-law have to give me a hand lately. "" Chen originally ran a motorcycle repair shop. He grasped the opportunity of the motorcycle ban, and started his bicycle business soon after hearing about the banning. ""I sold 23 bicycles on January 2 alone. "" Said Chen. Bicycle is more convenient and healthier ""My home is one kilometer from the metro station,"" said a middle-aged man who is waiting for his bicycle at Chen's shop, ""it is too tiresome to walk to the station, but taking a bus for such a short distance is a waste of money. "" ""So I decided to buy a bicycle. "" The bicycle costs around 600 yuan, which is equal to the bus fare of half a year. ""Besides, riding a bicycle to work is much healthier than riding a bus. "" The bicycle buyers can be categorized into two groups. One group of buyers buy the bicycles for the transportation of small commodities; the other ride the bicycles to work. Arising problems Riding a bicycle to work may be healthy, but it is not without problems. The lack of bicycle lanes has posed a big threat to the safety of the bicycle riders in Guangzhou. ""I was riding my bicycle on Huifu West Road on day,"" said Mr. Zhang, ""then suddenly the bus pulled over besides me near the bus station. "" ""I was so frightened at the time, because the bus nearly hit me. "" The sideways in Guangzhou are usually crowded with foot passengers, so citizens also could not use the sideways.

Which is acceptable according to the passage?	Children are children after all, and most of them speak their mind. When they are just toddlers , they are all lovely and lively. And it's so interesting to watch them speak like a grown-up. But as they grow, these same kids seem annoying and ill-mannered if they try to be a grown-up. Conflicts go between parents and children. It's hard to tell who are right and who are wrong. A child of 7-8 always finds some reasons to have a conflict with it's parents. Whether it is about some toy, studies, a party or a company, there is always a difference between them. And it becomes worse when they answer you back. Scientists tell us that children should be treated with care. Yes, sure they should respect their elders. We are partly responsible for this. At an early age we encourage children to behave like adults, just because we find it funny. The kids on the other hand consider this same behavior as normal and get used to it. And when it is not funny for us any more, we expect them to stop it, but by then it is already too late. Only when they reach a certain maturity will the children realize that answering back and being rude are not acceptable . Until then, most of the time their behavior is difficult to change, unless by force . And use of force is against the every good idea, as it weakens the child's confidence. So it is one thing to bring a child into this world but quite another to make them into well mannered citizens. The best way is to be a good example ourselves, as our children are the mirrors of us adults.	['Respecting elders.']
According to the passage, which of the following could be the best trigger?	Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule. The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes. That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer. So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells.	['NIR light.']
Why do Robert's parents ask him to live upstairs?	"Robert is sixteen now. He'll finish middle school in two years. His father has a shop and got much money. He hopes his son can go to university and makes him study hard. But the young man likes to play cards. He has to go out when his parents fall asleep. One night, when Robert came back, his father happened to see him. The old man was very angry and told his son to live upstairs. Robert has to go up and down quietly. Of course it troubles him. He thought and thought but didn't find a way. Last evening Robert listened carefully. And he was sure his parents went to sleep, he went out to play cards with his friends. He won some money and was happy. And he got back, he took off his shoes and was going upstairs. He heard a noise in his parents' bedroom. He stood behind the door and saw a man come out. He understood it was a thief . He stopped him at once. The man was very afraid and brought out all the things he stole in the room. ""Tell me how you didn't wake my parents up,"" said Robert. ""Or I'll take you to the police station!"""	['Because they can hear if Robert goes out at night.']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Electronic books have changed the way many people read for pleasure. Now online textbooks are changing the way some students learn and some teachers teach. More than one hundred seventy-five thousand students attend the public schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, outside Washington. Last year, the school system used digital books in fifteen schools. This school year, middle schools and high schools changed from printed to electronic textbooks in their social studies classes. Luke Rosa is a history teacher at Falls Church High School. His students work on laptop computers at school. He explains the idea to them this way. ""I mean, it's just like a regular textbook, except it's got it all online."" Peter Noonan, an assistant superintendent of schools, said, ""The world's changing. And the online textbooks can change right along with the events that are happening."" Digital books also cost less than printed textbooks, he said. A student named Melanie Reuter said, ""I don't have to carry a textbook around, so that's nice."" But another student said, ""I don't like it because the Internet sometimes doesn't work."" Students also need access to the Internet when they are not at school. About ten percent of students in Fairfax Country do not have a computer or online access at home. Public libraries in the country have free Internet. There are also after-school computer labs as well as computer clubhouse supported by the country. Middle school student Slieman Hakim is happy about that. He said, ""My family only has one computer; my sister and I both do our homework on it. So I come here to do my homework. It's good."" Other school systems in the area are also considering online textbooks."	['Students can do their homework in the computer clubhouses.']
The author tends to tell us _ .	"Since the pre-historic times, man has had an urge to satisfy his needs.Whether it is hunger, shelter or search for a mate, he has always controlled the situations to his advantage.Probably this might be the reason why we humans are the most developed of all living species on the earth.As we climbed the steps of development, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking --we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of time. If you are hungry, what do you do? Get a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet.Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such things.So it silently began to care about your needs and never let itself grow.When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop.This might be the reason why we all sometimes think ""What happens next?"", ""Why can't I think?"" ""Why am I always given the difficult, problems?"" Well, this is the result of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through reading.Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to turn to reading.You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your ""How to?"" questions.The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas. The same seed, if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would have never thought in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity.If you read more books, your mind will open up like never before."	['reading can feed your mind']
How many people of all respondents end a love affair via text?	"Cellphone feels like a part of your body? A global survey has found that most people can't live without their mobiles, never leave home without them and, if given a choice, would rather lose their wallet.[: _ ] Calling mobile phones the ""remote control"" for life, market research firm Synovate's poll said cell phones are so ubiquitous that by last year more humans owned one than did not. Three-quarters of the more than 8,000 respondents polled online in 11 countries said they take their phone with them everywhere, which Russians and Singaporeans the most attached. More than a third also said they couldn't live without their phone, topped by Taiwanese and again Singaporeans, while one in four would find it harder to replace the mobile than their purse. Some two thirds of respondents go to bed with their phones nearby and can't switch them off, even though they want to, because they're afraid they'll miss something. Mobiles have changed the nature of relationships, with the survey finding a fifth of all respondents set up first dates via text and almost the same number use the same method to end a love affair. Apart from the obvious calling and SMS-ing, the top three features people use regularly on their mobile phones globally are the alarm clock, the camera and the games. As for email and Internet access, 17 percent of respondents said they checked their inboxes or surfed the Web on their phones, led by those in the United States and Britain. One in 10 respondents log onto social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace regularly via mobile, again led by Britain and the United States.[:Zxxk.Com] Not everyone is tech savvy , however,37 percent of respondents said they don't know how to use all the functions on their phone."

Why does the writer want a personal motto?	"For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted a personal motto. I wanted a saying that I could really try to live my life by. I mean all the humorous book and storybook heroes always have a personal principle they follow. Good manners! Courage! Keenness! But a part of me could never get myself to create my own motto because I never knew where to start and I never thought I could give one. ""With great power comes great responsibility."" is a quote by the great writer and philosopher, Voltaire. More familiar, it makes an appearance in the modern day movie performance of the superhero Spider-Man. This saying provides a sense of responsibility for those with actually limitless power. ""Be good to others and others will be good to you."" is another well-known proverb that has roots in almost all of the major religions. Although it is less practiced today than it is lectured, it is a powerful and good motto to live by. Kindness, in this sense, is the final power in judging every action. My personal motto today has an idea - being efficient. Through my limited knowledge, I have come to find that this is simply the best way for me to give insight about who I am and what I believe in. Efficiency is a quality that everyone desires for, right? Who doesn't want to be able to not only work fast but to achieve great results? To some, it may appear to be a frightening journey. But to me, it means that I have a lifelong journey to improve the methods and ideas with which I come near my tasks. Regardless of what motto you want to live by, I believe that everyone should have one, or two or more. These are all symbols of a perfect story of us, in our own view. And it immediately provides insight to the type of person we were, we are and what we strive to be. We are never meant to be perfect, but it is important to try and live by a belief that will help us reach our potential. All you have to do is know what your excitement is and live by it."

Which of the following describes bacteria correctly?	"Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including ammonia that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony and form a layer of slime in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases. That slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it. ""This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,"" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight. ""The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,"" he added. Their findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time. ""It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,"" Dr. Nijland said. ""Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier."""	['They cannot hear.']

When Langston Hughes became great he was _ Steven Spielberg, who becomes popular.	"What could a poem writer and a movie director share? More than you think! Langston Hughes began writing poems in high school and soon became one of America's greatest writers. Most of his writing is about his experiences as an African American. He wrote poems about people who worked hard through life but still found things to be happy about. He wrote plays and books about justice for all people, and he wrote kids' books, too. The Sweet and Sour Animal Book is a book of his animal poems. Pictures and photos were used in the book. ""Hold fast to dreams"" is a line in a famous Hughes poem. That's exactly what he did throughout his life. When Steven Spielberg was in middle school, he wanted to make a film. He had an idea for a movie, but no money. He started a tree-planting business and made his film with the money he earned. Spielberg never stopped making films, even after many film schools refused him. Today he is one of the most popular and important filmmakers in the world. His movies are about people who are adventurous , brave, kind. His characters often fight for what is good. Some of his films are about his Jewish background, such as Schindler's List. Spielberg once said, ""I don't dream that much at night because I dream for a living."" In different ways, both Hughes and Spielberg have encouraged people of all ages to reach for their dreams."	['younger than']
Earthquakes_.	The Ring of Fire covers 4,000 km around the edge of the Pacific Ocean.It includes the countries of Japan,Indonesia and the Philippines.More earthquakes and volcanoes occur in this area than anywhere else in the world.The name Ring of Fire refers to areas below the earth's surface.These areas move suddenly and often cause earthquakes and create volcanoes. Many areas of Asia,such as the Philippines,Japan,and Indonesia, sometime experience earthquakes and volcanoes.There are occasionally landslides ,mudslides,and tidal waves as a result.Fortunately, these natural disasters do not happen very often. Southern China is about 600 km away from the Ring of Fire.Sometimes, people in this region feel earthquakes too.The worst earthquake felt in southern China was in 1918 in Shantou.It measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.Any earthquake of 6 or more on the Richter scale is very dangerous to people. People in Hong Kong sometimes experience the effects of earthquakes and volcanoes.In September 1994,for example,the strongest earthquake to hit Hong Kong for 76 years shook buildings and scared thousands of residents.Frightened workers and families ran out of their offices and homes.The earthquake measured 6.5 on the Richter seal. It is difficult to predict when an earthquake will occur In countries within the Ring of Fire, buildings must be very strong because the effects of earthquakes on buildings are terrible. In June 1991, Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted.Many people were killed and the area surrounding the volcano was badly damaged.Hot ash and liquid rock from the volcano forced people to leave the area.They only returned many months later.The ash spread over a large area.Even people in the Guangdong region of southern China saw ash in the air.

Being poor is a terrible feeling when your 3-year-old finishes his meal and says: ""Can I have some more bread and jam please, Mummy?"" And you break down in tears, because you don't know how to tell him that there is no more food. With PS6, I went to the supermarket, picked up some food and started to cook at home. It was time for me to make a change and get back on my feet. I began to write a series of articles for the website named Hunger Hurt in July 2011. A few months later, local food bank gave me some help-- with some free vegetables every month, which made my life a little easier. I began to write recipes , posting them on my blog. To my surprise, families, students and those poor people told me how much it helped to see healthy recipes made from affordable supermarket vegetables. My Life took unexpected turns. I was invited to give a speech on food , interviewed for an Oxfam report on food banks and asked to write a cookery book. When I got the money from the book, for the first night in almost two years, I went to bed without worrying.

"Why does the passage say "" Peace and quiet are becoming harder to find "" ?"	"Our sense of hearing is one of the most important means of knowing what is going on around us. We are warned of danger by sounds. The sounds of music please us. Sound has a waste product, too, in the form of noise. Noise has been called unwanted sound. Noise is growing and it may get much worse before it gets any better. Scientists, for several years, have been studying how noise affects people and animals and are alarmed by what they have learned. Peace and quiet are becoming harder to find. Noise pollution is no joke. It is a threat that should be looked at carefully. Sound is measured in units called decibels . At a level of 140 decibels people feel pain in their ears. Trucks, buses, motorcycles, airplanes, boats, and factories all make noise. This noise bothers not only our ears, but our minds and bodies as well. There is a saying about ""it is so noisy that you can't hear yourself think"". Doctors who study noise believe that we must be able to hear ourselves think most of the time. If we don't, we may have headaches, other aches and pains, or even mental problems. Noise adds even more tension to a society which already faces too much stress."	['The world is making more and more noise.']
Why did Katzmarzyk and his colleagues turn to a government-run survey?	"New research suggests that cutting daily sitting time to less than three hours might extend your life by two years. ""Humans were designed to move. But modern lifestyles and office jobs rarely encourage us to walk around,"" says Peter Katzmarzyk, an expert at the University of Louisiana. ""Sitting is common in our lives today. We sit while we're driving, eating and watching TV. And many of us sit for many hours at work."" Katzmarzyk said. ""We can't throw away physical activity. It's extremely important. We have 60 years of researchers showing us that."" Katzmarzyk said. Katzmarzyk and other researchers are trying to discover how sitting all day affext our lifespans . ""This is a relatively new area of study...Studies that have assessed the relationship between sitting and death or television viewing and death have been very rare in the last four or five years,"" said Katzmarzyk. Katzmarzyk and his colleagues analyzed data from these studies, which involved almost 167,000 adults. Then they turned to a government-run survey of Americans to find out exactly how much time people spend sitting and watching. Not only did the team find that U.S. citizens could live longer by sitting less, they found that cutting TV time to less than two hours a day could add an extra 1.4 years to their lives. People who've spent half their waking lives sitting down might well ask, ""Is it ever too late to make a change?"" ""We would say 'No. It's never too late.' Physical activity is good for you at every age."" Katzmarzyk said. Katzmarzyk says studying this problem has inspired his team to make a few changes in their own lives. They recommend a few simple changes: frequently getting up from your desk, taking walks at lunch time, and instead of e-mailing colleagues, walking over to their offices and talking face-to-face----all activities that can be enjoyable as well as life-extending."

The reason for doing the experiment secretly is that the researchers _ .	"Honesty may well be the policy, but it often deserts us when no one is watching, psychologists report today. Experiments with an honesty box to collect payments for hot drinks show that people are better at paying up when under the gaze of a pair of eyes. The surprise was that the eyes were not real, but photographed. Researchers at Newcastle University set up the experiment in secret. They attached a poster to a cupboard of mugs above an-honesty box alongside a kettle ,with tea, coffee and milk. Over 10 weeks, they alternated each week between images of eyes and pictures of flowers. Dr. Bateson, a behavioral biologist and leader of the study, said that even though the eyes were not real they still seemed to make people behave more honestly. They effect may arise from behavioral characteristics that developed as early humans formed social groups that increased their chances of survival. Individuals had to co-operate for the good of the group, rather than act selfishly. ""If nobody is watching us, it is in our interests to behave selfishly. But when we think we're being watched,we should behave better, so people see us as co-operative and behave the same way towards us, ""Dr. Bateson said. ""We thought we'd get a slight effect with eyes, but it was quite striking how much difference they made. Even at a subconscious level, it seems people respond to eyes, and that might be because eyes send a strong biological signal we have evolved to respond to."" The finding, which researchers believe _ our evolutionary past, could be turned to practical use. The psychologists say images of eyes could promote ticket sales on public transport and improve monitor systems to prevent antisocial behavior."	['wanted to get a comparatively more exact result']
In this passage the author mainly discusses_.	"If you feel at present that you don't have enough friends in your life,one reason may be that you have let yourself become too busy to make time for the relationships you already have.Starting and keeping friendship requires effort and commitment. Many of us let our lives become so busy with work and other commitments that we don't get around to scheduling time for pleasure and renewal with the friends,relatives and acquaintances we already have. Making the effort to call your friends more regularly and to accept more of the invitations you receive from others can improve your social life in a hurry! Are there any people you could call right now and be assured of a pleasant welcome? Are there people that you could count on to help you in time of difficulty? Can you have close talks with them? Do you have fun when you are together? Are you happy to have them in your life? If you haven't seen much of them lately. is it because you have become too busy? Have you grown apart? Was there an argument? If the main reason you haven't been getting together with the people you already know is that you have gotten too busy,take a good look at how you spend your time.Compare it with your real values and priorities in life.Is your busy lifestyle really bringing you the quality of life that you want? If you have become too busy for friends,why has this happened? Are you seeking material toys in your life at the expense of relationships with other human beings? Have you allowed your time to be over.committed because you never say""No""to anyone? Do you insist on doing things yourself that could be delegated to others? If so,why? Do you believe that everything depends on you? Examine whether the way you are now spending your time accurately reflects your deepest values and priorities.Make sure that you schedule enough time for the things that are truly most important to you.

Why does the author write the letter?	"This is an open letter to the three people who stole my handbag from the department store where I am employed as a shop assistant. When you took my bag, I don't know what you thought you were going to get. With my wages, there's not much left on a Tuesday. I hope the PS5 was useful to you. If you really need a couple of pounds, I suppose you could always cash one of the two checks left in my check book. Of course, I phoned the bank right away and the check-cashing card is no longer valid, so it won't be of much use to you. Actually I don't care about the money too much. We single parents who work to support our families understand only too well what it means to be short of cash. However, I don't suppose it went very far among the three of you. Sorry about that! I wish you had left the bag behind and just taken the wallet and check book. There were all kinds of papers and notes that I really need. I really think that was very inconsiderate of you. I mean, how would you like something like that to happen to you? Well, perhaps the bag will turn up. It wasn't even an expensive one, just a plain, old brown leather shoulder bag. You probably threw it in the nearest rubbish bin or threw it into the bushes. We've looked around, of course, but no one saw which way you went after you left the shop. I'm not really angry with you. I know how the pressures of modern life can affect us, but I am sad at the loss of my personal things. I feel helpless. The police were very icy, and they just shrugged their shoulders. ""It happens all the time,"" they told me. Some small comfort, I suppose. But I've lost just a little more faith in human nature. And as my young son said when I told him what had happened, ""Why? Mummy, why us?"" I couldn't answer that question. I wonder if you can."	['To complain about the fall of morality.']

"What does Lang Ping mean by saying ""It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team.""?"	"A couple of years ago, before a trip to China, Nicole Davis and her US women's volleyball teammates were warned about the prominence (, ) of coach ""Jenny"" Lang Ping in her native country. ""I was pushed over by Chinese journalists while I was just trying to put my luggage on the bus,"" said Davis. Known as the ""Iron Hammer"" for her punishing spikes , Lang made it possible for China to dominate in the sport in the early 1980s. She was a key player on China's 1984 Olympic gold medal winning team. When the US team arrived for the Olympics, Lang, 48, who is from Beijing, had to take a different route to avoid a crowd of reporters and fans. Then came the greatest moment to Lang:while the US team was playing in a packed gym, at least 8,000 Chinese fans _ an American flag. ""That really says it all,"" Davis said. ""They look at her as an icon .I'm sure it's hard for them to see her coaching another country, but they love her so deeply that her success is their success."" The loyalty of the Chinese fans was tested on Friday, when China lost a match to the US. ""It's a pity that China lost the match, but I'm still glad that Lang Ping's team won, since she is the pride of China's volleyball,"" said Liu Chengli, a spectator. ""We also cheered for Lang's victory."" Lang said she just tried to stay professional when the two teams meet. ""It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team. It's the same."" Lang said. Davis said she and her teammates could not have imagined the passion for volleyball among Chinese because the sport was lack of popularity in the US. The reception from Chinese fans has touched the US players, said a US volleyball player Lindsey Berg. ""It's such an honor to be here and play for our coach here in China,"" she said. ""The amount of support that the Chinese give to her and us has been tremendous. The whole event has been unbelievable."""	['She just tried to stay professional.']

What didn't Reagan do in his life time?	"Lifeguard, sportscaster, movie star, governor, president----there wasn't much Ronald Reagan didn't do in life. ""The world was a vast opportunity for him,"" Lou Cannon wrote in his biography of the former US president, who died on June 5,2004, aged 93. Reagan's final years saw him fight a losing battle against Alzheimer's disease . But his positive attitude toward life has given hope to many people. Born in 1911 to a poor family in a small town in Illinois, his father was a failed salesman who drank too much. It was in these difficult times, though, that Reagan developed the powerful optimism that would serve him so well. He always believed better times lying ahead, and this was reflected in his high school yearbook entry. ""Life is one grand, sweet song, so start the music,"" he wrote. As a teenager, Reagan spent summers working as a lifeguard at a local beach, saving 77 lives in seven years. He graduated from college in 1932 with a degree in economics and sociology. But America was still in the middle of the Great Depression, and jobs were hard to find. Reagan finally found work as a radio sports announcer and this road led him to Hollywood in 1937. During the 20---year film career, he never became a leading star. As in his lifeguard days, Reagan loved to play the hero and only took the role of a bad guy once in more than 50 films. A talented speaker who was always able to connect with his audience, Reagan became involved in politics in the 1950s. This popular touch led to him being elected the governor of California in 1967. All the while Reagan was in California, he had his eye on the White House. In 1980, aged 69, he became the oldest man ever elected president. He held office from 1981 to 1989, the first president to serve two complete terms after World War II. When he left, aged 77, he held the highest popularity rate of any retiring president in US history. He remained positive even when he discovered he had an illness that would destroy him. ""I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal(optimism for its future,""he wrote."	['Being a leading star of the film.']

It can be concluded from Isabelle Dinoire's remarks that _ .	"Can you imagine being savagely attacked by a dog? What if the attack was so severe that your nose, lips and chin were completely destroyed? How would you feel about yourself? Would you be able to look at yourself in the mirror? And how do you think other people would treat you? Isabelle Dinoire is someone who can answer all of these questions honestly and openly. Last November Isabelle was attacked and mauled by her own dog. The attack was so severe that her lower face was damaged; it seemed, almost beyond repair. She was rushed to hospital and became the first person ever to have a face transplant. With such severe injuries doctors offered Isabelle little hope that they would be able to repair the damage to her face using conventional surgery. Shortly after being admitted, she came to the attention of Dr Bernard Devauchelle who, unlike other surgeons, believed there was an alternative: ""We found ourselves saying, yes, it's clear this woman needs a transplant,"" he said. Two days after the operation she saw her face in the mirror for the first time. She said ""I was scared to look at myself, but when I did it was already marvelous and I couldn't believe it. I thought it would be blue and swollen but it was already beautiful."" Now, less than a year after her 15 hour operation, she's trying to rebuild her life and there is no doubt how she feels about her new face: ""I have been saved. Lots of people write saying that I need to go on, that it's wonderful. It's a miracle somehow."" Although there were ethical questions raised about their decision to carry out the procedure, the doctors who operated on Isabelle are quick to defend their decision. One of them said ""Was it possible for her to live without a face? It's easy to say we shouldn't have done the operation, but her life has changed, she goes shopping, goes on holiday, she lives again."""	['she was satisfied with the result of the operation']
The passage is written mainly to _ .	"As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder. Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage. Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X. Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme. ""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities. One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti. Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important.

"According to the writer, ""you won't need the international language of English"" because _ ."	"Very soon a computer will be able to teach you English. It will also be able to translate any language for you,too. It's just one more incredible result of the development of microprocessors - those tiny parts of a computer commonly known as ""silicon chips"". So give up going to classes, stop buying more textbooks and relax. In a couple of years you won't need the international language of English. Already Texas Instruments in the United States is developing an electronic translation machine. Imagine a Spanish secretary, for example, who wants to type a letter from the boss to a businessman in Sweden. All he or she will have to do is this: first type the letter in Spanish. The letter will appear on a television screen. After a few seconds the translated letter will appear on another television screen in Stockholm in perfect Swedish. And that's not all. Soon a computer will be able to teach you English, if you really want to learn the language. You'll sit in front of a television screen and practice endless structures. The computer will tell you when you are correct and when you are wrong. It will even talk to you because the silicon chips can change electrical impulses into sounds. And clever programmers can predict the responses you, the learner, are likely to make. So think of it.You will be able to teach yourself at your own pace.You will waste very little time,and you can work at home.And if after all that,you still can't speak English,you can always use the translating machine.In a few years,therefore,perhaps there will be no need for BBC Modern English,or BBC English by Radio programmes - no more textbooks or teachers of English.Instead of buying an exciting new textbook,the computer will ask you to replace it with a microprocessor.Fast,reliable and efficient language learning and translating facilities will be available to you.Think of that,no more tears or embarrassing moments.One little problem is that a computer can't laugh yet - but the scientists are working on it.Happy learning!"

How many people have died from shark attacks according to the passage?	"The smart phones that can take self-portraits or selfies have set us free. We can now document every moment of our life and instantly share it with the world through the Internet. However, some believe that it's also causing people to take unnecessary risks that sometimes prove to be deadly! According to recent reports, the desire to take a breathtaking selfie has killed 12 people. Though that may not seem like a lot, it's 50% more than the death from shark attacks. While the issues have been known for a while, they came to a head on September 21st, following the accidental death of Hideto Ueda at the Taj Mahal. It turns out that the 66-year-old Japanese and his companion were trying to take a selfie with the Royal Gate as the background when they fell down some stairs. While the friend escaped with a broken leg, Ueda was not as fortunate. He suffered a head injury and died soon after. Other fatal accidents include a 21-year-old Russian woman who fell off a bridge while trying to capture an exciting self-portrait. Three Indian students suffered a similar fate after they were run over by a train while taking a selfie on the railway tracks. The rising number of injuries is forcing officials to take measures. Russia has begun a nationwide awareness program to make its young citizens aware of the dangers of this safe hobby. The campaign's slogan is:""Even a million 'likes' on social media are not worth your life and well-being."" Though no other country has followed their lead, many are banning the selfie stick! In the last few months many museums, and theme parks including Disney, have banned its use. JR West became the first institution worldwide to ban the sticks both inside Japan's bullet trains as well as out on the railway platforms. While these measures may help reduce the incidents, the only way to stop selfie-related injuries and deaths is to take responsibility -- not just for themselves but their friends. So next time you decide to take a selfie that appears a little risky, be sure to stop and ask yourself -- is it worth it?"	['Eight.']
What's Becky Hashim's attitude towards the relationship between physical fitness and academic performance?	"FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. ""The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,"" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. ""Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive and academic benefits that come from physical fitness"", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading tests. For boys, perceived social support also seemed to increase their reading scores, the investigators found. In girls, while being physically fit predicted higher reading scores, so too did a higher BMI-- which indicates more body fat. ""We were a little surprised by this finding,"" Petrie said. ""It was not as strong an association as the one with physical fitness,"" he added. The authors suspect it may have something to do with girls this age entering adolescence, which may be related to a higher BMI and slightly higher brain development. He said he plans to make great effort to look for this relationship again in larger studies to see if it was a chance finding, or if the association holds up. ""While we can't say 100 percent that physical fitness causes better academic performance, we can say that there is a strong and predictive relationship between physical fitness and academic performance,"" Petrie said. ""It's hard to tease apart the exact reason for this association,"" said Becky Hashim, an attending clinical psychologist and assistant professor in the departments of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Montefiore, in New York City. ""It may be that the children are getting more oxygen. When the heart and lungs are working at a higher capacity, it may allow the brain to work at peak performance. Children who are less fit may be sleepier during school,"" she noted. ""I personally feel that there's probably a strong relationship between the confidence you get from being able to do something physical well and academic performance."" Whatever the reason behind this association may be, ""there's certainly no harm in pushing physical fitness,"" Hashim added. ""Physical fitness may make you feel better, give you more confidence and improve your performance across the board,"" she said. Petrie agreed. ""Physically fit kids are happier, have higher self-esteem and, tend to have better relationships, and now we're beginning to see that there also seem to be benefits cognitively and academically. Our study sends a strong warning to policymakers to reconsider the service program of physical education classes for kids,"" he said."	['Supportive']

Which of the following attractions may interest those who want to study the military (of the army) history of Mexico City?	"Mexico City is truly one of the most amazing cities in the world with a mixture of both the old and new world. From the moment your plane starts to land in this vast city, you know that your trip will be quite an adventure. Once in your taxi and the moment you leave the airport, you are amazed at the large amount of slow traffic. The volume of the traffic can be stressful to some. The ""Paseo de la Reforma "", running southwest across the city, is one of the major tourist and business areas in Mexico City with many high quality hotels only walking distance from great restaurants and other tourist attractions. The only problem you will have is trying to see all of these sites during your vacation time. One of the most popular attractions in this area is the National Museum of Anthropology along the northwest part of the street. There are thousands of artifacts on display showing the history of the area and numerous items found from the many Aztec sites in the area. Walking southwest from the museum, you will soon reach the Mexico City Zoo, which is a great place to spend an afternoon. Across the street from the museum is the Chapultepec Castle, once an important site in the Mexican-American war. It's also a good idea to take the train up the hill to where the castle is located as the hill is steep . It's important to keep in mind that Mexico City is over 7,000 feet above sea level and some feel it difficult to breathe when walking. You can take a taxi to the Coyoacan market during the evening on a weekend. It's a great place to get some cheap souvenirs to bring back home and to enjoy some traditional Mexican cuisine.

However, you don't need to look in the telephone book for your best friend's number because you already know it. This information is in your long-term memory. Your long-term memory has everything that you remember through the years. The major reason for forgetting something is because you do not learn it well at the beginning.

An outstanding Opening Ceremony, splendid athletic performances in perfect stadiums, the best-ever Paralympic Villages, amazing high definition television coverage, a never ending and self-generating supply of passion and emotion, superb organization, wonderful volunteers, millions of new Paralympic sports lovers both here in China and around the world. These are the greatest Paralympic Games ever. --Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympic Committee It was another spectacular show. Perhaps it's not quite as sublimely beautiful as the opening, but a fitting end to what has been a memorable 12 days in the Chinese capital. The Paralympics were inspiring.

According to Liu Qianguang, _ .	"You may have known several kinds of police --- traffic police, fire police and street police. But have you ever heard of energy-saving policeman? A group of 22 energy-saving policemen went to work last week in Beijing. They go around the city to see the use of energy in hotels, office buildings, shopping centers and other public places. One of their aims is to make sure that these places have set their air conditioning no cooler than 26degC. They also set up a special phone line so that people can tell them which buildings fail to follow the rule. ""If everyone sets their air conditioning at 26degC, Beijing will save 400 million kilowatthour of electricity in one summer. That's one-third of all the usages of the city in the season,"" said a TV advertisement. Other Chinese cities, like Wuhan in Hubei Province and Yangzhou in Jiansu Province, are going to follow Beijing's steps in setting up a similar police team. As one of the fastest developing countries, China is using a lot of energy. This has a great effect on the country's environment and limited energy. From 1986 to 2005, the country experienced 20 warm winters continuously . Numbers show that Chinese cities have to spend billions of yuan solving environmental problems every year. At the beginning of this month, China made its first action plan to fight pollution. It aims to reduce energy usage by 20% and increase renewable energy up to 10% from 7% by 2010. To introduce the public to a green life, last week Beijing held a show on energy-saving technology and productions. Environment-friendly machines, such as a vending machine that helps collect used bottles, have attracted lots of attention. ""We want to tell people that there are certain ways to protect the environment. Each of us can find effective ways to do it on our daily lives,"" said Liu Qianguang, an environmental engineer in Beijing."	"[""it's easy for one to do something good for the   environment""]"

The police officers watched many places except _ .	"On August 15, 2011,the Ministry Publish Security started a campaign to educate drivers about the dangers of driving after drinking. As a part of the campaign, police officers watched bars, restaurants and KTVs in Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei and Guangdong. It ended up on December 30. But it told the drivers the meaning of the new traffic laws and the dangers of drinking. In Beijing, some restaurants put up notices and told drivers about their responsibility. ""Usually if a group of guests come by car, the driver won't drink. If he does, we will remind him,"" said a waitress from Dongfang Restaurant in Beijing. Fewer drivers are drinking alcohol nowadays, since many know about the campaign. Wang Lankun, a traffic policeman in Beijing said, ""Some drivers think a glass of beer is not a problem. But a blood test will show that their blood-alcohol level is more than 20mg for each 100ml of blood, that is enough to affect their driving."" During the campaign, drivers who have a blood-alcohol level of over 20mg for each 100ml of blood will get a fine of 500 yuan. Also, they will not be allowed to drive for three months. In fact, there are strict laws to punish drunk driving in many other countries. For example, in the USA, if someone has a blood-alcohol level of over 80mg for each 100ml of blood, he will be sent to prison for one year. But in Britain, he will be fined 5,000 pounds and banned from driving for 12 months, also he will be sent to prison for 6 months. In Germany, if a driver has a blood-alcohol level of over 60mg for each 100ml of blood, he won't be allowed to drive until he passes a new driving test."	['schools']
The research at Duke University indicated that _	In the 19th century, there used to be a model of how to be a good person. There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit disturbing, because the important habitual neural networks are not formed by mere routine, nor can they be reversed by clever cues. They are burned in by emotion and strengthened by strong yearnings, like the yearnings for admiration and righteousness. If you think you can change your life in a clever way, the way an advertiser can get you to buy an air freshener, you're probably wrong. As the Victorians understood, if you want to change your life, don't just look for a clever cue. Commit to some larger global belief.	"[""Habit plays a vital role in one's behavior.""]"
Black people in American used to _ before Martin Luther King Jr.	Like many people ,I have no clear idea about heroes . A t some point , we all wonder if we need a hero and what a hero really is. Although there are a lot of differences in cultures, heroes around the world generally share a number of characteristics which give us courage and make us want to learn from them. A hero does something worth talking about, A hero has a special story to tell and people think highly of it. But a hero is not just person with great fame . A hero has power larger than himself . Some people want to live like a hero. And they have to experience life with new and further meaning .A sure test for would- be heroes is what or whom they serve. What do they want to live and die for? If their answer suggests they serve only own fames, they may be famous persons but not heroes. A hero has a _ from the mountain top .He has the power to move people . He creates new possibility. Without Gandhi, India might still be part of Britain, Without Martin Luther King .Jr, Americans might take different parks , and shop in different stores of the different colors of their skins. There might be changes in society without a hero, but the speed of the change would be rather slow . Thanks to heroes in history ,they make the society develop so rapidly.

Which statement is NOT TRUE according to the passage ?	"The use of mobile phones over a long period of time can raise the risk for brain tumors , a new Swedish study said on Friday , contradicting (......) the conclusions of other researchers . The Dutch Health Council , in an overview of research from around the world , last year found no evidence radiation from mobile phones and TV towers was harmful . A four-year British survey released in January showed no link between regular . long-term use of cell phones and the most common type of tumor . However , researchers at the Swedish National Institute for Working Life said they looked at the mobile phone use of 905 people between the age of 20 and 80 who had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and found a link "" A total 80 of these 905 cases were so-called high users of mobile phones , that is they began early to use mobile and or wireless telephones and used them a lot , "" the study said . "" The study also shows that the rise in risk is noticeable for tumors on the sided of the head where the phone was said to be used , "" it added . Kjell Mild , who led the study , said the figures meant that heavy users of mobile phones , for instance of who make mobile phone calls for 2 , 000 hours or more in their life , had a 240 percent increased risk for a malignant tumor on the side of the head the phone is used . "" The way to the risk down is to use handsfree , "" he told Reuters .

"In America people try to avoid using the word ""old"" because _"	"""I'm seventy years old,"" says the gray-haired lady proudly to the entertainer at her Community Club dinner. ""Did you hear that, everyone?"" says the entertainer. ""This lovely lady is just seventy years young! And she doesn't look a day over fifty. "" He has been careful not to use the word ""old"". In a society where youth is so admired, old age is often seen as something sad, something to fight against. Americans prefer not to say ""old"" people. They use the expression ""senior citizens"". They do not talk about ""old people's"" homes, but ""retirement"" homes. In fact, the entertainer is not so wrong. Seventy is not very old these days. People in theprefix = st1 /USare living longer and longer. In1980, 12 percent of Americans were over sixty-five years old. By 2030, 21 percent will be over sixty-five. One reason for this is that families are getting smaller. The average couple now has only 1. 8 children. At the same time, improved medical care means that people are living longer. This change in the age of Americans is going to have serious results. For one thing, medical costs are rising. The government is unable to pay the elderly people's medical bills that have gone up very much. Some old people have to leave hospital ""sicker and quicker"" than they should, before they are really better. More fortunate senior citizens, though, who still have good health, want new laws to be passed to allow them to stay at work. In the past, the retirement age was sixty-five, but that is changing now. Older people are stronger and more energetic than ever before. Many of them refuse to stop working just because they have reached a certain age. There is a change, too, in the way in which elderly people see themselves. _ are no longer happy to accept the gray hair, bald heads, and boring clothes of their own parents. They like to wear younger-looking clothes and bright makeup . American women spend millions of dollars a year on operations to lift their faces and make those ugly wrinkles disappear. Men are prepared to spend even more on operations to plant new hair on their bald spots. It's worth any money to look younger."	"[""the old age is seen as something that isn't admired""]"
When she was upstairs, the woman _ .	For some minutes, all was quiet in the street. Then from across the street someone came walking. It looked like a man of middle height, dressed in a big raincoat, a soft hat and rubber-soled boots or shoes, and making little sound while walking. No one was in sight. It was a street with two rows of about fifty small houses and there were three lamps on either side. The lamp nearest to the child's house could be seen clearly, but the others were almost hidden by the smoky air. A car passed the end of the street and its lights showed faintly,but clearly enough to show the smooth skin of a woman's face. The car disappeared as the woman, wrapped up in her coat, reached the doorway of the child's house. She put a key in the lock quickly, pushed the door open and stepped inside, then closed the door without looking round. She began to breathe hard. She leaned against the door for a moment, then straightened up as if with an effort, and walked towards the door of the front room, the passage leading to the kitchen, and the narrow staircase. She hesitated outside the door, then went up the stairs quickly but with hardly a sound. There was enough light from the narrow hall to show the four doors leading off a small landing . She pushed each door open in turn and shone a torch inside, and the light fell upon beds, walls, furniture, a bathroom hand-basin, a mirror which flashed brightness back; but this was not what the woman was looking for. She turned away and went downstairs, and hesitated again at the foot of the stairs, then turned towards the kitchen. Clearly there was nothing there, or in the small washroom that she wanted. Two rooms remained; the front room and a smaller one next to it. She opened the front room door. After a moment, she saw the child's bed and the child.	['opened four different doors']
It can be inferred from the passage that in the research _ .	"Fumbling with the buttons to find a good song while driving has been linked to increased risk of crashes, but is listening to music risky? ""It depends on the music,"" says a report published in the October issue of Accident Analysis & Prevention. The study found teenage drivers who played their own music had significantly more traffic violations compared with background music designed by the researchers to minimize driving distractions, or no music. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University in Israel recruited 85 drivers about 18 years old; just over half were male. The _ were each assigned to drive six challenging road trips that were about 40 minutes long, accompanied by an experienced driving instructor. Music was played on four trips, two with selections from the drivers' playlists, mostly fast-paced vocals, and two with background music, which was a mixture of easy listening, soft rock and light jazz designed to increase driver safety. No music was played on two trips. Subjects rated their mood after each trip and in-car data recorders analyzed driver behavior and errors. All 85 subjects committed at least three errors in one or more of the six trips; 27 received a warning and 17 required steering or braking by an instructor to prevent an accident. When the music was their own, 98% made errors; without the music, 92% made errors; and while listening to the safe-driving music, 77% made errors. Speeding, following too close, inappropriate lane use, one-handed driving and were the common violations. The male subjects were more aggressive drivers and made more serious errors than female subjects. The teens played their own music at a very loud volume but significantly decreased the sound level when listening to the safe-driving music, researchers said. Mood ratings were highest on trips with driver-preferred music."	['driver-preferred music increased the mood ratings']

But soon he was waken up again because a second person was knocking at the window.""Excuse me, what time is it now?""he asked. The driver looked at his watch again, and told him it was half past eight. In this way, the driver thought he couldn't have a good rest, so he wrote a short note and stuck it on the window for all to see. It said,""I don't know the time.""Again, he lay down in the seat for his sleep. A few minutes later,a third person came and began to knock at the window, ""Hey, sir.""he said, ""It's a quarter to nine."""	['twenty-five minutes later']
Which name is accepted in New Zealand?	"Strange Baby-Naming Laws Germany Parents are banned by law from using last names and the names of objects and products as first names.

Iceland The country's naming committee consults the National Register of Persons to determine if a name is acceptable. If parents want to go off-list, they must apply for approval and pay a fee, and the name must contain only letters in the Icelandic alphabet.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Rare birds in the UK have been living far better than the more common birds over the last decade due to the efforts of conservation organisations, according to a new assessment. The research shows almost 60% of the 63 rare birds that live in the UK have increased over the last 10 years. By contrast, only about one third of common species have increased over the same period. Just 28% of rare birds have decreased over the same period, compared with four out of every 10 common birds. The rare birds described in the assessment with increasing populations include theosprey andcorncrake . All of these birds are subject to conservation action. The declining common birds include the nightingale,swift , house sparrow and redgrouse . These are suffering declines for a variety of reasons, including changes in farming practices. Dr David Noble, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: ""That some of our rarer birds have responded to targeted conservation action is great news. It shows just what can be achieved. What we need to do now is to continue the good work and use some of the lessons we have learned to help our more common birds."" Dr Mark Avery, the conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said: ""Over the last decade we've enjoyed some great conservation successes, including removing some threatened species from the World Conservation Union's Red List of Thratened Animals and increasing the populations of red kite, osprey, etc. However, these successes arecountered by continued declines of some widespread species."" The overview of 210 native birds has been produced by a group of conservation organisations, to mark the publication ofThe State of the UK's Birdsreport, which is in its l0th year.

From the passage, we know that _ don't have mysterious power inside.	"We have known for a long time that flowers of different plants open and close at different time of day. Yet no one really understands why flowers open and close like this at particular times. It is not as simple as we might think, as new experiments have shown. In one experiment, flowers were kept in darkness. We might expect that the flowers, without any information about the time of the day, did not open as they usually do. In fact, they continued to open at their usual time. This shows that they have some mysterious way of knowing the time. Their sense of time does not depend on information from the outside world; it is, so to speak, inside them, a kind of ""inner clock"". This discovery may not seem to be very important. However, it was later found that not just plants but also animals including man have this ""inner clock""which controls working of their bodies and their activities. Human beings, then, are also controlled by this mysterious power. Whether we wish it or not, it affects such things in our life as our need for sleep, our need for food. And our ability to concentrate ."	['lifeless things']
What is implied about the ten young grey seals?	"Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the ""dinner bell"" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals."	['They were not born in the ocean.']

we can learn from the passage that_.	"I asked Jackie a lot of questions. I asked if she became close to her patients. She said, ""Some I do, especially if I have become their close friends and they tell me things they wouldn't tell anyone else.

What is the best title of this passage?	Besides entertainment and beautiful lanterns, another important part of the Lantern Festival, or Yuanxiao Festival is eating small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour. We call these balls Yuanxiao or Tangyuan. Obviously, they get the name from the festival itself. It is said that the custom of eating Yuanxiao originated during the Eastern Jin Dynasty in the fourth century, then became popular during the Tang and Song periods. The fillings inside the dumplings or Yuansiao are either sweet or salty. Sweet fillings are made of sugar, Walnuts, sesame , osmanthus flowers , rose petals, sweetened tangerine peel, bean paste, or jujube paste . A single ingredient or any combination can be used as the filling . The salty variety is filled with minced meat , vegetables or a mixture. The way to make Yuanxiao also varies between northern and southern China. The usual method followed in southern provinces is to shape the dough of rice flour into balls, make a hole, insert the filling, then close the hole and smooth out the dumpling by rolling it between your hands. In North China, sweet or nutmeat stuffing is the usual ingredient. The fillings are pressed into hardened cores, dipped lightly in water and rolled in a flat basket containing dry glutinous rice flour. A layer of the flour sticks to the filling, which is then again dipped in water and rolled a second time in the rice flour. And so it goes, like rolling a snowball, until the dumpling is the desired size. The custom of eating Yuanxiao dumplings remains. This tradition encourages both old and new stores to promote their Yuanxiao products. They all try their best to improve the taste and quality of the dumplings to attract more customers.	"[""China's traditional food--Yuanxiao.""]"

It can be inferred from the text that _ .	Parenting the adolescent does take a different approach than parenting younger kids. Looking back it seemed ly easy. They were born itty-bitty so you could take control - usually to keep them safe from harm, to teach right from wrong and begin to equip them with problem solving and relationship skills. But hey, remember when they were about two or three years old and they began to toddle off and test your limits? This was normal child development and you soon trusted that your child wouldn't touch the stove, muck about in the flowerpots or bite the cat. Adolescence is kind of similar in process to the two or three year old testing their limits. In adolescence though the test is more towards social limits: who they can go out with, when, where and for how long. Unlike the young child though, adolescence is nerve-wracking because now they are truly out of sight, the stakes are higher and your didn't raise your kid for 13 years plus to see them get into trouble now. Also unlike the young child, your teen is no longer itty-bitty and you can't simply tell them what to do. Parenting the adolescent requires extreme trust, patience and letting them take responsibility for decisions even when the consequences are not favorable. They do need to learn what the mantle of responsibility means during adolescence so that as adults they are suitably equipped to then carry on responsibly. No practice - no mastery. Taking responsibility takes practice and opportunity. Difficult as _ may seem, the parenting style has to shift from being the boss to being a consultant. Now, no one is saying here that there aren't any rules, but they are more flexible and more subject to negotiation. When you were the boss, you simply told your young child what to do and you expected them to follow your wishes. Now as a consultant you are more in an advisory position and must rely on the judgment of your teen to choose correctly.	['parents should provide opportunity for teens to practice taking responsibility.']
What would the son probably say after reading the words in the diary?	"An 80-year-old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45-year-old highly educated son.

The son said, ""Father, I have just now told you 'It's a crow'."" After a little while, the old father again asked his son the 3 time, ""What is this?"" At this time some expression of was felt in the son's tone when he said to his father. ""It's a crow, a crow, a crow."" A little after, the father again asked his son the 4 time, ""What is this?"" This time the son shouted at his father, ""Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times 'IT IS A CROW'. Are you not able to understand this?"" A little later the father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his son was born. On opening a page, he asked his son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary: ""Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. I did not at all feel irritated, I rather felt affection for my innocent child."""	['Nothing but felt rather ashamed.']
The energy preserved in the plants under stress conditions _ .	"Like people, plants experience stress. And also, like people, the response to that stress can determine success. Bad environmental conditions, such as drought, flood, heat and other stresses, affect yields more than crop pests and diseases. We are trying to find a way to equip plants with the ability to tolerate environmental stress and maintain high yields, said Stephen Howell, a professor of genetics and cell biology. Plant cells produce proteins and ship them to different parts of the cell. Under normal conditions, these proteins are folded into their normal, healthy structures as they are produced. When a plant is under stress, its cells produce poorly folded or unfolded proteins. Then a built-in system senses this and ""sets off an alarm in the cell,"" said Howell. In response to the alarm, another protein (IRE1) starts working and creates a different process which activates the stress response genes whose products bring about defensive measures that help the plant survive. ""As it turns out, responses that are activated under stress conditions actually inhibit the growth of plants,"" said Howell. ""This allows them to preserve their energy to survive the stress conditions."" For plants in the wild, this response is a help for survival, he said. In production of agriculture crops, however, this response reduces yields. ""You don't want crop plants to stop growing,"" Howell said. ""You want them to continue to grow and produce even though they are under stress."" With the new understanding of this stress response, the next step may be to silence the alarm system, said Howell. ""What may be important is to disable some of these stress responses. That may make the plant more productive under stress conditions."""	['helps the plants to survive']

Which is the most accurate form of biometrics?	"""Iris scan , please,"" the bank's computer voice tells you . You step up and the computer reads your eye , comparing it to the stored file it has of your iris. The images had better match--otherwise you won't be able to get your money. Iris scanning and other technologies , such as fingerprint and voice scanning , have appeared in many science fiction movies in the past. Today , these advanced technologies are part of the real world. They are common at work, the bank, the airport, and your local prison. The iris scan, fingerprint scan, and voice scan are all examples of biometrics a fast developing area of automatic personal identification technology . Basically , biometrics uses various ways to verify a persons identity , based on the individual's unique characteristics ,including fingerprints , voices, irises, body heat patterns, facial images, handprints , signatures and so on. Biometrics identification systems have a number of advantages over password systems. The primary advantage is that an individual has to be physically present in order to be identified. Another important advantage is that there are no passwords to remember , forget, lose or steal. The voice scan is the simplest and most affordable form of biometrics . It only requires a computer, a microphone and the correct software. The software records a subject's voice and then compares it to a stored voice sample for identification purposes. For additional safety, fingerprint and handprint scans can also be employed . Fingerprint scans take the image of a fingerprint and compare it to a stored file of prints. Handprint scans identify the unique features of a hand. Iris scans currently give the highest level of accuracy among all the available biometrics systems. Another technology , full facial scans , is currently in use at border crossings and airports. Facial scanning equipment can actually track and identify moving faces within a crowd. The potential of biometrics is exciting and encouraging . With continued development , testing , and application , current technologies will become even more effective in the future. Soon , the days of password and car keys will be gone . Just don't leave home without your fingerprints!"	['The iris scan']
Which is the best title of the passage?	"Who ""entertained us, challenged us and changed our world""? Absolutely, Jeremy Lin, an Asian-American NBA rising star, is one of those people. TIME Magazine named him one of 2012's Most Influential People in the World. Lin, 23, is not just a good basketball player, but also a graduate of Harvard University, one of the best universities in the world. ""Lin has broken the idea that one can't be a world-class player on the court and an excellent student off the court at the same time."" US Education Secretary Arne Duncan wrote in the TIME article about Lin. At 191cm, Lin isn't especially strong, compared with other point guards in the league. What makes Lin special from other players is his hard work and never-give-up spirit. ""I know how the league works. I may not get an opportunity , but I'm just going to put it all into this and see what happens."" Lin once said. He kept arriving early, leaving late, practicing hard and learning from other experienced players. Finally, when his opportunity came, he started to shine. ""He earned it."" Duncan said. ""He lives the right way, and he plays the right way. He works hard and stays modest. He sets a good example for young people today. """	['Hard Work Paid Off']
Why are more products and services created for teenagers?	"""Teenager"" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that ""kids are getting older younger"". With such maturity at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children."

What can we learn about the Zapps' car?	"For most families, a long car journey is the _ of any trip.But for the Zapps, their 83-year-old vehicle has been a home for the past 11 years, as the couple travel around the world on a never ending trip of a lifetime, covering 142,000 miles over four continents. Herman and Candelaria Zapp, who got married to each other in 1996 and to their journey in 2000, Set off from Patagonia, Argentina, heading for Alaska. They came back to Argentina in2004,but settled there only for a couple of weeks, before deciding the open road is the only way to live. They have been traveling ever since, with a trip around South America between 2005 and 2007, then central America, the U.S. and Canada until 2009.The car was shipped to Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea as they traveled those countries and they are currently in the Philippines on a tour of South East Asia. As a proof that life is possible in such a mobile style, the family of the two slowly grew to a number of six.They became, over the years and while on the road, parents to four children, Pampa (eight), Tehue (five), Paloma (three) and Wallaby (one). Remarkably, each of their kids has a different nationality. ""My grandfather knew that we wanted to travel and to never stop so he gave me the old Grdham-Paige car he used on his farm,"" Herman said. Each night the six Zapps either sleep in or around a tent set up next to their car, but more often than not they find a friendly local who will put them up for the night.The only hard rule the couple have to stick by, is the 40mph speed limit the 83-year old car is restricted to. Their trip is supported with the money coming from selling books they write about the places they visit."	['It can never run faster than 4Omph.']
What is the author's attitude toward sustainable development?	It is important for countries to develop. Sometimes development can do more harm than good for a country. Therefore, this development needs to be different from past development, which polluted the environment and wasted natural resources. One possible solution to this problem now being discussed is sustainable development. It focuses on preserving the environment and natural resources. It is all about creating better health care, education, housing and improved standard of living for everyone. This is a simple idea, but one that is hard to put into practice. However, it is something that we must do, because without sustainable development our future and the lives of our children and our grandchildren will be in danger. Nearly everything we do in our modern lives requires the use of the Earth's natural resources. These natural resources provide the energy for many important things. The list is almost endless. For all these things, we mostly depend on fuels such as coal, gas and oil to produce energy. We are now consuming these fuels at a much higher rate than they are being produced. On top of this, burning these fuels produces carbon dioxide, which is harmful to the environment. This is why many people are pushing for the use of alternative energy sources. Alternative energy sources can be used without running out. Some examples of the alternatives are solar energy, wind energy and hydroelectricity. As people are becoming more aware of the need to protect the environment, these types of energy are becoming more and more popular. In many parts of the world, tentative steps are being taken to introduce these forms of alternative energy. For example, some people in Nigeria are training to use solar power, and in Costa Rica, people are now using hydroelectricity to provide power for their small villages. The introduction of programmes like these will hopefully help end the systematic destruction of the environment and see alternative energy promoted around the world. This will mean good things for our future, our children's future and our grandchildren's future.	['Positive.']
What will the person say if he feels sorry for what he has said?	"People use their mouths for many things.They eat,talk,shout and sing.They smile and they kiss.In the English language,there are many expressions using the word ""mouth"". For example,if you say bad things about a person,the person might protest and say ""Do not bad mouth me."" Sometimes,people say something to a friend or family member that they later regret because it hurts that person.Or they tell the person something they were not supposed to tell.The speaker might say,""I really put my foot in my mouth this time."" If this should happen,the speaker might feel down in the mouth.In other words,he might feel sad for saying the wrong thing. Another situation is when someone falsely claims another person said something.The other person might protest,""I did not say that.Do not put words in my mouth."" Some people have lots of money because they were born into a very rich family.There is an expression for this,too.You might say such a person,""was born with a silver spoon in his mouth."" This rich person is the opposite of a person who lives from hand to mouth.This person is very poor and only has enough money for the most important things in life,like food. Parents might sometimes keep a child off sweet food as a form of punishment for saying bad things.For example,if a child says things she should not say to her parents,she might be described as a mouthy child.The parents might even tell the child to stop mouthing off. But enough of all this talk.I have been running my mouth long enough."	['I really put my foot in my mouth this time.']

You can most probably read the passage in _ .	Taking away a city's rubbish is a big job. Every day trucks come into a city to collect it. Most rubbish is made up of things we can't eat or use. If we kept these things we would soon have a mountain of rubbish. In some cities the rubbish is collected and taken outside of the city to a dump . Often the city dump is placed where the ground is low or there is a big hole. The kitchen rubbish is broken into small pieces and sent into the sewage system. The _ system takes away the used water from toilets, bathtubs and other places. To keep mice and flies away, some earth is used to cover the newly dumped rubbish. Later, grass may be planted on the rubbish-filled land. Finally, a house or a school may be built there, and then you'd never know that this had once been an old rubbish dump. In other cities the rubbish is burnt in special places. The fire burns everything but the metal. Sometimes the metal can be used again in factories where things are made of metal. The food parts of rubbish are put in special piles where they slowly change into something called humus , which looks like black earth. It is rich with kinds of things that feed plants and help make them grow.	['a science book']
Which of the following could be the best title of the story?	"On Christmas morning, I went to the Cockhedge Mall. People there were all busy buying their last minute requirements. I needed to buy a birthday card for my son-in-law whose birthday is the 29th of December. Picking up a few more things as well as my cared I went to join the line for the express checkout which was for people who only had a few items in a basket and not a trolley load. This line was next to the Customer Service desk. Seemingly waiting quite a long time, I was jogged out of my thoughts by a voice behind me making comments on the things I bought. It was so funny when I realized that she was describing the contents of my basket. The owner of the voice was a very pretty young lady. I said to her that I was going to buy a box of Christmas cookies but the only ones left were not to my liking. The lady told me that just opposite Cockhedge in Superdrug they had lots of cookies. I said, ""I'm not going to bother now. I had enough of shops and I'm going home."" The assistant from the Customer Service came across at this time saying ""If there is anyone in the line with a few items in their basket, none of which needed to be weighed, I will check out their groceries at the desk."" Because I had the sprouts which needed to be weighted, the young lady accepted the offer and walked away waving goodbye. Eventually my turn came at the checkout. I was walking away when I met my new friend once again who handed me a beautiful box of Christmas cookies. With a big hug she said ""Hope you have a lovely Christmas."" She had been into Superdrug to buy me the cookies while I was still queuing in Cockhedge. What a generosity to a stranger! I was so surprised you could have knocked me down with a feather. My Good Samaritan would never know what a joyful Christmas day I had with my family. Telling them this story, as we ate around the table, kept everyone _"	['A Surprise Christmas Gift']
According to Weyand, who made people surprised in the race?	"One of the strangest races in history is about to begin. The judge raises the starting gun and says,""On your marks, get set...'' BANG! Who will win this 40-yard race? Will it be the ostrich with its long legs? Or will it be the highly trained football player? Could the squirrel rush past them all? Don't worry. It's not a real race. Last week, Scientific American magazine asked professor Peter Weyand who would win an imaginary race between an ostrich, a football player, a pig, a squirrel, and an elephant. Weyand teaches physiology. He studies the way animals move. According to his knowledge of how animals _ , here's how the race might go: The ostrich runs out of the starting gate neck and neck with the football player in second, the gray squirrel running third, and the pretty pink pig in fourth. Forty yards later, at the finish line, the heavily feathered bird beats the speeding human! The competition isn't terribly close between the ostrich and the football player, but in a surprise move, the pig moves fast and manages to beat the squirrel by a nose. Pigs don't look like they're built for speed, so its third-place finish is a bit of a shock. How does Weyand explain the Animal Kingdom's speedy match? ""The easiest way to explain why the ostrich is fast is that it has long legs,'' he says. Most of the ostrich's leg muscles are high up on its short thighbones. Its long, light legs allow the bird to go faster and keep speed easily. When running, an ostrich's highest speed is about 35 mph. Elephants and squirrels actually run at the same pace. But because squirrels can accelerate quickly, the huge elephant would lose. Pigs can't speed up as fast as squirrels, but they can run faster. Pigs that live in the wild can run close to 16 mph, and squirrels can run at about 14 mph."	['The pig.']
The wide use of digital video recorders_.	"Interactive television advertising,which allows viewers to use their remote controls to click on advertisements, has been pushed for years. Nearly a decade ago it was predicted that viewers of ""Friends"", a popular situation comedy, would soon be able to purchase a sweater like Jennifer Aniston's with a few taps on their remote control. ""it's been the year of interactive television advertising for the last ten or twelve years,"" says Collin Dixon of a digital-media consultancy. So the news that Cablevision, an American cable company, was rolling out interactive advertisements to all its customers on October 6th was greeted with some skepticism. During commercials, an overlay will appear at the bottom of the screen, prompting viewers to press a button to request a free sample or order a catalogue. Cablevision hopes to allow customers to buy things with their remote controls early next year. Television advertising could do with a boost. Spending fell by 10% in the first half of the year. The popularization of digital video recorders has caused advertisers to worry that their commercials will be skipped. Some are turning to the Internet, which is cheaper and offers concrete measurements like click-through rates-especially important at a time when marketing budgets are tight. With the launch of interactive advertising, ""many of the dollars that went to the Internet will come back to the TV,"" says David Kline of Cablevision. Or so the industry hopes. In theory, interactive advertising can engage viewers in a way that 30-second spot or not. Unilever recently ran an interactive campaign for its Axe deodorant , which kept viewers engaged for more than three minutes on average. The amount spent on interactive advertising on television is still small. Magna, an advertising agency, reckons it will be worth about $138 million this year. That falls far short of the billions of dollars people once expected it to generate. But DirecTV, Comcast and Time Warner Cable have all invested in it. Yet there are doubts whether people watching television, a ""lean back"" medium, crave interaction. Click-through rates have been high so far (around3-4%, compared with less than 0.3% online), but that may be a result of the novelty. Interactive ads and viewers might not go well together."

When Sam won the second thing that he'd won in his life, he was _ .	Sam, an unemployed piano tuner, said it was only the second thing he had ever won in his life. The first thing was an Afghan blanket at a church raffle when he was 25 years old. But this was much bigger: it was $120,000! He had won the Big Cube, a state lottery game. To win, a contestant must first guess which number a spinning cube will stop on. The cube has six numbers on it: 1X, 10X, 50X, 100X, 500X, and 1000X. If he is correct, the contestant must then guess which of two selected variables is going to be greater. So, just guessing which number appears on the cube does not guarantee that you will win any money. Sam correctly guessed 1000X, but he still had to choose between two variables. One variable was the number of cars that would run the stop sign at Hill Street and Lake Avenue in six hours. The other variable was the number of times that a teenage boy would change TV channels in a three-hour period. This was a tough decision. Finally, Sam flipped a coin. It came up heads, so Sam picked the teenager. He picked right. The stop sign was run only 76 times, but the teen clicked 120 times. Sixty-year-old Sam jumped for joy, for he had just won 1000 times 120, or $120,000. Sam dreamily left the lottery studio. Talking excitedly on his cell phone while crossing the street, he got hit by a little sports car. Sam is slowly getting better. He was in the hospital for a month. His hospital bill was $110,000. And the insurance company for the little sports car's owner sued Sam for $9,000 worth of repairs. Also, Sam still has to pay federal taxes on his winnings. Sam doesn't play the state lottery any more. He says it's better to be unlucky.	['sixty years old']

Arthur Conan Doyle was remembered mainly for his_.	"What do literary greats Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Robert Burns have in common? They both lived and wrote in Edinburgh, along with many other big names in the field of literature.This fact helped UNESCO award the city the title of world's first City of Literature on October 14. Edinburgh left a lasting impression on Arthur Conan Doyle(1859-1930).Although he was born there he went to school in England but returned home for medical school.After graduating he moved to London and began writing his Sherlock Holmes stories.His inspiration for the character came from one of his professors at university.Holmes' methods were so clever that they actually furthered the advance of the study of criminology . Robert Burns(1759-1796)is still regarded as Scotland's national poet,more than 200 years after his death.He is celebrated all over the world through translations of his work and the annual Burns Night supper on his birthday.One of his songs,""My Love is Like a Red Red Rose"" ranks among the finest love songs ever written and ""Auld Lang Syne"" is sung all around the world. As one of the first literate societies in Europe,the Scottish Parliament passed the world's first compulsory education law in 1496.By the 1790s,almost all Scots could read.Visitors to Scotland often observed that even the lowest members of society had copies of Burns' poems and other books."

What would do harm to students who failed the college entrance examination?	Statistics show that every year, about 4 million students fail to pass the national college entrance exam. However, as China recently publicized students' scores for this year's college entrance exam, it seems that schools, parents and society at large give more attention to students who succeed in the exam, few people care about those who fail, the China Education Daily reported. Some students, after failing the exam, cannot get a timely support from their parents or teachers and begin to display some serious mental problems. How to help these students to get rid of the shadow on their mind has become a problem to be taken seriously. First, students' friends, parents and relatives should offer their sympathy and care to them in order to comfort their heart. At this time, parents should not blame students for their failure, otherwise they might bear more psychological burden. Secondly, teachers and the whole society should also offer more support to students who fail the exam. Lastly, students themselves should also try to overcome their depressions and adjust their mood. The newspaper urges the general public to offer their care, trust and support to these students. It also expects that students can face their failure bravely and try to start a new life happily.

Package holiday means	"Many people like traveling during their vacation. They go to mountains, seaside, or forests. Some people like history so they like to visit old castles , museums and monuments (, ). In many foreign countries, the travel agent can help you plan your holiday. You can tell the travel agent what kind of holiday you like, how much money you want to spend, and the travel agent will give you a lot of information about where to go, how to get there, where to stay, and what kind of activities you can do there. One of the holidays is called ""package holiday"". That is, you just pay the money, and the travel agent will plan everything for you, the ticket for the train or plane, the hotel, the activities, etc."	"[""you pay your money and you don't have to think about anything at all""]"
What are Katy Janda's words mainly about?	The behaviour of a building's users may be at least as important as its design when it comes to energy use, according to new research from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). The UK promises to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, part of which will be achieved by all new homes being zero-carbon by 2016. But this report shows that sustainable building design on its own -- though extremely important- is not enough to achieve such reductions: the behaviour of the people using the building has to change too. The study suggests that the ways that people use and live in their homes have been largely ignored by existing efforts to improve energy efficiency , _ instead focus on architectural and technological developments. 'Technology is going to assist but it is not going to do everything,'explains Katy Janda, a UKERC senior researcher,'consumption patterns of building users can defeat the most careful design. 'In other words,old habits die hard, even in the best-designed eco-home. Another part of the problem is information. Households and bill-payers don't have the knowledge they need to change their energy-use habits. Without specific information,it's hard to estimate the costs and benefits of making different choices. Feedback facilities, like smart meters and energy monitors,could help bridge this information gap by helping people see how changing their behaviour directly affects their energy use; some studies have shown that households can achieve up to 15 percent energy savings using smart meters. Social science research has added a further dimension ,suggesting that individuals'behaviour in the home can be personal and cannot be predicted whether people throw open their windows rather than turn down the thermostat , for example. Janda argues that education is the key. She calls for a focused programme to teach people about buildings and their own behaviour in them.	['The importance of changing building users, habits.']
We can probably read the article in _ .	"Celebrity endorsements Despite the fact that companies believe celebrities had a lot of pull with regard to the buying trends of consumers, researchers have discovered that this does not seem to be the case. British and Swiss researchers carried out a study showing that advertisements made by celebrities like David Beckham and Scarlett Johansson are not as effective as those by ordinary people. In a sample of 298 students, researchers presented a magazine advertisement for a digital camera that was endorsed (...) by a fictional student claiming the camera was ""hot"" and his ""preferred choice"". The same advertisement was shown to other students, but with a difference: The camera was endorsed by a famous person in Germany. While the students said that both advertisements were beneficial, the one made by the student topped the celebrity one if students aimed to impress others with their purchases . More than half of the students, who admitted purchasing products that would impress others, said they were influenced by the student's advertisement. Only 20% said the celebrity one would affect their buying decision. Professor Brett Martin of the University of Bath's School of Management, explained that the findings could be used not only in Germany, but in other countries as well. "" Our research questions whether celebrities are the best ways to sell products,"" said Prof Martin.""Celebrities can be effective but we found that many people were more convinced by an endorsement from a fictional fellow student. This is because many people feel a need to keep up with _ when they buy."""	['a local newspaper']
Elizabeth Blackwell spent most of her life in _ .	Elizabeth Blackwell was born in England in 1821, and moved to New York City when she was ten years old. One day she decided that she wanted to become a doctor. That was nearly impossible for a woman in the middle of the nineteenth century. After writing many letters asking for admission to medical schools, she was finally accepted by a doctor in Philadelphia. She was so determined that she taught school and gave music lessons to get money for the cost of schooling. In 1849, after graduation from medical school, she decided to further her education in Paris. She wanted to be a surgeon , but a serious eye problem forced her to give up the idea. Upon returning to the United States, she found it difficult to start her own practice because she was a woman. By 1857 Elizabeth and her sister, also a doctor, along with another woman doctor, managed to open a new hospital, the first for women and children. Besides being the first woman physician and founding her own hospital , she also set up the first medical school for women.	['the United States']
Why is China the fastest-growing auto market?	"China's auto production is expected to grow by 20 percent in 2005 to 6 million vehicles , possibly passing Germany as the world's No. 3 producer. China is the world's-fastest-growing auto market as rising incomes make it possible for millions to buy their cars. Foreign automakers are investing billions of dollars in expanding production in China. Germany produced 5.5 million vehicles in 2004, the No. 3 producer behind the United States and Japan. London is quickly becoming a major cycling city after the terrorist ( ) bombings on London's subway and bus system July 7, which killed 52 people. London Mayor Ken Livingstone wants to increase cycling 80% by 2010. ""Cycling is the fastest, cheapest, most healthy and environmentally friendly way to get around London, and more and more people are taking it up,"" Livingstone said. ""The number of cyclists has doubled over the last five years, while those killed or seriously injured has fallen by 40%."" Under the London Cycling Action Plan, Livingstone hopes to make London a world-class cycling city to reduce congestion and pollution. London now has 273 miles of bike roads, half built since 2000. The goal is 560 miles by 2010."	['Because Chinese are getting higher incomes.']
From Robert Feldman, we can learn that _ .	"Telling fewer lies benefits people physically and mentally. Anita Kelly, study author and professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, recruited 110 adults for her study. She divided them into two groups and asked one group to stop lying for 10 weeks. Lies included big ones and tiny ones--any false statement--but participants were still allowed to leave out the truth, keep secrets and avoid questions they didn't want to answer, etc. The other group wasn't given any special instructions about lying. It turns out that both groups reduced their lying, but those who were specifically told to tell the truth improved their health more. ""We found that the participants could purposefully and dramatically reduce their everyday lies, and that in turn was associated with significantly improved health,"" said Kelly. When participants in the no-lie group told three fewer white lies than they did in other weeks, they experienced, on average, fewer mental-health complaints and physical complaints. They were less likely to feel tense or sad and also experienced fewer sore throats and headaches. They also reported that personal relationships improved. Additionally, participants found themselves being honest about their daily accomplishments, and they stopped making up excuses for being late or failing to complete a task, for example. ""It's certainly a worthy goal to have people be more honest and interact with others in a more honest way,"" says psychologist Robert Feldman. ""That would be beneficial. I'm a little doubtful that it makes us all healthier, but it may make us healthier in a psychological way."""	['honesty is likely to help people become mentally healthier']
"""Police saw no reason to doubt that the man had been stuck in the car for a very long time."" implies that _ ."	"A Swedish man was dug out alive after being snowed in his car on a forest track for two months with no food, police and local media reported on Saturday. The 45-year-old from southern Sweden was found on Friday, February17, too weak to say more than a few words. He was found not far from the city of Umea in the north of Sweden by snowmobilers who thought they had come across a ruined car until they dug their way to a window and saw movement inside. The man, who was lying in the back seat in a sleeping bag, said he had been in the car since December 19. ""Just incredible that he's alive considering that he had no food, but also since it's been really cold for some time after Christmas."" a rescue team member told regional daily Vasterbottens- Kuriren, which broke the news. Ebbe Nyberg, duty officer at the Umea police, said police saw no reason to doubt that the man had been stuck in the car for a very long time. ""We would not make up something like this. The rescue services were on site too and saw the same as us."" he told Vasterbottens-Kuriren. Umea University Hospital, where the man is recovering after being rescued by police and a rescue team, said in a statement he was doing well considering the circumstances. Doctors at the hospital said humans would normally be able to survive for about four weeks without food. Besides eating snow, the man probably survived by going into a dormant-like state, physician Stefan Branth told Vasterbottens-Kuriren. ""A bit like a bear that hibernates. Humans can do that."" he said. ""He probably had a body temperature of around 31 degrees which the body adjusted to. Due to the low temperature, not much energy was used up."" ""Why the man ended up under the snow in the forest remains unknown,"" police said."	['police were sure of the fact']

Scientists from China go to Antarctica to _ .	"In the most southern part of our planet, there's a place that's covered with snow and ice all year round. But it has the clearest and cleanest air. Amazingly, in this place, the sun sometimes hangs even in the midnight sky. This place is Antarctica : the coldest, windiest and harshest place on the Earth. As the world's least-known place, Antarctica is of great interest to scientists around the world. In 1983, China joined the Antarctic Treaty (<<>> ). The treaty made Antarctica a peaceful place for member countries to do scientific research. During 30 years, China has sent many scientists to Antarctica. They mostly look at the resources under the icy land and do research about climate change and marine biology. Antarctica is a place with fantastic views. However, life there is very hard. Food is one of the biggest problems. Frozen food which can be heated easily is people's daily food. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, scientists often eat dried or canned vegetables. Sleep is also troublesome. In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this period, Antarctica points to the sun and receives sunlight 24 hours a day. In order to get some sleep, scientists cover the windows with black plastic cloth to create ""night"". Working in Antarctica is dangerous, especially when meeting gale-force winds.Sometimes the wind is even stronger than a typhoon.It can easily blow people away.So there are ropes that connect buildings of some research stations.People can hold these ropes to keep their balance in forceful winds. What's more, communicating with others is difficult. Without cables and Internet in some research stations, two-way radios are the only tools to communicate. If people want to say hello to friends and relatives, they can use satellite phones. Although it is challenging to work in Antarctica, scientists' _ to learn about this mysterious land will never end. It is hopeful that one day they will step every corner of this icy land."

How old was Deng when he died?	"Do you know the late leader of China, Deng Xiaoping? He was called the""chief architect of China's reform and opening-up "". August 22 is the 110 anniversary of his birth. President Xi Jinping held an important meeting for the event on August 20 , 2014 in Beijing. Senior leaders Li Keqiang, Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the event. Deng was born on Aug, 22, 1904 in the southwest China's Sichuan Province. He also had the name Deng Xiaosheng. His father , Deng Wenming , was a middle-level landowner . His mother died early in Deng's life. He has three brothers and three sisters. Deng's first wife , one of his schoolmates from Moscow , died when she was 24, a few days after giving birth to Deng's first child, a baby girl, who also died. His second wife left him in 1933. His third wife, Zhuo Lin, was the daughter of an industrialist in Yunnan Province. She married him in 1939 in Yan'an. They had five children:three daughters and two sons. Deng was sent to private primary school at the age of five. In the summer of 1919, Deng Xiaoping graduated from the Chongqing School. Then he went to study and work in France in the 1920s. His father strongly supported him, the night before going to France, Deng's father took his son aside and asked him what he hoped to learn there. He repeated the words he had learned from his teachers:""To learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China.""He joined the Communist Party of China in 1924. In late 1927 , Deng left Moscow to return to China. He joined the army to save China. He died on February 19 , 1997."	['Ninety-three years old']
According to the passage, _ .	"Old Fossils Scientists have found what they think is probably the oldest fossil on Earth, a remnant of life from 3.7 billion years ago when Earth's skies were orange and its oceans green. In a newly melted part of Greenland, Australian scientists found the leftover structure from a community of microbes that lived on an ancient seafloor. Based on their analysis of the fossils, the researchers determined that they are 220 million years older than those discovered in Western Australia, which were 3.48 billion years old. The discovery shows life may have formed quicker and more easily than once thought, about half a billion years after Earth formed. And that may also give hope for life forming elsewhere, such as Mars, said study co-author Martin VanKranendonk of the University of New South Wales and director of the Australian Center for Astrobiology. ""It gives us an idea how our planet evolved and how life gained a foothold,"" VanKranendonk said. Scientists had thought it would take at least half a billion years for life to form after the molten Earth started to cool a bit, but this shows it could have happened quicker, he said. That's because the newly found fossil is far too complex to have developed soon after the planet's first life forms, he said. In an outcrop of rocks that used to be covered with ice and snow which melted after an exceptionally warm spring, the Australian team found stromatolites , which are layered structures that are often produced by a community of microbes. The stromatolites were about 1 to 4 centimeters high. ""It is like the house left behind made by the microbes,"" VanKranendonk said. ""Scientists used the layers of ash from volcanoes and tiny zircon with uranium and estimated that they date back to 3.7 billion years ago."" The dating seems about right, said Abigail Allwood, a NASA astrobiologist who found the previous oldest fossil, from 3.48 billion years ago, in Australia. But Allwood said she is not completely convinced that what VanKranendonk's team found once was alive. She said the evidence wasn't conclusive enough that it was life and not a geologic quirk . ""It would be nice to have more evidence, but in these rocks that's a lot to ask,"" Allwood said in an email."	['the newly found fossils have a history of 3.7 billion years']
Which of the following sentence is Not true?	"I live with my grandmother in a Beijing yard house. One day last year, I was surprised to see a big foreigner coming out of the house next door to ours. He was very tall with short brown hair and a pair of glasses. The first time I saw him, I was too shy to speak to him. ""My English is too poor!"" I thought. My grandmother told me that he had just moved into our yard. ""I don't like it!"" she said. ""Foreigners aren't like us. Maybe he'll play loud music and parties every night! I'm sure he's going to cause trouble."" Several days later, I met the foreigner as I was walking home after work. ""Hello!"" he said (in Chinese!). ""My name's Tony.

Why do people prefer to visit Leavenworth?	Here are some interesting places in America: Lake Placid Lake Placid in New York State has everything you want: great downhill skiing , great golf courses, and ponds for swimming. It is also a beautiful village with shops, restaurants, and hotels. It is well-known as the place of the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics. While many travelers visit here for outdoor activities, others come to this beautiful town simply to get away from cities and enjoy the clean mountain air. Whether you come to Lake Placid for adventure or rest, you'll surely enjoy your stay here. Old Forge Located in New York State, Old Forge is a deeply-wooded town with many rivers and lakes. It is a place where many people come to spend their summers. Biking, boating, and skiing are all popular sports in Old Forge. And on rainy days, the town's small shops become the best places for people to look for special local gifts. If you are looking for a quiet place to keep away from trouble, Old Forge is a good choice. Leavenworth This comfortable mountain village is just a few hours' drive to the east of Seattle. Many people from Seattle and from the rest of the country come here to enjoy the local shops and delicious German food. Outside of Leavenworth, you will find some of the best views in Washington. High mountains rise from the wooded valleys and rivers run through the forests. There is no doubt that the environment is what makes Leavenworth such a special place for visitors.

According to the passage which of the following statements is NOT TRUE?	"The Happiest Cities On Earth If you're looking for a cheery destination for your next vacation, consider these four spots and get ready to take notes on how to really live the good life. Singapore With one of the highest population densities in the world and residents known for being workaholics, it's hard to imagine the city-state of Singapore having one of the happiest populations on earth. And yet in a recent survey, 95% of them said they were either very happy or quite happy. They give their city high marks for cleanliness and safety--subways are pristine and unfailingly arrive on time, and police are seen as helpful and good at their jobs. What's more, they feel they can count on their neighbours--all 5.1 million of them. Arhus, Denmark The residents of Arhus cheerfully part with 68% of their income in taxes, knowing that in return they will be guaranteed free healthcare, free daycare, and a top-notch education for their children. An energetic city of 300,000 with a lively cultural scene and a diverse number of religions represented, _ (the range in incomes is narrow), as well as easy access to the nearby sea and surrounding countryside, make Arhus seem more like a small town. San Luis Obispo, CA According to a 2008 Gallup-Healthways study, people who live in San Luis Obispo are more likely than residents of other U.S. cities to smile and experience joy and are less likely to experience pain or depression. About 64,000 of the 260,000 people in the greater metropolitan area , located halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, volunteer at over 11,000 non-profit organizations. Few journeys to work are longer than 10 minutes (one reason its members rank in the upper third for job satisfaction), so ""it's easy to be involved,"" resident Pierre Rademaker said. Business signs are unobtrusive by law, fewer than 11% of residents smoke--the lower rate in the U.S.--there are lots of bike lanes, and the city's plaza draws crowds of people for free concerts on summer Fridays. What's not to love? Monterrey, Mexico The people of Monterrey don't enjoy high household incomes or access to good healthcare. Instead, there's a profound sense of gratitude for the new political freedom enjoyed since the oppressive Institutional Revolutionary Party lost power in 2000--the first time in nearly a century--as well as an emphasis on social life over work. Another reason Monterrey residents may be so happy is their faith in God and family, and their ability to tough it out through bad times. ""We laugh at sickness, poverty and even death,"" says Basanez, a political scientist who lives in Monterrey. ""We even have a holiday to celebrate death. November 2, the Day of the Dead, is one of the biggest holidays of the year."""	['The residents in Singapore feel happy because of its low population density.']

A snail _ .	We've talked about snails and their slow move. But much of the time snails don't move at all. They are in their shells --sleeping. Hot sun will dry out a snail's body. So at the least sign of hot sun, a snail draws its body into his shell. A snail will die in a heavy rain. So when it rains, a snail does the same thing, too. A snail can sleep for as long as it needs to. It spends all the winter months in its shell, asleep. In the spring the snail wakes up. Its body, about three inches long, comes out from the shell. When hungry, the snail looks for food. Its eyes, at the end of the top feelers, are very weak. But its sense of smell is very strong. It helps the snail to find food and the new greens. A snail's mouth is no bigger than the point of a pin. Yet it has 256,000 teeth! The teeth are very small, and you can't see them. If you put a snail in a hard paper box, it will eat its way out! And if a snail wears out its teeth, it will grow new ones.	['sleeps much of the time']

Shen was asking his mother for a computer for a long time, but his mother didn't buy it for him. She said, ""We want him to use his card to save money for the computer. If we buy everything he asks for, he will think money comes too easily, and he won't work hard for it."" Today, there are many different kinds of bank cards. They are from different banks. People put their money in them. Then they can use their money at any time. People can do many things with bank cards. They can wash cars, go shopping, eat delicious food and travel to other places with the money in their bank cards. The most important thing is not ""How much did you get?""

It is known from the passage that Laura and Tanbay paid for their trips by _ .	To travel around the world is the dream of many adventurous people. But very few people can afford a global tour because hotels, food and airplane tickets are too expensive. Some people, however, have thought of some ways to realize their dreams. Laura Cody and Tanbay Theune, a couple from Britain, decided to travel around the world. They have found a good way to pay for their trips. They look after pets for rich house owners. In exchange, they can stay in the houses for free. They have looked after horses, cows, cats, dogs and fish. In two years, the couple has been to Australia, Germany, Spain and Italy. They have stayed in big cities and small villages. The home owners are usually very generous and have given them food, wine and day trips. Another person who tries to realize her travel dream is photographer Rhiannon Taylor. She travels around the world to visit, review and take photos of the best hotels. She shares the places she stays in and the food she eats on the Internet with tens of thousands of followers. With these ways of making money, traveling around the world is no longer a dream.

"What can you do when a British friend says "" Drop in any time""?"	"In Britain you may often hear ""Drop in any time"" or ""Come to see me soon"", but you can't really do that. People just say those things to make you feel welcome. It is better to telephone before visiting someone at home. If you receive a written invitation to an event that says ""RSVP"", you should reply to let the person who sent the invitation know whether or not you plan to go. You should never accept an invitation unless you really plan to go. You may refuse by saying ""Thank you for inviting me, but I will not be able to come. "" If, after accepting, you are unable to go, be sure to tell those who are expecting you as soon as possible that you will not be there. Although it is not necessarily expected that you give a gift to your host, it is considered polite to do so, especially if you have been invited for a meal. Flowers, chocolate, or a small gift are all appropriate. A thank-you note or telephone call after the visit is also considered polite and is an appropriate way to express your appreciation for the invitation."	['Telephone him or her before visiting.']
What did Diao Weihao feel when he realized what was happening?	"Diao Weihao, a student who studies business English at the Chengdu campus of Sichuan International Studies University, was in his dormitory when the earthquake struck at 2:30 pm on Monday. The 22-year-old felt that his chair was shaking. All of a sudden, the textbooks on the bookshelf began to fall to the floor. The glass in the window broke. ""It felt like our dormitory building was being hit by a tractor,"" recalled Diao. ""I wasn't afraid.. I was even excited and curious. Now, looking back, it was a scary experience."" Diao and his roommates kept their calm. They didn't try to get out of the building until the shaking stopped. They were on the fifth floor and they feared there might be trouble if they didn't remain calm. ""We've watched lots of disaster films, and that helped us keep cool,"" he said. ""Only one student sprained his ankle. He was escaping in a hurry. Most of us got outside quickly and safely."" They were surprised to see so many students outside. ""I began to realize then what had happened,"" he said. The college had warned them that in the event of an earthquake, they should leave the dormitory immediately. A few did rush in when it was safe to grab some clothes to keep warm. Without any tents or bedding, the students stayed on the football field for the whole night. Rain started falling in the morning, but the students all kept in good order. They simply chatted and shared their feelings and comforted each other. ""Our students seemed to have self-control,"" he said. ""I heard that hospitals in Chengdu have lots of injured people who jumped out of buildings."" Now, Diao is mostly worried about the people in Wenchuan County. ""It seems we won't be able to have classes in one or two day's time,"" said Diao. ""I want to become a volunteer at the damage-hit area, or donate my blood to the injured people in hospital. Also, I will write on my blog to keep people calm and encourage them to protect themselves during emergencies.""

However, they can eat in the canteen and get information about other parts of Sichuan by reading the newspapers."	['Calm']
We can infer that _ .	Everywhere I go, people are speaking on their cell telephones regardless of their surroundings . This happens when people are walking around a lake or through town, or even driving. I have even seen a person attempting to speak on her cell phone while ordering ice cream at Dairy Queen, thus speaking to two people at once. As the over-spending of technology increases, people begin to take less joy in the simple pleasures of life--joys that don't cost money--from observing clouds, playing with children to thinking or reading. And it is not just telephones that take the responsibility; too much value is placed on items from computers to cars. Many things are purchased merely to show off. Do you really need a cell phone that plays games, shows movies and takes pictures? No, cell phones should be purchased to use in urgent situations.You do not need to use your telephone when you are at someone else's house or in a restaurant. Technology and possessions do not bring joy. While some technology is necessary, it can get ridiculous . Each possession just makes us want more, while simple pleasures can be enjoyed now and then. Instead of spending our time buying a third television or looking into the newest cell phone models, we should be acting more productively to improve the world by volunteering, for example. Or, we should reconsider playing computer games or taking pictures on our cell phones and read a book or imagine what shapes the clouds are in the sky instead.

Sounds like some kind of film's plot? Not if you're a member of the Arapahoe teen rescue patrol in the suburbs of Denver. About 25 teen guys and girls are active members of this search, rescue and emergency organization, and they know firsthand that you don't have to be an adult to save lives. These 9th-through-12th graders are the real deal when it comes to emergency services. In fact, they're the only teen-commanded patrol in the nation. Sure they have adult advisers to turn to if necessary, but in the field it's a teen patrol officer calling the shots -- sometimes even giving direction to adults. Members are trained in rock-high-angle,swift-water and avalanche rescue , winter and alpine operation , wilderness life support and emergency care, among other skills. They also regularly ride along with the local fire and police departments, providing support such as security details and evidence searching. When asked what qualities make a good patrol member, founder and president Stan Bush named good physical conditioning and an interest in helping people. ""We put in lots and lots of hours helping people in trouble,"" he says. ""So if a person is not really interested in doing that kind of thing, he won't last as a member."""

Which is the best title for the passage?	"Charles Plumb was a US Navy jet fighter pilot in Viet Nam. After 75 missions, his plane was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile. Plumb parachuted down into enemy hands. He was captured and spent 6 years in a communist Vietnamese prison. One day, Plumb and his wife were sitting in a restaurant when a man from another table came up and said ""You're Plumb! You flew jet fighters in Viet Nam from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. You were shot down!"" ""How in the world did you know that?"" asked Plumb. ""I packed your parachute,"" the man replied. ""I guess it worked"". Plumb assured him, ""It sure did. If your chute hadn't worked, I wouldn't be here today."" Plumb couldn't sleep that night, thinking about that man. Plumb says, ""I kept wondering what he looked like in a Navy uniform: a white hat, a bib in the back, and bell-bottom trousers. I wonder how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning. How are you?' or anything because, you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was 'just a sailor'"". Plumb thought of the many hours the sailor had spent at a long wooden table in the bowels of the ship, carefully weaving the shrouds and folding the silks of each chute, holding in his hands each time the fate of someone he didn't know. Sometimes in the daily challenges that life gives us, we miss what is really important. We may fail to say hello, please, thank you, congratulate someone on something wonderful that has happened to them, give a compliment, or just do something nice for no reason. As you go through this week, this month, this year, recognize people who pack your parachutes."	['Who pack your parachutes?']
This passage is probably taken from _ .	"An out-of-body experience? It's just your brain playing tricks on you. Some report feeling as if they are floating above their own bodies, while others find themselves drawn towards a blinding light. But out-of-body experiences are nothing more than a trick of the mind, scientists claim. They say that common spooky scenarios, such as floating above a hospital bed or walking towards the light at the end of a tunnel, can be explained by the brain trying to make sense of the process of death. Scientists from the universities of Edinburgh and Cambridge reviewed studies into changes in the brain that cause certain strong feelings associated with near-death experiences. Researcher Caroline Watt said one common vision -- that of people seeing a bright light which seems to be drawing them into the afterlife -- is probably produced by the death of the cells we use to process the light picked up by our eyes and turn it into pictures. ""It is simply your brain trying to make sense of the unusual experiences you are having,"" Dr Watt said. Feelings of being out of the body can also be explained by the brain's behavior, the journal Trends in Cognitive Science reports. ""If you put on a virtual reality headset showing an image of yourself three feet in front, you can trick your brain into thinking that is you over there, and get the sense you are outside your body,"" Dr Watt added. The scientific evidence suggests that all aspects of the near-death experience have a biological basis. In another example, the hormone noradrenalin, which is released when we suffer from stress and injuries, could be behind the feelings of love and peace that many experience when they seem to be approaching death. However, other scientists say we should not be so quick to dismiss (stop considering) people's accounts (descriptions). Sam Parnia, of the University of Southampton, stressed that being able to trace something back to the brain does not mean it is not real. Dr Parnia, who is close to completing a three-year study of hospital patients' recollections of their near-death experiences, said, ""Every experience, whether near-death or otherwise -- such as depression, happiness and love -- is mediated by the brain."""

How many toes did a horse have millions of years ago?	Have you ever seen a horse with toes ?Millions of years ago, horses had many toes. They had four toes on each front foot. They had three toes on each back foot. The horses were no bigger than the cats.These small horses lived in the forest. The toes helped the horses run on the soft, wet ground. At first, it was very hot in the forest. But the weather changed. It became very cold. Many trees could not live in cold weather. The trees died and fell. Open fields took the place of forests. The sun made the ground dry and hard. Horsed began to change, too. They began to get bigger. This took a long time. On the dry, hard land, horses needed only their middle toes for running. Their middle toes became hard. After a long time, horses had only one hard toe on each foot. Now we call this hard toe a	['14']
What did the group of old classmates get together for?	"A group of old classmates, who have succeeded in their work, got together to visit their old university professor. The conversation soon turned to complaining about the stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many cups-china , plastic and glass, some plain looking, some expensive and some lovely. The professor told them to help themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said, ""Can you notice all the nice looking expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones? While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress."" ""What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups."" ""Now think about this: life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life, and do not change the quality of life. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cups, we fail to enjoy the coffee. So don't let the cups drive you, enjoy the coffee instead."""	['Visiting their old university professor.']
Ralph brought his child to Becky because _ .	"Our three-year-old daughter Becky wanted a dog. But we were too busy to buy one. One day, Becky ran in, shouting, ""Mom! Come to see my dog!""

At night, Ralph would return to the mountains. Sometimes he disappeared but came back several days later. On Becky's first day of school, we could see Ralph's sadness. After Becky left school, Ralph lay by the side of the road and waited. When Becky returned, he got happy again. This continued throughout Becky's school years. Twelve years passed. One day we heard that a wolf was killed. The other wolf was hurt and ran away. We were worried about Ralph. That night, Ralph returned with a wound. Becky held his head kindly and comforted him. We hoped he could come through. However, he died. Becky cried. I noticed something strange in the bush--two little yellow eyes! Ralph's child! Before he died, Ralph brought his child to us! He knew he would be safe here, as he had been. Ralph, Ralph, I was moved. ""Don't be afraid, little...little Ralphie. That's Mom. She loves you, too."""

We can infer from the text that some prisoners _ .	"I have been teaching animal behavior at the Boulder County Prison in Colorado for 10 years. The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own ""animal behavior"" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher."	['have turned over a new leaf']

It measures the early baby's heart sounds to help test the heart rate, age and position of the baby in the mother. The device is similar in operation to an ultrasound test, but is far less costly and very practical in Africa. This is the third year for the Social Innovation Summit.

How many times did the student go to the lake?	"One day a famous teacher was walking with his student. On the way, they saw a lake. They stopped and the teacher told the student, ""I'm thirsty.

He came back and told the teacher, ""The water is very dirty. We can't drink it."" After about half an hour, the teacher asked the student to get some water again. So he went back to the lake. But the lake was still dirty. So he told the teacher the same thing. After some time, the teacher asked him to go back again. But this time, he found the water was clear. The mud in the water came to the bottom. So he got some water. The teacher looked at the water and said to him, ""You did nothing to make the water clear. You just let it be. Your mind is also like that! When it is bothered , just let it be. Give it some time."""	['Three times.']
In the author's eyes, Sandra Bullock _ .	"Sandra Bullock turned 51 last month. But because she looks exactly the same as she did inMiss Congeniality, a movie filmed back in the 20thcentury, everyone calls her ""ageless."" Bullock is just one of a number of stars in their 40s and 50s who've had birthdays recently but have not gotten older, unlike the rest of us in their age group. Take Halle Berry. One website put a photo of her 20 years ago next to one of the newly 49-year-old Berry and dared us to choose which was which. ""This Is What 49 Looks Like,"" it said. Seriously, if that's what 49 looks like, I must be 71. However, even a generation ago, famous faces evolved. Look at a picture of Grace Kelly at age 52 in the early 1980s. She looks like a beautiful middle-aged woman. Today she'd look old for her age. The goal now is to prevent aging while you are still young, using all the magical nonsurgical options medicine has to offer. Eventually these techniques will become less expensive, and ordinary people my daughter's age will have them. Already anti-aging is starting to be considered maintenance, like coloring your hair. My friends and I find ourselves openly debating techniques that we used to make fun of. Does fat-freezing work? How much time do you have to spend in the gym to keep the body of a 35-year-old after 50? It's all so exhausting. But members of the next generation have it tougher. They'll have to ask themselves whether they want to spend their youth trying not to get old. I've already seen ""Sexy at 70"" headlines. Will everyone be expected to go to their graves looking hot? I also have to wonder what else we are slowing along with age. How do you move on if you're working so hard to stay the same? And besides, if you've known the ache of watching a daughter pack up for college, you know you can't stop the clock."	"[""doesn't look her age at all""]"
The bristles function as something _ .	Scientists have long had it in their mind to make a robot lizard . They began with finding out why a lizard can hang on a wall. They noticed the lizard's toes were unique: They have suckers , which enable it to hang on walls. They, therefore, made a robot with suckers on its hands and feet. The robot could hang on the wall but fell off when crawling. So, they went on researching. 6 years ago, scientists discovered that suckers only were not enough. It is the bristles on each foot that adds friction and static adsorption that makes a lizard move on the smooth wall easily without falling down. Then scientists made great efforts to fix thick bristles to the robot's hands and feet. However, the effect was not satisfactory. The robot still couldn't attach itself firmly to the wall. Scientists got puzzled: How on earth can the lizard crawl on an extremely smooth wall or even on a ceiling without dropping off? An accidental finding inspired them: One day a scientist happened to see an animal attack a lizard and bite off its tail. The lizard broke away from the animal's teeth and threw itself on a wall to escape, only to fall off heavily on the ground. The scientist wondered: Is it the tail that plays an important role in its travelling on the wall? He caught some lizards for an experiment. The result proved his assumption: A tailless lizard has no trouble walking on an ordinary wall but can't on a smooth one. A further study showed the lizard's tail can prevent it falling over backward and, what's more, that the tail acts as an additional leg while one of the lizard's legs leaves the wall, which is always the case while it is walking on the wall. Thus, Tailbot, a super tailed robot, is born.	['to produce friction and static adsorption']

Indian elephants are getting increasingly angry and they revenge because _ .	"The elephant was lying heavily on its side, fast asleep. A few dogs started barking at it. The elephant woke up in a terrible anger: it chased the dogs into the village where they ran for safety. That didn't stop the elephant. It destroyed a dozen houses and injured several people. The villagers were scared and angry. Then someone suggested calling Parbati, the elephant princess. Parbati Barua's father was a hunter of tigers and an elephant tamer . He taught Parbati to ride an elephant before she could even walk. He also taught her the dangerous art of the elephant round-up -- how to catch wild elephants. Parbati hasn't always lived in the jungle. After a happy childhood hunting with her father, she was sent to boarding school in the city. But Parbati never got used to being there and many years later she went back to her old life. ""Life in the city is too dull. Catching elephants is an adventure and the excitement lasts for days after the chase,"" she says. But Parbati doesn't catch elephants just for fun. ""My work,"" she says, ""is to rescue man from the elephants, and to keep the elephants safe from man."" And this is exactly what Parbati has been doing for many years. Increasingly, the Indian elephant is angry: for many years, illegal hunters have attacked it and its home in the jungle has been reduced to small pieces of land. It is now fighting back. Whenever wild elephants enter a tea garden or a village, Parbati is called to guide the animals back to the jungle before they can kill. The work of an elephant tamer also involves love and devotion. A good elephant tamer will spend hours a day singing love songs to a newly captured elephant. ""Eventually they grow to love their tamers and never forget them. They are also more loyal than humans,"" she said, as she climbed up one of her elephants and sat on the giant, happy animal. An elephant princess indeed!"

Before the development of BASIC, _ .	"As a teenager in 1972, Bill Gates boasted that he would be a millionaire by the time he was 20. While he did not quite achieve that goal, only 15 years later, he was a millionaire. And by 1992, as head of the Microsoft company, he became the richest man in America with assets of nearly US $ 6.3 billion. Born in Seattle, Washington on 28, October, 1956, Gates was named William Henry after his father and grandfather. From the beginning, he was an extremely energetic and intelligent child. He had read the entire world book encyclopedia by the age of nine. His favorite subjects at school were science and math and his favorite pastime was ""thinking"". Gates first started to play with computers at the age of 13. Before long he became an expert at working the school's computer. After his graduation from secondary school, Gates was accepted by the three top universities in the USA-Princeton, Harvard and Yale. He chose Harvard and began classes there the next autunm, majoring maths. But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls. By 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC. This was not the first program ever created, but its inventors were the first to decide that people who wanted to use it should pay for it. BASIC was a success because until it came along, there had been no efficient way of getting computers to carry out instructions. Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft. His next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980. Today it is the operating system used in more than 14 million personal computers around the world. As chief executive officer of Microsoft, Gates is known as a bright man, but one who is not easily satisfied. He is quick to criticize his staff and hates to be questioned about decisions he has made. He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut until his marriage to Microsoft manager Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994. Yet to many people now, Gates, is a person who is, in spite of his great wealth, humble and ordinary. He spends his money carefully. He eats in fast food restaurants and flies economy class. And when praised for Microsoft's great success, he has been heard to say, ""All we do is put software in a box and if people see it in the stores and like it, they buy it."""

What is the text mainly about?	"Every few years comes a fitness trend that has people scratching their heads in amazement. ""Crunning"" will probably be one of them. The ""c"" stands for ""crawling"" . This new sport needs two-legged humans running on all fours! The funny idea is the brainchild of Shaun McCarthy. The 34-year-old is convinced that it will revolutionize fitness as we know it. According to the sports enthusiast, ""The only thing that crunning's changed about fitness is that it's changed everything about fitness."" Mccarthy has no scientific evidence to prove that crunning is more efficient than traditional two-legged running. However, he believes it is a more effective way to exercise because it puts an emphasis on the shoulders and arms, providing a complete body workout. Mccarthy also says crunning seems to tire him out more. He therefore concludes that the unconventional exercise is a bigger calorie burner than normal running. While experts generally agree that crunning may provide a better workout, many are not sure if it is the right exercise for humans. Fitness coach Kevin Dean says we are not built to be on all fours and our wrists are therefore not as strong as our ankles. He believes crunning, which he calls a fad , could result in bad wrist and shoulder injuries, not to mention broken noses. But McCarthy is not worried. Since the release of his crunning video a few weeks ago, many Melbourne residents have been seen scampering around on all fours. As it turns out they are not the only ones. In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, crawling, a much slower version of crunning, has been a favorite activity for many years. According to some enthusiasts, the light exercise that is believed to date back two thousand years to the Han Dynasty, is good for curing back and spine ailments. Ready to give crunning try? Then Mccarthy recommends investing in some good shoes, hardy gloves and most important of all, a face mask!"	['A new trend of exercising.']
From the passage, we can infer _ .	In America, parents tend to encourage their children to develop their potential to the fullest extent. Fathers and mothers frequently teach their children both ambition and the confidence necessary to work toward their goals. American parents are always active in concentrating on what their kids can do, not what they can't. As a result, millions of American boys and girls grow up hoping to become actors and athletes, diplomats and doctors. Many of them even want to become president. American parents often encourage their children to become involved in extra activities of all types at school, such as student government, sports and music. They believe that only through taking part in these activities can their children become mature young adults. As we all know, schoolwork is important. But parents should realize that the social skills their children learn form natural conversations with each other are as important as schoolwork and the skills they will need in the future work. What's more important in their work is that their children should have a sound knowledge of physics or the ability to communicate effectively. As a rule, Chinese parents don't educate their children about the same kind of ambition and confidence as Americans do, nor do they encourage the same level of participation in extra activities. Children are typically advised to study hard and pass exams. They have to spend a lot of time in doing much schoolwork every day. It is a great waste of time to do so. Now more and more Chinese parents have recognized that they should pay attention to developing the potential of their children. I hope that leaders in Chinese educational circles should take some measures to develop the potential of their children. I am very confident about it.

How was the king feeling when he saw second wall?	"There lived a king who liked art. One day an artist offered to paint the most beautiful picture in the world on the wall of his palace.

The following day a thick curtain was put into place and both the artists got to work. The first artist brought in a regular supply of paint, oil and water. But the second one would come with a cloth and a bucket of water every day. A month later the first artist said that his work was completed and invited the king to come. So the king sent the message to the second artist, saying he was coming to see their works that evening. After seeing the first artist's wall, the king was very impressed with the painting and gave him a huge sum of money as a reward. He then asked for the curtain to be opened up. The same painting was seen on the opposite wall too! It was exactly like the one on the first wall. But this man had not seen what was going on, on the other side of the curtain. The man said simply, ""It's very easy I just polished the wall every day!"" It was a wall made of white marble. The fellow polished it till it shone like a mirror. The reflection of the painting across the room showed up in it!"	['Satisfied and curious.']
A child is not permitted to continue in a TV show _ .	"Many children act in TV shows. They work several hours every day, so they cannot go to a regular school. How do they get an education? In Hollywood, where many TV shows are made, about forty teachers give lessons for the children in the shows. They teach wherever their pupils are working. They teacher's job is very important. She is responsible for making sure that the child works only the permitted hours each week. She is also responsible for making sure that the child learns the required subjects. She makes sure, too, that the child gets enough rest and play, along with his education. Child actors are required to attend classes twenty hours each week. California law says that they must be taught from September to the middle of June. If they do not get good marks in school, they are not permitted to continue working in TV shows. TV children are usually good pupils, and most of their teachers like this special kind of work. Their classes are held in many interesting places. Sometimes the""classroom""is a Mississippi riverboat. Sometimes it is the inside of a spaceship. Often the pupils become famous stars."	['if his teacher says that his school work is unsatisfactory']
The quickest and cheapest way for people to send message to their friends is _ .	Perhaps you have heard a lot about the Internet, but what is it? The Internet is many different networks around the world. A network is a group of computers put together. These networks joined together are called the Internet. Maybe that doesn't sound interesting. But when we've joined the Internet. There are lots of things we can do. We can have a lot of interest on the World Wide Web (www). We can use the internet instead of a library to find all kinds of information for our homework.. We can find information about our favorite sports or film stars and do shopping on the Internet. We can also send messages to other people by e-mail. It is much cheaper and quicker than calling our friends or sending letters. Thanks to the Internet, the world is becoming smaller and smaller. People can now work at home with a computer in front, getting and sending the information they need. They can buy or sell whatever they want by the Internet. But do you know 98%of the information is English? So what will English be like tomorrow?	['by e-mail']

"GWANGJU, South Korea, Sept. 28,2013 (Xinhua) -- Cultural ministers from China, Japan and South Korea participating in the 5th China-Japan-South Korea Ministerial Conference on Culture held here Saturday agreed to strengthen cultural exchange and cooperation to promote the cultural prosperity of East Asia. Cai Wu, China's Minister of Culture, Hakubun Shimomura, Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, and Yoo Jinryong, Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Korea attended the meeting in the South Korean city with more than 2,000 years of history. At the meeting, Cai said that the east and west differ in history, culture and values, but the East Asia as a whole, especially China, Japan and South Korea, should take good advantage of their cultural and historical similarities, trying to create ""shared East Asia value""and _ around the world. The ministers drew the Gwangju Joint Document at the meeting to strengthen cultural exchange and cooperation in the fields of culture industry, exhibitions, cultural heritage preservation and the youth exchanges to promote the program of ""East Asia City of Culture."" China, Japan and South Korea also agreed that the host country of the annual ministerial meeting will organize a joint cultural festival, including art performances, exhibitions, academic seminars and other relevant events starting from 2014.

Mum Nevenka Loknar was surprised that the bear _ .	"Animal experts in Croatia say a bear has learned how to trick people to let him in by knocking at the door. They believe the 220- kilogram brown bear probably learned the trick while nudging a door to get it to open. Experts have a guess that the nudging was mistaken by the owners for knocking and that the bear, pleased by the result, repeated the trick. The Loknar family from Gerovo in western Croatia said the bear had knocked at their door three times and they were now refusing to answer the door. ''We jumped out of the window as he came in through the door and went into the kitchen to take some food for the first time."" Mum Nevenka Loknar told a reporter from a local newspaper. ""I opened the door and saw him standing there and I didn't believe my eyes at first, then I ran for it as he walked in as if _ was the most normal- thing in the world."" Bears are a common thing in the woods around here, but no one has ever heard of a bear that knocks at the door. Mum Nevenka Loknar said, ""The bear is so intelligent. It's incredible. We've tried to put up lots of obstacles to stop him coming in, like a wire fence but he still gets through. I wouldn't be surprised if he knew how to use wire cutters."""

About 40% passwords are easily stolen because the users are _ .	"Better think twice before choosing a _ for email, online bank or shopping. Simple passwords are easy to be stolen. A password is like a key to your home. If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as ""12345678""or ""QWERTY"". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like ""I don't care"", ""Whatever"", ""I love you"" or their opposite, ""I hate you"". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol. Of course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the perfect password is easy for you and hard for others. ,,."

What can we learn from this passage?	Kuala Lumpur is an exciting capital city in Malaysia. Here are the top 4 budget hotels there: The Chinatown Inn (About $30 per night) Just a block from the railway station, located in Chinatown's open market. It has clean beds, central air conditioning, hot water for coffee and tea, and a hall with a big screen TV. Wi-Fi is good on the first 4 floors, but a little weak on Floor 5. Many guests like the Chinatown Inn. Their complaint is that the air condition is too cold, so make sure you get a room with a window. You can open it to let some warmth in. Ancasa Express (About $45 per night). The hotel is above the sky-train station. That makes it convenient to get to other parts of the city. From the station, take the elevator to the 5th floor to reach the hotel lobby . The rooms are clean and nice. There is a flat screen TV, the strongest Wi-Fi, and a very hot rainfall shower. The guests' complaint is that the cafe is only open for breakfast and dinner, and not 24 hours. Central Hotel (About $35 per night) This hotel is just two blocks from the Central Station, which is the heart of all transportation in the city--buses, trains and sky-trains all meet here. Central is where the airport-link trains will take you to the airport. From Central you can walk 2 blocks to the beautiful Central Hotel, in which rooms are small but nice and clean, and have common Wi-Fi. Ocean 77 (About $25 per night) On Petaling Street in Chinatown, this brand new hotel is most spotlessly clean. There is a flat screen TV and good Wi-Fi in each room. The location is good, in the heart of the Petaling Street market. No cafe in the hotel, but many nearby on the street.	['Only one of the four hotels is air-conditioned.']
Who are likely to go to sleep later according to the text?	Experts recently suggested that teens should start adopting early bedtimes. Before you dismiss it as a habit suited only for young kids, consider that there are serious advantages in being well-rested. And now, even more research suggests that putting phones away before going to sleep is important to teens' well-being. A new study from Seton Hall University School of Health and Medicine Science found that 62 percent of kids used their smart phones before bed, and it's causing less sleep and poor performance in school. Those teens who text before bedtime tend to go to sleep later, and get up later in the morning. Such behavior can be associated with mental health issues like depression or anxiety. Besides, once teens do receive a text, experts found, they tend to respond right away. Then the text conversation continues -- resulting in an even later bedtime. The study's co-author Dr. Peter Polos says this leads to excessive stimulation at night. Light from electronic devices can block the secretion of melatonin -- a hormone that promotes sleep, which makes sleep difficult in the face of overuse of smart phones at night. It's true! More screen time means less sleep time; other studies have suggested the same idea. As for a final piece of advice, Dr. Sushanth Bhat says, since getting the proper amount of sleep is very important for brain development and learning in the teenage years, our study should encourage parents and guardians to limit adolescent smart phone usage at night. Keep in mind that teens aren't the only ones addicted to their phones! Adults can also benefit from setting a tech curfew for themselves. After all, kids learn by example!

The purpose of the divers' journey to the deepest point on the earth was to find _ .	"The journey two divers made some time ago to the deepest point on the earth makes us realize how much of the world still remains to be studied. The two men went down seven miles to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean inside a small steel ball to find out if there are any ocean currents or signs of life. It was necessary to set out early, so that the ball would come to the surface in daylight, and be easily found by the mother ship which would be waiting for it. The divers began preparations early in the morning and soon afterwards, when all was ready, the steel ball disappeared under the surface of the water. The divers felt as if they were going down steps as they passed through warm and cold layers of water. In time the temperature dropped to the freezing point. They kept in touch with the mother ship by telephone telling how they felt. Then, at a depth of 3,000 feet, the telephone stopped working and they were quite cut off from the outside world. All went well until some four hours later at 30,000 feet, the men were frightened by a loud, cracking noise. Even the smallest hole in the ball would have meant instant death. Luckily, though, it was only one of the outer windows that had broken. Soon afterwards, the ball touched the soft ocean floor raising a big cloud of ""dust"" made up of small dead sea creatures. Here, powerful lights lit up the dark water and the men were surprised to see fish swimming just above them quite untroubled by the great water pressure. But they did not dare to leave the lights on for long, as the heat from them made the water boil. Quite unexpectedly, the telephone began working again and the faint but clear voices of the divers were heard on the mother ship seven miles away. After a stay of thirty minutes the men began their journey up, arriving three hours later, cold and wet through, but none was worse for their experience."

According to Paragraph 1, John thought that _ .	"John and Bobby joined the same company together just after graduation from college the same year. Both worked very hard. After several years, however, the boss promoted Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary worker. John couldn't it anymore, gave his resignation to the boss and complained that the boss only promoted those who only said good words to him. The boss knew John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, ""I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave."" John agreed. The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling water melons. The boss asked how much they per kilo. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kilo. The boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office. He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. Bobby went, returned and said, ""Boss, only one person is selling watermelons. $1.2 per kg, and $10 for 10 kg. He has 340 melons in all, 58 of which are on the table. Every melon weighs about 2 kg. Brought from the South two days ago, they are fresh and red. "" John was impressed and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to resign but to learn from Bobby."	['it was unfair that the boss only promoted Bobby.']
The major point discussed in the passage is _ .	"There is a common belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have taught in has ever considered spelling unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, quite different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is, how to encourage a child to express himself freely in writing without holding him back with spelling. If spelling becomes the only point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to "" _ "". He will write only words within his spelling range . That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience:""This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling mistakes."" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupils technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad thing for the teacher who had omitted to read the composition, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the mistakes, but if his priority had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more hope to seek improvement."

Why is the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System being built in the desert?	"The world's largest solar thermal plant is set to begin producing power in the United States by the end of the year. Wind and energy from the sun are generally considered clean, unlike energy from coal-burning power stations. However, environmentalists now worry that too much solar power development could harm the local environment. A California company -- BrightSource Energy is building a huge solar power plant in the Mojave desert, about 60 kilometers southwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The plant is known as the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System. Joe Desmond works for the company. ""This is actually one of the highest concentrations of sunlight in the world, out here in Ivanpah."" explained Desmond. BrightSource Energy will deploy 170,000 specially designed mirrors to direct solar energy towards boilers on top of three power towers. The steam produced in the boilers will drive turbine to make electricity. Joe Desmond says the steam can reach temperatures of more than 260 degrees Celsius. ""We can store the sun's thermal energy in the form of molten salt, so we can produce electricity even when the sun goes down. There is a lot of interest in concentrating solar power around the globe in environmnents where you have lots of sun, such as China, South Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, explained Desmond. Environmentalists generally support the idea of solar power, however, many are concerned about the effect of power plants on sensitive environment. Lisa Belenky is a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity, a private group. She says environmentalists are specifically worried about the effect of the Ivanpah Solar Project on the sensitive plant and animal life in that part of Mojave desert. ""Even though the desert seems big, when you start cutting it up, it can really affect how the species and the animals and the plants are able to survive in the long run,""said Lisa Belenky. BrightSource Energy has already spent more than $ 50 million to move endangered desert tortoises away from the power plant. but Lisa Belenky says this is not the answer. ""We should be reusing areas that have a1ready been disturbed, like old mining sites, for example...either on homes, on businesses, parking lots."" said Belenky. There have also been reports of birds dying at the Ivanpah Plant and others like it. Some birds die after colliding with solar equipment which the animals mistake for water. Other birds were killed or suffered burns after flying through the intense heat at the solar thermal plant. As solar projects increase, environmentalists and developers are considering what to do to reduce bird death."	['Because sunlight is highly focused in the desert.']
According the passage, The Pines is a _ .	While in Banff, make time for a walk around town. A special treat is to go up the mountainside on the Banff Gondola for a surprising view of the valley below. Here is The Pines, whose cook has developed a special way of mixing foreign food such as caribou, wild boar, and reindeer with surprising sauces. Best time to visit is during the off-season, from early May to mid-June, or in October. This way you can avoid sharing the highway with mobile homes which can be pulled by cars. But whatever the season, take some lunch with you from Banff, because there are only a few food stops on the road. Forty minutes north of Banff, side by side with the Banff National Park, sits world-famous Lake Louise. This surprisingly small body of water is attractive with towering mountains around it. Glaciers, huge masses of ice, moving very slowly against rocks, produce what is called glacier rock flour, making its water dark to see. It is worth taking a walk around the grounds of the Chateau Lake Louise, another beauty, proud of its early 20th century history. Back on the road, and it's time to continue north past the astonishing Columbia Icefield, then turn off the highway and take the short road to the base of the Athabaska Glacier. You can rent ice cleats and do some climbing or do a more pleasant snowmobile tour. Either way, you can enjoy endless beautiful sights. Finally you'll reach Jasper, the usual turning around the place for the Banff-Jasper loop . It's worth riding the Jasper Skytram, and be sure to visit the wonderful Jasper Park Lodge, also dating back to the 1920s. If you can have lunch there, do it. The restaurant has an adventurous menu and their wine list would put a smile on any visitor's face.	['restaurant where you can ask for some special kinds of food']
According to this text, why do some people have so much free time to relax ?	"Most people want to be successful, but never stop to think what it will really take to get there in their chosen field.

If you aren't prepared to do any of those things because they are outside of your comfort zone, then you can forget being succesful. I guarantee you will never reach your goals in life, unless your goals are to be ordinary. The biggest killer by far is the dreaded "" comfort zone "" where most people live in their entire life.

If you haven't built a successful business, or in some way built a career that allow you so much freee time, then you are stuck in the grinding world of nine-to-five jobs everyone else. So how comfortable is that ? So what can you do about it ? Well, find a way to make something happen in your life--- build a business around your favourite hobby, write a book and publish it, or take a course in stock trading and become an expert at that, working on making enough money to retire.

The best title for this passage is _ .	"Look at the light and beautiful snowflakes falling. Ever wanted to hold them in your hands? They are always lost when they meet your hands. Well, this isn't just a problem for you. It was a problem for Wilson Bentley, too. In the 1870s, Wilson Bentley was just a teenager. His family lived in a small town in northeast America. Winters there were long and hard. Bentley's mother was once a school teacher. She taught him at home. Bentley didn't go to school until he was 14. He was a quiet boy, and loved reading his mother's books. But he was interested in his mother's microscope . When the other boys were playing with balls, little Bentley was studying things like drops of water, flowers and snowflakes. Bentley loved watching snowflakes. For the next two years, young Bentley spent many winter days in a cold room watching these _ under his microscope. The boy thought they were beautiful enough for him to start to draw pictures of them. But there were so many snowflakes that he couldn't draw them all. How could he keep their beauty all the time? Bentley thought of buying a camera. The boy and his mother asked his father to buy one. But, his father didn't agree. He thought the whole thing was a bad idea. He thought the only thing a farmer should do was farming. But finally Bentley did get a camera. For more than a year he tried to take pictures of snowflakes. On January 15, 1885, during a snowstorm, Bentley took the first ever photo of an ice crystal with his camera. ""It was the greatest moment of my life,"" Bentley said later. For 13 years, Bentley worked quietly and took thousands of photos of ice crystals. Later he became famous as ""Snowflake"" Bentley."	['Snowflake Boy']
What's Paul Murdin's attitude to the plan?	"The plan: turn Mars into a blue world with streams and green fields, and then fill it with creatures from the earth. This idea may sound like something from a science fiction , but it is actually being taken seriously by many researchers. This suggests the future for the ""red planet"" will be the main topic for discussion at an international conference hosted by NASA this week. Leading researchers as well as science fiction writers will attend the event. Turning Mars into a little earth has long been a topic in science fiction,"" said Dr Michael Meyer, NASA's senior scientist for astrobiology .""Now, with scientists exploring the reality, we can ask what are the real possibilities of changing Mars."" Most scientists agree that Mars could be turned into a little earth, although much time and money would be needed to achieve this goal. But many experts are shocked by the idea. ""We are destroying our own world at an unbelievable speed and now we are talking about ruining another planet,"" said Paul Murdin from the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, UK.

Who was the speech made by?	Head teacher, teachers, grandparents, parents and classmates, I'm very proud that I have been chosen to speak to you all today. I'm a bit nervous as I've never made a speech before to so many people, so please forgive me if it shows! www.xkb1.com As we all know, this is the school leavers' party, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. We're sorry to leave you at the end of our junior high school education, and we promise that we'll never forget the happy times we have spent in these buildings with you all. I'd like to thank three groups of people for the three things I've learnt while I've been a pupil at our school. The three things are friendship, love and knowledge. The first group is my friends, and what I've learnt is the importance of friendship. We've worked hard together, we've even shared some difficult times together, but we've also had a lot of fun. Many of us will go to new schools and we may not see each other so often in the future. Others will go on to senior high school and continue their close friendships. But friends don't have to see each other all the time. Sometimes the friends you treasure most are the friends you see less often. A life without old friends is like a day without sunshine. We'll always stay in touch. The second group is our parents and grandparents. We thank you for the love you have shown us during our years at junior high school, for making a home where we feel both safe and relaxed, and where we can prepare ourselves for our school days. We also thank you for your help with our homework. How many of us owe our good grades to the suggestions you have made during those long evenings? And finally, the third group is our teachers. We can never pay you back for your kindness, your patience, and gift of knowledge which you have offered us; sometimes you've made us work very hard. But you have always been fair and you'll always be our role models. There's a saying from Ireland which is a favourite of mine: Strangers are only friends you haven't met yet. I couldn't say it better myself. So from the bottom of my heart, I thank you all and wish you success for the future.	['A student']
According to the passage, the writer probably agrees that _ .	Have you ever had the flu ? If you have, you know how bad it can make you feel. Most kids will get the flu sometime during their school years. When you have the flu, you usually get a fever (which can be high), have a cough , feel very tired, and may have a sore throat as well. It can make you feel sick for a few days or for as long as a week. Sometimes, it can be hard to tell if you have the flu or a cold, but with the flu, you'll usually have a higher fever and feel much worse. The flu is a type of virus , which means medicine will only help the _ such as the cough and fever. For most kids, the flu comes and goes, but for some, it can be a serious illness. Most kids get the flu in winter because germs spread more easily when kids are inside in settings such as classrooms. The best way to stop from getting the flu is to wash your hands often, keep your hands to yourself, and go to your doctor for the flu shot or mist .

"What does the author imply by saying ""there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery""?"	"Just as the English language has changed quickly in the previous century, so has the use of it. After the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was founded in 1927, the particular style of speech of the BBC announcers was recognized as standard English or Received Pronunciation (RP) English. Now, most people still consider that the pronunciation and delivery of BBC announcers is the clearest and most understandable spoken English. English has had a strong relationship with classes and social positions. However, since the Second World War there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery , and marks of class distinction such as styles of speech have been gradually diminishing, especially in the younger generation. By the end of the 1960s, it had become clear that it was not necessary to speak standard English or even correct grammar to become popular, successful and rich. The fashionable speech of the day was no longer the special right of a special class but rather a defiant expression of classlessness. The greatest single influence of the shaping of the English language in modern times is the American English. Over the last 25 years the English used by many people, particularly by those in the media, advertising and show business, has become more and more mid-Atlantic in style, delivery and accent. In the 1970s, fashion favored careless pronunciation and a language full of jargon, slang and ""in"" words, a great quantity of which couldn't be understood by the outside world. What is considered modern and fashionable in Britain today is often not the kind of English taught in schools and colleges."	"[""Most people don't believe the way of speaking by BBC announcers is much better than that of other people.""]"
Many students like to make friends online because _ .	These days many students like to make friends online. Most of them think it's interesting to know an unknown person through the Internet. So, many students like to use computers to talk with those friends. And they spend too much time on it. Some of them can not do well in their school work. Their parents often don't think the children are as good as before. So many teachers and parents are worried about their children. In fact, only very few of them can get real good friends in this way. Most of them were _ by those unseen friends. And some of the students did wrong things online. It's terrible for students to use too much time to make friends and talk online. So we should be careful of making friends online and should not spend too much time on it. We'd better pay more attention to study. We will be really happy when we do well in school and at home.	['they are interested in it']
The birthplace of the couple's second child Tehue must be in _ .	"For most families, a long car journey is the _ of any trip.But for the Zapps, their 83-year-old vehicle has been a home for the past 11 years, as the couple travel around the world on a never ending trip of a lifetime, covering 142,000 miles over four continents. Herman and Candelaria Zapp, who got married to each other in 1996 and to their journey in 2000, Set off from Patagonia, Argentina, heading for Alaska. They came back to Argentina in2004,but settled there only for a couple of weeks, before deciding the open road is the only way to live. They have been traveling ever since, with a trip around South America between 2005 and 2007, then central America, the U.S. and Canada until 2009.The car was shipped to Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea as they traveled those countries and they are currently in the Philippines on a tour of South East Asia. As a proof that life is possible in such a mobile style, the family of the two slowly grew to a number of six.They became, over the years and while on the road, parents to four children, Pampa (eight), Tehue (five), Paloma (three) and Wallaby (one). Remarkably, each of their kids has a different nationality. ""My grandfather knew that we wanted to travel and to never stop so he gave me the old Grdham-Paige car he used on his farm,"" Herman said. Each night the six Zapps either sleep in or around a tent set up next to their car, but more often than not they find a friendly local who will put them up for the night.The only hard rule the couple have to stick by, is the 40mph speed limit the 83-year old car is restricted to. Their trip is supported with the money coming from selling books they write about the places they visit."	['South America']

What does the author think of holidays?	"Why I've taken a break from holidays It is now close to four years since I last took a holiday.This is because I have come to the conclusion,over the course of my adult life,that I am not very good at it.You might think this sounds like saying you're not very good at drinking tea or listening to music.What could possibly be difficult about the natural act of putting your working life on hold for a couple of weeks and going somewhere warm to do nothing? I was a model holidaymaker as a kid.However,the problems started during my twenties.A trip to the south of France was ended after just two days,mainly because I had an urge to check my e-mails.Similarly,my honeymoon was cut short by 48 hours--not because my wife and I weren't enjoying ourselves,but because we were missing our cats. So what is my problem?On the surface,I'm probably a bit of a homebody.And I just find the pressure of being on holiday too severe:it always feels like having a gun held to my head and being forced to have fun.Somehow,packing a list of possessions and meeting a scheduled flight has none of the excitement of suddenly deciding to take a day off and driving somewhere for the fun of it. Thankfully,I'm not alone.This summer,most of my friends have decided not to have a break.And a recent survey proved the _ of holidays,with the results showing that nearly two thirds of people found that the calming effects of a holiday wore off within 24 hours,as stress levels returned to normal.And this year The Idler magazine published its Book of Awful Holidays.Here you will find a list of the five most ecologically-damaging vacations it's possible to take,along with 50 painful holiday experiences voted for on The Idler website. What interests me is what the concept of a ""holiday"" says about our lives.For me,the point of living is to have a life you enjoy for 52 weeks a year.The more I like my life and the better I structure it,the less I want to go away.Maybe I'm an unusual person for not liking holidays,but I just feel the time when I'm not working is too valuable to waste on them."

What's Katy Smith's advice for the parents?	"According to a recent report, kids in primary school spend about six hours every week doing their homework.. So kids hate homework. However, their parents hate homework, too. Is it good for kids to do homework? Of course, a great number of researches do show that kids can remember what they have learnt in class better by finishing their homework on time and homework itself plays an important role in developing their learning shills, such as independent thinking and creativity. But for parents, the result is not the same. After a day of hard work, most of them feel like they're going through school a second time when they sit down with their children each night to help with their homework. And a recent survey found that 46 percent of parents feel like they don't spend enough quality time with their children, because they spend too much time doing the housework or helping with homework. And another 29 percent of parents have arguments with their kids often when they have different answers to the same question. Now several education scientists strongly advise parents to stop helping. They say it will give their kids more independence and give parents back their free time. At the same time, the number of homework - connected arguments will be less at home. Katy Smith, an education scientist, says, "" You don't have to know everything. Children need to put their hands up for help and so do parents. Use your resources - online teachers, or even your neighborhood - just ask."""	['Look for professional help for their kids.']
Which of the followings best describes the writer's idea?	The law says women should have the chance of doing the same jobs as men and earn the same as them. The reality is very different. Women lose because, 25 years after the Equal Pay Act, many of them still get paid less than men. They lose because they do lower-paid jobs which men just won't consider. And they lose because they are the ones who interrupt a career to have children. All this is reported in an independent study ordered by the Government's women's unit. The biggest problem isn't equal pay in workplaces such as factories. It is the sort of work women do. Make a list of low-paid-jobs, then consider who does them. Try nurses, secretaries, cleaners, clerks, teachers in primary schools, dinner ladies and child-care helpers. Not a lot of men among that group, are there? Yet some of those jobs are really important. Surely no one would deny that about nurses and teachers, for a start. So why do we reward the people who do them so poorly? There can be only one answer--because they are women. This is not going to be put right overnight. But the government, which employs a lot of them, and other bosses have to make a start. It is disgraceful that we have gone into the 21st century still treating women like second-class citizens.	['Women and men should get equal pay for equal work.']
The natural and healthy eating can NOT _ .	"When it comes to feeling better about yourself,nothing will help you like healthy eating.Controlling what you eat is a big factor in how you look and feel.If you think about it,so much of how we behave,how we feel,and how our bodies perform is based on what we put into them. The old saying ""You Are What You Eat"" is actually true.The problem is that a lot of mainstream diet books you might find in your local bookstore or online are trying to sell you diet plans that don't work and that might even make you sick. Healthy eating is great for your body.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.Many people don't realize just how good healthy food is for them.By eating great foods that are natural and healthy,you can lose weight.You can also have a lot more energy.So you shouldn't just think of healthy eating as a way to burn fat,but you should also think of it as a way to get your life back in order. You can spend more time with your family and get more work done because you will have more energy.You will be impressed by how much better you'll feel by putting nutritious,natural foods into your body.Your look will be better.You'll have more energy,and you'll be happier. The important thing to remember when it comes to eating healthy is to not fall for any tricks.There are a lot of people out there looking to make quick money.They will tell you just something so they can sell a book or a video.What you need is to trust a diet plan that is right for your body.Educate yourself about your own body type.Find out what kinds of foods are best for you.If the diet book you trust doesn't teach you these important factors,then you might be reading bad information."

Which of the following is NOT mentioned about mothers with children?	"You'd be forgiven for thinking that running after children each day would leave parents in the best shape of their lives.But a study has found that the mothers and fathers of young children are more unhealthy than their childless peers . Mothers with young children are heavier and eat more calories and fatty foods,and consume more sugary dinks than chidless women,scientists said.And both sexes are less active than those in their age group without children. Parents often choose quick,easily preparesd foods that are high in fat and calories,and by choosing these foods they may in turn serve them to their children,forming a cycle of unhealthy diet. Dr.Berge,one of the study authors,said:""This isn't a study about blame,this is about spotting a very high-risk time period for parents that doctors should be aware of ,so they can offer solutions ."" According to the study ,mothers ate more fatty foods and drank about seven sugary drinks weekly,equal to about four chidless women.They also had an average of 2,360 calories daily,368 calories more than women without children,With that many calorise,women that age would need to be active to avoid to avoid gaining weight. Fathers ate about the same amount of daily calories childless men and both had an average boby-mass index ,but fathersgot less physical activity--about five hours weekly ,compared to almost seven hours among chidless men. The study has several limitations-there's no data on how many women reccently had babies.Ther's also no information on the number of single parents,who likely face diet and exercise challenges.Sarah Kriger,an American dietician who works with new mothers said some of the mothers may have had postpartum depression,which might affect their eating and exercise habits."

This passage mainly discusses _ .	"Tea drinking was common in China for nearly one thousand years before anyone in Europe had ever heard about tea.People in Britain were much slower in finding out what tea was like, mainly because tea was very expensive. It could not be bought in shops and even those people who could afford to have it sent from Holland did so only because it was a fashionable curiosity. Some of them were not sure how to use it. They thought it was a vegetable and tried cooking the leaves. Then they served them mixed with butter and salt. They soon discovered their mistake but many people used to spread the used tea leaves on bread and give them to their children as sandwiches. Tea remained scarce and very expensive in England until the ships of the East India Company began to bring it direct from China early in the seventeenth century. During the next few years so much tea came into the country that the price fell and many people could afford to buy it. At the same time people on the Continent were becoming more and more fond of tea.Until then tea had been drunk without milk in it, but one day a famous French lady named Madame de Sevigne decided to see what tea tasted like when milk was added.She found it so pleasant that she would never again drink it without milk. Because she was such a great lady her friends thought they must copy everything she did, so they also drank their tea with milk in it. Slowly this habit spread until it reached England and today only very few Britons drink tea without milk. At first, tea was usually drunk after dinner in the evening No one ever thought of drinking tea in the afternoon until a duchess found that a cup of tea and a piece of cake at three or four o'clock stopped her getting ""a sinking feeling"" as she called it. She invited her friends to have this new meal with her and so, tea-time was born."	['the history of tea drinking in Britain']
Explosions happened when _ .	QINGDAO--Water and power supplies have been _ in the East Chinese city of Qingdao, the site of an oil pipeline explosion on Friday, the local government said on Monday. Crude oil began leaking from the pipeline at 3:00 an Friday in Qingdao in Shandong province. The valves of the Huangdao oil warehouse were shut about 15 minutes later. The oil spill then flowed into the city's rainwater pipe network, which empties into Jiaozhou Bay. Explosions occurred at two locations around 10:30 am Friday when workers were clearing the spill. According to the local government, about 85 percent of public heating and 90 percent of the gas supply were also brought back to normal as of Monday. Residents who have been taken to the temporary settlements are receiving bottled water and bread. Many schools and kindergartens have reopened classes after Friday's oil pipeline explosion. No injures and deaths of students or teachers have been reported following the explosions at an underground pipeline operated by Sinopec. The school buildings of one middle school in the district were seriously damaged during the explosions. Education authorities have arranged psychological help for students and teaching staff. All other 18 schools and kindergartens in the district reopened classes on Monday. As of Monday noon, the death toll from the explosion had risen to 55, with 9 people still missing and 136 hospitalized. According to local police, 49 bodied have been identified so far, and 42 of them were male victims. As of Monday morning, the blood supply in Qingdao was enough for the injured after more than 950 people in the city donated more than 340,000 ml of blood in the wake of the incident.

According to the famous teacher in England, a teacher can _ .	"""Depend on yourself"" is what nature says to every man. Parents can help you. Teachers can help you. But all these only help you to help yourself. There have been many men in history. But many of them were very poor in childhood, and no uncles, aunts or friends to help them. Schools were few. They could not depend upon themselves for an education. They saw how it was and set to work with all their strength to know something. They worked their own way till they became well known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, ""I can not make worthy men of you, but I can help make men of yourself."" Some young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable to the human beings. They can never gain achievement unless they see their weak points and change their course. They are nothing now, and will be nothing as long as they live, unless they accept the advice of their parents and teachers, and depend on their own efforts."

In which part of the newspaper can the passage be found?	When JetBlue captain Clayton Osbon became unpredictable, his co-pilot invented a reason for him to go back into the cabin.Once the captain was out of the cockpit , the co-pilot locked the door to keep the captain from returning.Passengers, some with law enforcement experience, calmed the captain.The flight changed course to Amarillo, Texas where the captain was hospitalized. Incidents in which a pilot has had an in-flight psychological breakdown are rare.But how could it happen at all? Though pilots are required to have an examination at least once a year by a physician approved by the FAA, there are no formal procedures in place to test pilots for signs of psychological problems. At most airlines, pilots are members of a union.A pilot who appears to have a psychological or an alcohol problem can be reported to a union member whose job it is to investigate.If there is a problem, the pilot is given the choice of getting treatment or being reported to management.But at airlines, such as Allegiant, JetBlue, and Virgin American where there is no union, pilots are - to say the least - unwilling to report a fellow pilot to management. In most professions, a person experiencing emotional difficulties is free to consult a doctor.Rut an airline pilot in therapy is viewed with suspicion both by the airline and by the FAA.No pilot wants to be put under extra examination by an agency that has the power to _ their license or end their employment.That being the case, pilots are less likely than people in other professions to seek help. There may be no way to make sure this never happens again, but its possibility can be reduced. Tests such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI) can reliably detect depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and other problems.The FAA could require pilots to take the MMPI or a similar test on a periodic basis.Whether such testing becomes required will depend upon the public's response to this incident and whether additional incidents take place. Flying is remarkably safe.But incidents such as this cause concern.	['Society']

All the following steps can make one's fingers stronger EXCEPT _ .	Typing Success in 20 Minutes a Day -- Teaching Your K-12 Students to Type in 20 Minutes a Day Typing is fast becoming an important skill in our world. Making this skill available to your students is very important. Just 20 minutes of the following activities per day will give your students the finger strength and keyboard knowledge they need to be ready to include typing in their learning programs. Step 1 Knitting : You can try various styles until you find the one that best suits your students' abilities. Finger knitting is a great way to start! It helps students focus on finger strength. Knitting with needles is a little more challenging but will suit some older students. The more practice the fingers get the stronger they will become. Step 2 Key board games: It helps your students become familiar with the keyboard. Students as young as four years old can practice finger placement, letter sounds and names using the keyboard of computers. Step 3 Clay modeling: Many children develop the ability to be quick and skilful with their hands through creating clay models. The creative nature of this activity keeps children engaged for long periods of time. It helps keep fingers strong and supple. Step 4 Lego building: Little fingers become strong when children pull apart little Lego time and time again. Because of the fun nature of this activity it helps build and does a lot to reinforce the ability to arrange things into an order -- another important aspect in typing. Choose an age-appropriate, interactive and engaging typing program. All students are different and with firm finger skills typing can be easily learned in 20 minutes a day with the use of a mixture of these different approaches.	['Step2']

What does the author advise people to do when stress hits them?	If you experience great stress in your life on a frequent basis, you're not alone. Nowadays, stress is almost a given fact of life. Actually, a certain degree of stress can have positive effects on us. But if stress continues over a long period of time, the effects on the body can be harmful, resulting in health problems and stress-related illness, including heart attack and stroke. Stress is a normal reaction by the body to what it perceives as a threatening situation or environment. Short-term reactions may include an increase in heart rate as well as a rise in blood pressure. A person under short-term stress may feel nervous, anxious and even experience shortness of breath. Other reactions can include a dry mouth, quick heartbeat, sweating, stomach upset and diarrhea. When stress is long-term and becomes more chronic in nature, it can cause more serious health-related problems, including regular headaches, back pain, weight changes, sleep difficulties, changes in mood and so on. Chronic stress can also result in memory problems, including difficulty remembering new information and the inability to quickly deal with old information. No matter how your body reacts to stress, ignoring the problem can have serious health results. Not surprisingly, more women than men openly seek the help of their family doctors or other health care experts when they are experiencing stress or stress-related illness. Men are more likely to refuse to admit the problem or attempt to self-treat it, which may contribute to higher rate of drug and alcohol addiction seen in men exposed to chronic stress. There's no doubt that stress is a fact of life and is likely to remain a part of our fast-paced society. Although stress can't be completely _ , methods of dealing with stress-related issues, in my view, can be developed so that the effects of stress on the body are avoided, so people won't be so easy to suffer stress-related illness.	['They should seek more methods of dealing with it.']
Which of the following is true?	"New York is one of the last large American cities to have some of its policemen on horseback. The New York police have 170 horses working in certain parts of the city. The horses are expensive to feed, but it is even more expensive to look after them. Because the horses must walk on the streets, they need special horseshoes. In fact , they need more than 8,000 of them each year. Every police horse in New York gets new shoes every month. Keeping these shoes in good repair is the job of six blacksmiths. There are only about thirty-five of these blacksmiths in the whole United States. The cost of shoing a horse is between twenty dollars and thirty-five dollars, and it takes a good blacksmith two or three hours to do the job. A blacksmith's job is not an easy one. He must be able to shape a shoe from a piece of metal and then fit it to the horse's foot. The blacksmith must bend over all the time when he is fitting the shoe and must hold the weight of the horse's leg while he works. Clearly, a blacksmith must be very storng. But even more important, he must be able to deal with horses---for before the blacksmith can begin his work, he has to get the horse to lift its leg. One of the blacksmiths in New York is James Corbin. He came to the country from Ireland in 1948. He not only makes horseshoes for the police but also works for a group of horse owners near the city. Corbin became interested in blacksmithing because his father did it, and,as the puts it, ""It's a good way to make a living."""	['Only a few large American cities have some policemen on horseback.']
The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to be _ .	"Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deep into a long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project. Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in the world those readers really want. But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set of standard patterns into which they plug each day's events. In other words, there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news. There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps explain why the ""standard patterns"" of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and asked the same questions. Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedes, and trade stocks, and they're less likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community. Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to reflect the conventional values of this elite. The surprising distrust of the news media isn't rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and their readers. This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class."	['rather superficial']
What is the author's attitude towards people with disabilities?	"I spotted (;) him at the checkout counter, bagging at No.14. His arms shook violently as he placed a box of eggs into a plastic bag. He wore a name card upon which he had wiritten ""Jerry"" in kindergarten handwriting. He looked middle-aged but his mental age must have been about 12. Ever since I smiled at him the first time he bagged my groceries at my local supermarket, Jerry has followed me around like an adoring fan. His lack of boundaries makes me uncomfortable. I don't know how to avoid being noticed by him. I don't want to speak to the manager -- my complaint could get him fired. So I started avoiding him. I can still remember the hurt I felt when I was 10 and our neighbor Mrs. Ward didn't respond when I said hello with David and Diane. Instead, she hurried out of the supermarket, leaving me holding my brother and sister's hands. I realized at that moment that I hated Mrs. Ward's reaction. Why, then, years later, was I acting as she had? I picked up a magazine Real Simple. The beautiful photos did nothing to straighten out the guilt in me. I was being ridiculous. The last three times I have seen Jerry, I rushed. There are other stores, but I chose this one because it employs people with disabilities. I want people like my brothers to have jobs. I don't want them to be ignored, the way I am avoiding Jerry."	['caring']
The author knew the man was homeless judging by _ .	One Saturday morning we were on our way home and decided to stop at a local gas station to get something to eat since it was a good hour and a half before we got home. We noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. You could tell that he was a homeless man. His clothes were worn and dirty, and not enough on this terrible cold day of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat. The next thing I remember is a dog that walked up to the front of the building. Being a dog lover, I noticed she was part wolf and probably part German shepherd . I could tell she had been feeding puppies . She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not make it. We noticed people walked by and didn't even care for her. She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still deserved better. We still did not do anything. But someone did. The homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went into the store in front of him. Any what he did brought tears to me and my wife. He brought a can of dog food with what money he may have had and fed that dog. I was so moved and walked to him and gave him all my pocket money. I know this story isn't as moving as most stories, but it plays a great part in our lives. You see, that day was Mother's Day. And a lot of people forget that some animals are parents too. And animals as well as we are God's creations. The homeless man showed me what I should have done. He made a decision to be a better man in future.	['the clothes the man wore']
What is the purpose of this passage?	"Long bus rides are like television shows. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end with commercials thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. ""Buy Super Clean Toothpaste."" ""Drink Good Wet Root Beer."" ""Fill up with Pacific Gas. ""Only when you have fallen asleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, can you get separated from the unending cry of ""You Need It! Buy It Now!"" As for the ride itself, the beginning of it is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless or daring, the ride can be as thrilling as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that. The seat, of course, has become harder for the hours having passed. By now you may sit with your legs crossed, or with your hands in your lap, or with your hands on the arms, or even with your hands crossed behind your head. That is to say that the end comes just at no more ways to sit."	"[""To give the writer's opinion about long bus trips.""]"

"No matter in China or in Canada among my friends, they all talk about the hot TV program ""Where are we going, Dad?"" at present. They all like the family education between fathers and children. They like to talk about the funny kids best. Of all the kids, I like Shitou best. Shitou is a boy from Beijing. He is brave and clever. He likes to make some New Year's plans with his father's help. He makes some New Year's plans for himself. He wants to start an exercise program, so he is going to take more exercise and eat less fast food.

"David Smith refers to himself as having been ""a clothes addict,"" because _ ."	"Five years ago, David Smith wore an expensive suit to work every day. ""I was a clothes addict,"" he jokes. ""I used to carry a fresh suit to work with me so I could change if my clothes got wrinkled."" Today David wears casual clothes--khaki pants and sports shirt--to the office. He hardly ever wears a necktie. ""I'm working harder than ever,"" David says, ""and I need to feel comfortable."" More and more companies are allowing their office workers to wear casual clothes to work. In the United States, the change from formal to casual office wear has been gradual. In the early 1990s, many companies allowed their employees to wear casual clothes on Friday, but only on Friday. This became known as ""dress-down Friday"" or ""casual Friday"". ""What started out as an extra one-day-a-week benefit for employees has really become an everyday thing."" said business consultant Maisly Jones. Why have so many companies started allowing their employees to wear casual clothes? One reason is that it's easier for a company to attract new employees if it has a casual dress code. ""A lot of young people don't want to dress up for work,"" says the owner of a software company, ""so it's hard to hire people if you have a conservative dress code."" Another reason is that people seem happier and more productive when they are wearing comfortable clothes. In a study conducted by Levi Strauss Company, 85 percent of employers said that they believe that casual dress improves employee morale . Only 4 percent of employers said that casual dress has a negative effect on productivity. Supporters of casual office wear also argue that a casual dress code helps them save money. ""Suits are expensive, if you have to wear one every day,"" one person said. ""For the same amount of money, you can buy a lot more casual clothes."""

This selection says that the Egyptians played _	The first true piece of sports equipment that man invented was the ball. In ancient Egypt, as everywhere, pitching stones was a favorite children's game. But a badly thrown rock could hurt a child. Looking for something less dangerous to throw, the Egyptians made what were probably the first balls. At first, balls were made of grass or leaves held together by vines . Later they were made of pieces of animal skin sewed together and stuffed with feathers or hay. Even though the Egyptians were warlike, they found time for peaceful games. Before long they had developed a number of ball games, each with its own set of rules. Perhaps they played ball more for instruction than for fun. Ball playing was thought of mainly as a way to teach young men the speed and skill they would need for war.	['many different games with balls']
All the toys that the teacher showed _ .	"A teacher showed three toys to his students and asked them to find out the differences. All the three toys seemed to have the same shape, size and material. After looking at them carefully, the students discovered holes in the toys. The first toy had holes in the ears. The second toy had holes in its ear and mouth. The third toy had only one hole in one of its ears. Then the teacher put a needle in one ear hole of the first toy. The needle came out of the other ear. For the second toy, when the needle was put in its ear , it came out of its mouth. And for the third toy, when the needle was put in, it did not come out. So the teacher explained to his students,"" The first toy represent those people who seem to be listening to you and caring for you. But they are just pretending to do so. After listening, as the needle comes out from the next ear, the things you said to them are gone. In fact, they don't care for you at all."" ""The second toy represents those people who listen to you and care for you. But as in the toy, the needle comes out from mouth, these people will use what you tell them to fight against you. They tell others what you said and tell your secrets for their purposes."" ""As for the third toy, the needle does not come out. It represents those people who will keep the trust you put in them. They are the ones that you can believe."""	['had different holes']

I'm now writing to ask you something about American social customs . My American friends want me to join them in their dinner party. I am very happy and have decided to go, but I'm a little worried about it, too. The social customs in my country are very different from here, so I'm afraid of making mistakes. Should I bring a present, such as sweets or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late? At the dinner table, how can I know which fork or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness? Wang Lin Letter B Dear Wang Lin, It's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine if you know that your friends drink it. You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them. Try to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you. If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after. Rose	['helpful']

Why did the author ask Stevie to clean up the mess on the table?	"I try not to be biased but I had my doubts about hiring Stevie. His social worker assured me that he would be a good, reliable busboy. But I had never had a mentally handicapped employee. He was short, a little fat, with the smooth facial features and thick-togued speech of Down's Syndrome . I thought most of my customers would be uncomfortable around Stevie, so I closely watched him for the first few weeks. I shouldn't have worried. After the first week, Stevie had my staff wrapped around his stubby little finger, and within a month my regular trucker customers had adopted him as their official truck stop mascot. After that, I really didn't care what the rest of the customers thought of him. He was like a 21-year-old in blue jeans and Nikes, eager to laugh and eager to please, but fierce in his attention to his duties. Every salt and pepper shaker was exactly in its place, not a bread crumb or coffee spill was visible when Stevie got done with the table. Our only problem was persuading him to wait to clean a table until after the customers were finished. Over time, we learned that he lived with his mother, a widow who was disabled. Money was tight, and _ . That's why the restaurant was a gloomy place that morning last August, the first morning in three years that Stevie missed work. He was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester getting a heart surgery. His social worker said that people with Downs Syndrome often had heart problems at an early age and there was a good chance he would come through the surgery in good shape and be back at work in a few months. A ripple of excitement ran through the staff later that morning when word came that he was out of surgery, in recovery, and doing fine. Frannie, my head waitress, did a little dance when she heard the good news. Belle Ringer, one of our regular trucker customers, stared at her and asked, ""Okay, Frannie, what was that all about?"" ""We just got word that Stevie is out of surgery and going to be okay."" ""I was wondering where he was. I had a new joke to tell him. What was the surgery about?"" Frannie quickly told Belle Ringer and the other two drivers sitting at his booth about Stevie's surgery, then sighed: ""Yeah, I'm glad he is going to be OK,"" she said. ""But I don't know how he and his Mom are going to handle all the bills. From what I hear, they're barely getting by as it is."" Belle Ringer nodded thoughtfully, and Frannie hurried off to wait on the rest of her tables. After the morning rush, Frannie walked into my office. She had a couple of paper napkins in her hand. ""What's up?"" I asked. ""I cleared off that table where Belle Ringer and his friends were sitting after they left, and I found this. This was folded and tucked under a coffee cup."" She handed the napkin to me, and three $20 bills fell onto my desk when I opened it. On the outside, in big, bold letters, was printed ""Something For Stevie"". That was three months ago. Today is New Year's day , the first day Stevie is supposed to be back to work. His placement worker said he had been counting the days until the doctor said he could work, I arranged to have his mother bring him to work, met them in the parking lot and invited them both to celebrate his day back. I took him and his mother by their arms. ""To celebrate you coming back, breakfast for you and your mother is on me."" I led them toward a large corner booth. I could feel and hear truck customers and the rest of the staff following behind as we marched through the dining room. We stopped in front of the big table. Its surface was covered with coffee cups and dinner plates, all sitting slightly on dozens of folded paper napkins. ""First thing you have to do, Stevie, is clean up this mess,"" I said. Stevie looked at me, and then pulled out one of the napkins. It had ""Something for Stevie"" printed on the outside. As he picked it up, two $10 bills fell onto the table. Stevie stared at the money, then at all the napkins peeking from beneath the tableware, each with his name printed on it. I turned to his mother. ""There's more than $10,000 in cash and checks on that table, all from truckers and trucking companies that heard about your problems. Happy Thanksgiving!"" While everybody else was busy shaking hands and hugging each other, Stevie, with a big, big smile on his face, was busy clearing all the cups and dishes from the table."

People from all parts of the world go to visit Venice because _ .	"Venice is the ""Queen"" of the Adriatic Sea . Every year thousands of people from all over the world travel to Italy to visit the city. Do you know why they like to go there for a visit? Venice is a very beautiful city. It is quite different from other cities in the world. There aren't any roads or streets in the city, so there aren't any cars or buses. There are many canals in the city. There is one big canal and one hundred and seventy-seven small canals. People move up and down the canals in boats to go to work, go shopping or visit their friends. But Venice is sinking It is going down and the water is going up. In 2040 Venice will be under water. The Adriatic Sea will cover the city. The Venetians love their city and want to stay there. So they want to save Venice form the sea. They do not want to leave. How can they save Venice? They can build some strong huge walls and gates in the sea. The gates will close to keep too much water out. In this way Venice will not sink."	['it is beautiful and quite different from other cities']

What do we know about the Pompeians who lived 2000 years ago?	Every year thousands of tourists visit Pompeii, Italy. They see the sights that Pompeii is famous for-its stadium and theatres, its shops and restaurants. The tourists do not, however, see Pompeii's people. They do not see them because Pompeii has no people. No one has lived in Pompeii for almost 2000 years. Once, Pompeii was a busy city of 22,000 people. It lay at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, a grass-covered volcano. Mount Vesuvius had not erupted for centuries, so the people of Pompeii felt safe, But they were not. In August of AD 79 , Mount Vesuvius erupted. The entire top of the mountain exploded, and a huge black cloud rose into the air. Soon stones and hot ash began to fall on Pompeii . When the eruption ended , Pompeii was hurried under 20 feet of stones and ashes. Almost all of its people were dead. For centuries, Pompeii lay buried under stone and ash. Then, in the year 1861,an Italian scientist named Ginseppe began to uncover Pompeii. Slowly, carefully, Ginseppe and his men dug. The city looked almost the same as it had looked in AD79 , There were streets and fountains, houses and shops, There was a stadium with 20,000 seats , Perhaps the most important of all, there were everyday objects, which tell us a great deal about the people who lived in Pompeii. Many glasses and jars had some dark blue color in the bottom, so we know that the people of Pompeii liked wine, They liked bread, too; metal bread pans were in the bakery .In one bakery there were 81 round , flat loaves of bread -a type of bread that is still sold in Italy today . Tiny boxes filled with a dark, shiny powder tell us that women liked to wear eye-makeup.	['They lived more or less the same as Italians now do .']
To become wealthy,one should _ .	Wealth is what you accumulate ,not what you spend.If you make $1 million a year and spend $1 million,you're not getting wealthier,you're just living high. The most successful accumulators of wealth spend less than they can afford on houses,cars,vacations and entertainment.Why? Because these things offer little or no return.The wealthy would rather put their money into investments or their businesses.It's an attitude. Millionaires understand that when you buy an expensive house,you buy an expensive life-style too.Your property taxes ,insurance,and the prices of nearby services tend to be higher. The rich man's attitude can also be seen in his car.many drive old cars.Sam Walton,billionaire founder of the Wal-Mart Store,Inc,drove a pickup truck. Most millionaires measure success by net worth ,not income.Instead of taking their money home,they put as much as they can into their businesses.Why? Because the government doesn't tax wealth;it taxes income you bring home for consumption . The person who piles up net worth fastest tends to put every dollar he can into investments,not consumption. The best wealth-builders pay careful attention to their money and seek professional advice. The self-made rich develop clear goals for their money.They may wish to retire early,or they may want to leave something to their children.The goals vary,but two things are consistent:they have a goal in mind-- the amount they want to save by age50,perhaps--and they work unceasingly toward that goal. One thing may surprise you.If you make wealth---not just income--your goal,the expensive house you've been dreaming about won't seem so attractive.you'll have the attitude.	['work hard unceasingly']

Wat's the best way to learn English well according to the passage?	Can you swim? Do you like swimming? Well, how can you learn to swim? I think the best way is to go into the water and learn. I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about Swimming or looking at others swimming. It's the same with the English study. We must practice, practice and practice. Listening and speaking are very important for beginners. We can listen to English programs on radio. You may just understand a few words. It doesn't matter. Just be relaxed, try to catch every word. Somebody may be a good listener, but he is afraid to speak because he's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone as long as he knows English. When there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make. Reading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense. This is very important. It's easier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English well in this way. ,A, B, C, D,. (10)	['By doing more practice.']
The writer mentions a car on a hot summer day to _ .	Everyone talks about the greenhouse effect and how our Earth and its climate are being affected. We can do a science experiment designed by some kids to show this effect and what is happening to the Earth. First prepare the following items: *2 glass containers that need to be the same size and shape *1 gallon plastic bag *4 cups of very cold water *Ice cubes Fill each container with two cups of cold water. Add the same amount of ice cubes to each container. Then put one of the containers in the plastic bag and close it tight. Put both containers in the sun together and keep them there for at least an hour. At the end of one hour remove the container from the plastic bag and immediately check the temperature of the water. After you record this, find out the temperature of the water that is not covered. When you place the containers in direct sunlight, the air inside the bag becomes very warm. The heat filters in but cannot escape so it stays in the closed plastic bag and increases the temperature. What if you leave that for two, three or four hours? Think about what is happening to the Earth. There are chemicals that are creating a type of plastic bag around the Earth. It causes our air to get warmer because of the heat from the sun being kept in this closed area. Think about your car in the hot summer. This is what happens when you leave your car outside all day. This greenhouse effect has caused your car to be so hot that you sometimes cannot even touch the steering wheel. This science project goes to show what affects our planet.

According to the passage, we can know that one focus of marine geology is _ .	Scientists study the ocean in many different ways. Although many marine scientists focus on animals in the ocean, others seek to gain a better understanding of the ocean's chemical and physical components . Scientists are learning a great deal about the natural and human-caused processes that shape the ocean and its many life forms. Much of the present research focuses on how human activity influences the ocean. Clean water is a limited resource, and ocean pollution does harm to plant and animal health. Some scientists are now studying ocean water to find out just how contaminated it is. Scientists are also working on new methods to estimate the presence of poisons in the ocean, which will help them develop better techniques for cleaning up the water. Others look at how sea living things get used to poisons because poisonous sea life has an effect on humans too. For example, some seafood is poisoned, which may cause a threat to humans who eat it. Another type of marine scientist tries to learn more about the history of the ocean. Understanding the ocean's past tells scientists more about its patterns and cycles today and in the future. The ocean's past, which is recorded by deposits in the ocean floor, helps scientists understand such important matters as global climate change and other environmental differences. The more researchers learn about the history of the ocean and its relation to climatic and environmental changes, the more likely that they will one day understand what causes such changes. Other scientists are concerned with understanding how ocean systems work. The word systems refers to all the conditions and elements that are continually changing the ocean. Understanding these systems is necessary to protect the ocean and ensure the safety of its life forms. The cycles of ocean life also have an enormous effect on human life; for example, studying coastal waters is important because they provide much of the fish that humans eat. Marine geologists are earth scientists who work along the ocean floor. The Ocean Drilling Program, a 20-nation effort, drills the ocean floor and removes material for study. Among other achievements, this program has found evidence of a giant meteorite impact ,which supports the theory that dinosaurs died out after the earth suffered a climate change caused by a crash with a large meteor. Other marine geologists focus on more recent events, such as the destruction of shorelines.	['the history of the ocean']
What is the healthiest amount of sleep for the majority of people according to the article?	"One of the tough things about being a high school student is that you never seem to get enough sleep at night, which often leaves you nodding off during classes. ""The best amount of sleep to get is about seven and a half to eight hours,"" Peter Venn at Queen Victoria Hospital, UK, told The Telegraph. Spending either less than six or more than nine hours in sleeping puts your health at risk. A popular solution to a lack of sleep at night is to take a ""power nap"" during the day, but does this work? Generally speaking, it can be beneficial. Research shows that a nap in the middle of the day --even a brief one as short as five or 10 minutes ---can clear your mind and leave you with increased energy and improved productivity , according to Forbes. However, as refreshing as it might be, if you are getting adequate sleep at night, taking a power nap isn't such a wise choice. The reason is that sleeping during the day can interfere with your body's biorhythms . The brain gets used to going to bed at roughly the same time each night and getting up at the same time each day, and you don't want to disturb this routine. One more thing to keep in mind is that a power nap should never be used as a replacement for a good night's sleep. ""Twenty minutes of power nap during the day is not like a tablet which will definitely work,"" Rahul Mukherjee, an Indian sleep specialist, told The Telegraph. ""An hour's sleep before midnight is worth a couple of hours' sleep after midnight."""	['About seven and a half to eight hours.']
What attracted the author most at this year's festival?	Glastonbury Festival, one of the pioneer festivals, is famous not only for its amazing bands, but also for its wonderful performances in many fields surrounding the stages. It attracts over 130,000 people every year, who join in the three-day party to celebrate the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. Glastonbury Festival has been held on Worthy Farm in Somerset since 1970. This year, all sorts of singers and bands were there, from the likes of Beyonce, Jessie J, to my favorite -- Paolo Nutini, who I really wish I could have met! We drove straight in to one of the muddiest Glastonbury Festivals ever! We came to our camp site, carrying enough clothes for a weekend of extreme weather conditions, and spent an hour or so putting up the tent. On the second day it began to rain and didn't stop for the rest of the day. We sat in the tent waiting for it to stop, and after several hours we realized that it wouldn't. When the need for food became too strong we put on boots and raincoats and made our way across many muddy fields. There is something for everyone at the festival -- my favourite place is the Circus Field, which is full of interactive performances. Also, I love the Kidz Field, where famous CBBC stars perform, and where you can get your face painted then run around on a climbing frame with dragons.	['The performance in the Circus Field.']
The writer's first job was _ .	My father was a foreman of a sugar-cane plantation in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. My first job was to drive the oxen that ploughed the cane fields. I would walk behind an ox, guiding him with a broomstick. For $ 1 a day, I worked eight hours straight, with no food breaks. It was very _ work, but it prepared me for life and taught me many lasting lessons. Because the plantation owners were always watching us, I had to be on time every day and work as hard as I could. I've never been late for any job since. I also learned about being respectful and faithful to the people you work for. More important, I earned my pay; it never entered my mind to say I was sick just because I didn't want to work. I was only six years old, but I was doing a man's job. Our family needed every dollar we could make because my father never earned more than $ 18 a week. Our home was a three-room wood shack with a dirty floor and no toilet. Nothing made me prouder than bringing home money to help my mother, father, two brothers and three sisters. This gave me self-esteem , one of the most important things a person can have. When I was seven, I got work at a golf course near our house. My job was to stand down the fairway and spot the balls as they landed, so the golfers could find them. Losing a ball meant you were fired, so I never missed one. Some nights I would lie in bed and dreamt of making thousands of dollars by playing golf and being able to buy a bicycle. The more I dreamed, the more I thought. Why not? I made my first golf club out of guava limb and a piece of pipe. Then I hammered an empty tin can into the shape of a ball. And finally I dug two small holes in the ground and hit the ball back and forth. I practiced with the same devotion and intensity . I learned working in the field -- except now I was driving golf balls with club, not oxen with a broomstick .	['to drive the oxen that ploughed the cane fields']
The passage is written to _	"Digital wallets have been called the future of real-world payment technology. With major players like Alipay, WecChat and Apple Pay becoming popular, it seems to be a safe bet that a change in consumer payment technology is coming soon. A recent study by Citi Retail Services found that a growing number of people are embracing digital wallets, due in large part to their convenience and ease of use , ""There's no question 2016 will be an important year as digital wallets gain more acceptance."", Leslie MeNamara, managing director of partner management, Citi Retail Services, noted. Last month, CNN reporter Will Ripley experience a day in Beijing without his wallet. ""In China's largest cities, you can definitely survive without carrying a pocket full of cash and credit cards- as long as you've got your smartphone,"" he wrote. ""A huge number of businesses in Beijing accept mobile payments."" He paid for breakfast by scanning a QR code on the window of a hole-in-the -wall restaurant. All he had to do was enter a password and the transaction was completed. Then he also used his phone to pay for movies tickets, buy takeout food, order goods for delivery. In fact, he was not the only one to enjoy this convenience. His assistant Shen Lu also paid her household water bill with her mobile phone. In seconds, she was able to transfer funds( ) from one of several linked accounts. Unlike the situations in the US and other countries, ""China doesn't have a really money-making credit card system"". Gu Yu, co-founder of the new payment app Mileslife, told CNN.

Johnson nodded his smooth, dark head. That was something he knew very well. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" the manager admitted. Johnson nodded again. ""No?"" he said politely. Then he added, ""But I think you will, sir. A very great deal of it."" He appeared to think for a moment. ""I think you will find it will be on sale seven, perhaps, eight years from now."" He smiled. The manager thought that was uncertain. He said, ""It is better than our fish oils. I admit that."" ""So I am told, sir,"" agreed Johnson. ""Have you any plans to produce it yourself, Mr Johnson?"" Johnson smiled again. ""Would I be showing it to you if I had?"" ""We might add some chemicals to one of our own fish oils,"" said the manager. ""It would be expensive to do that, even if you could."" Johnson said gently. ""Besides,"" he added, ""I am told that this oil will be much cheaper than your best fish oils. Cheaper than any vegetable oil, in fact."" ""Perhaps,"" said the manager. ""Well, I suppose you want to make an arrangement, Mr Johnson, Shall we discuss it?"" ""Of course,"" said Johnson. ""There are two ways of dealing with a situation of this sort. The usual one is to prevent it altogether or at least to delay it as long as possible.

The manager had his doubts, but all he said was an inquiring(asking), ""Oh?"" ""The other way,"" continued Johnson, ""is to produce yourself before the trouble starts."""

The best title for this passage may be _ .	"Lego,the inventor of those color1ful bricks that have inspired kids' imagination worldwide,has celebrated its 53rd anniversary. In 1958,a man named Godtfred created the plastic building bricks that can now be found in almost every child's toy box. The simple building block has become one of the most well-known and popular toys around the world. ""The Lego brick continues to be very attractive,because it allows children,and others,to develop their creativity and imagination,"" said Charlotte Simonsen,a spokeswoman of Lego. The company's building brick allows an endless number of links. With just two bricks there are 24 different links,and with six,there are 915 million possibilities,according to Lego. A half century after its creation,more than 400 million children and adults spend five billion hours a year putting the bricks together and pulling them apart. Also,the bricks made today can still link with those made in 1958. Lego bricks aren't just child's play: they also attract the interest of adults. South Korean adventurer,Heo Young Ho,who climbed Mount Everest in 1987,left a Lego toy behind in the snow during his climb. After its great success Lego experienced a serious crisis at the end of the 1990s,hit hard by competition from electronic games. Lego then suffered a dark period that lasted several years. With great efforts,the company began to be popular again,and in 2006 it earned about 1.5 billion dollars in 130 countries. Seven boxes of Lego are now sold every second around the world,and 19 billion bricks are produced each year: enough to encircle the Earth five times!"	['The Brilliant History of Lego Bricks']
The toad was able to arrive in South Africa alive _ .	"JOHANNESBURG--They say cats have nine lives. Now a Chinese toad has joined that club of clever survivors. South Africans are shocked at the endurance of a toad that got trapped in a cargo shipment from China to Cape Town, after jumping into a porcelain candlestick that was made there. South African officials reportedly planned to put down the creature, fearing it would cause harm as an invasive species if it were let go in the wild. But the toad got a last-minute pardon. Mango Airlines, a South African airline, transported the toad on Friday to Johannesburg for delivery to an animal shelter, after officials decided to find a way to let the toad live. The two-hour flight was a breeze compared to the trip from China, a long way of many weeks and thousands of kilometers across the Indian Ocean. Airline spokesman Hein Kaiser said the toad got ""first-class treatment"", sitting in a transparent plastic container with escort Brett Glasby, an animal welfare inspector. There was even a ceremony, in which the toad's boarding pass was handed to Glasby. ""He was the star of the show on the flight,"" Kaiser said of the amphibious passenger. ""I think every passenger stopped to have a look."" On landing in Johannesburg, the toad was brought out of its container for a celebrity-style photo shoot. Observers said the brown toad seemed like a cool customer. It belongs to the Asian Toad species, which breeds during the monsoon season. It is believed to have survived the trip from China by hardening its skin to prevent it from drying out, and also by slowing its breathing and heart rate--methods that help the species survive in times of drought. ""We've had snakes in imported timber and scorpions in fruit. We were called because the toad was right inside the candlestick, and we had to break it to get it out"" Glasby, the inspector, toldThe Star, a South African newspaper."

All of the following are mentioned in the passage as reasons for studying abroad EXCEPT _ .	Last year, over 206,000 students from the United States studied abroad. Does that number surprise you? These students already know the benefits of studying abroad. You may be wondering why you should study abroad. Here are some answers for you. * Timing The absolutely best time in your life to study abroad is when you are in college. If you miss this opportunity, it's almost impossible for you to do it later in life. * To gain cross-cultural experience Life overseas makes you see your everyday world in a whole new light. You don't even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we view the world and affects us every minute of the day. Differences in culture are more than just differences in language, food, clothing and art. * To improve your communication skills and your self-confidence People who study abroad tend to be willing to take risks, willing to put themselves in unusual situations, and able to solve problems. * To become more fluent in a language or to learn a new language The world market is becoming smaller, and many companies require a second language. Foreign languages are not only valuable in the job market but also valuable in the real world. * For the adventure Travel to other cities within your host country and around neighboring countries. As you get to know your new classmates, roommates, and host family, you will gain a unique view on the host culture. Discover the differences and, more importantly, the many similarities between your worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the program. * To learn more about yourself Find out who you really are. What are your limits? How do you overcome the difficulties you've never _ before? How independent are you? These questions are hard to answer until you are removed from your usual surroundings. After solving difficult problems on your own overseas, you'll find that almost nothing will confuse you at home. Students who study abroad commonly report that their study abroad experience actually changed their lives.	['learning how to get along with people']
Why did John pay the man a lot of money for the bird?	"John sent his mother expensive presents on his mother's birthday every year. He liked to show her how rich he was. ""I must find something wonderful for her, and it must be the only one in the whole world. Then my mother must be very happy."" John thought. He advertised in the newspapers. ""Wanted--the best present for the woman who has everything. "" For many days his telephone did not stop ringing. People phoned him from all over the world. They wanted to sell him ""the best present"". But they did not have anything that was the only one in the whole world. Then less than a week before his mother's birthday, a man came to his office. He was carrying a cage, and in the cage there was a large bird. ""This bird, ""the man said, ""can speak ten languages and sing any pop song. There is no other bird like it in the world. "" ""I will listen to it, ""John said. ""If what you said is true, I will buy the bird from you."" The man spoke to the bird. ""Talk to me in French, "" he said. The bird spoke to him in French. ""Tell me a joke in Japanese, "" he said. The bird told him a joke in Japanese. ""Sing a famous pop song, ""he said. The bird sang a famous pop song. ""I'll buy it, ""John said. ""How much do you want?"" ""One hundred thousand dollars, ""the man said. This was a lot of money but John paid him. Then he sent the bird to his mother with a birthday card. The day after his mother's birthday he phoned her. ""Well, mother, ""he said, ""Is the bird wonderful?"" ""Oh, it was delicious, dear, ""she said."

Which of the following statements is true?	"Bigger-brained birds survive better than their feathered friends with smaller brains, according to a study published on Tuesday. Scientists have suspected that birds with large brains in relation to their body size lived longer because they were able to adapt their behavior to environmental challenges. Now they have provided evidence that it does. ""We have tested the hypothesis that the brain can buffer animals against the environment and help them to survive when they face environmental challenges,"" said Daniel Sol of the Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications in Barcelona, Spain. After comparing death rates, brain size and body mass of 236 species of birds from different regions of the world, Sol and scientists in Britain, Hungary and Canada discovered that the bigger the brain the better. Crows and parrots have the largest brains, while pheasants have a relatively small brain. Earlier studies have shown there is a relationship between the size of the brain and an animal's capacity to create new behavior and adapt more easily. ""The idea is that if you have a big brain, you are more capable of adjusting behavior and responding to environmental changes. This can help you to survive,"" said Sol, who reported the finding in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. Tamas Szekely of the University of Bath in England and a co-author of the report, said birds were ideal to test the hypothesis because they are the only species in which brain size and behavioral response to environmental challenges such as climate and habitat destruction is understood."	['The discovery is now only certain about and mainly limited to birds.']
Why do sharks can find some fish that try to hide themselves?	A predator kills and eats other animals as prey .Sometimes it also becomes food for other predators. Polar bears are the largest of all the land predators. They can run across snow and swim in icy water for hours without rest. Their favorite food is seal. Not all big animals live on small animals. Hippos have heavy bodies and huge mouths. But they don't eat animals. They just eat grass. Some predators use speed to catch their prey. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land. They can run up to 70km an hour. Other predators use their senses to find their food. Sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste. They can also sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies. Some fish try to hide themselves, but with this sixth sense, sharks can always find them. Sharks have smooth bodies. This helps them swim without using lots of energy. They need to save their energy because they never really sleep and never stop hunting. Flying is a useful skill for many predators in the sky. The butcher bird is the most interesting predator. It has a special way of eating its prey. First it kills its prey. Then it hangs it on a fence or in a tree, just like a butcher hangs meat in his shop. Finally, it eats its prey. Some people hunt and kill more animals than any other predator. They not only hunt for food. They also hunt for fun. They kill sharks for their fins, and tigers for skins. Those human hunters are the worst predators on Earth.	"[""Because sharks can sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies""]"
What worried the writer all the way to the dying child ?	"""A child is dying---out of breath!"" I had just begun my working day in the city, when these words came through the radio of the police car I was driving. I turned on the red lights and siren and drove off as fast as I could. ""Just my luck!"" I thought. I didn't know this city well and my first call of the day was a life-and-death sudden happening, several kilometers away. I got to the house. A mother, filled with fear, handed me her baby, his face already blue. Was I too late? Dear me! I did what had been taught to do in such a serious condition. A small thing flew out of the baby's mouth on to the floor. It was a button. Thank heaven! The holes in it let a little air through. A doctor rushed into the room. He had with him an oxygen bag. The child began to cry at the top of his voice, burned red and started to look for his mother. He was angry but was saved."	['He was afraid to come too late to save the child.']
What does the passage mainly talk about?	"Michelle Obama made a daring decision to return to the same designer who created her Inaugural Ball dress four years ago --- and the risk paid off. The First Lady looked extremely attractive in a thin, sweeping, and ruby-colored dress by designer Jason Wu. She teamed the dramatic dress with heels by Jimmy Choo and a diamond ring by Kimberly McDonald. She surprised the fashion establishment by returning to a Wu design which had been the custom made for her. Four years ago at her first Inauguration Ball, Michelle shimmered in an off-white, one-shouldered floor-length dress by the designer. Wu, who was 26 at the time and had only been working in fashion for three years, saw his career take off after the First Lady's surprise decision to wear one of his dresses. He said at the time that he was unaware she had chosen the dress and had been watching at home on his couch and eating pizza when she appeared. After her 2013 decision, Wu told Women's Wear Daily: ""Mrs Obama likes to keep her secrets. She fooled me again."" Wu released a women's clothing and accessories collection at Target last year and continues to be popular with the First Lady for official engagements. The sleeveless, cross-halter neck dress with low-cut back flattered 49-year-old Michelle's arms and neat waist. It had been created especially for her by Wu and was a departure from the dark and plain colour tone she stuck to at earlier inauguration events. Mrs Obama's new hairstyle -- she had bangs cut on her birthday last week had been loosely tousled for the special night. Vice-President Joe Biden's wife Jill also looked attractive in a blue silk dress by Vera Wang at the Inauguration Ball."	"[""Michelle Obama's inaugural ball dress.""]"
The new research comes to the conclusion that high self-esteem _ .	"Everyone has good days and bad days. Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. ""Forget about self-esteem,"" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. ""It's not the important thing."" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: ""There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school."" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help. What to do Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. ""The best therapy is to recognize your faults,"" Vohs says. ""It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on."""	['may not be the key to success']

What may probably be the best title of this passage?	"One of my China Dialogue colleagues in Beijing recently bought a Philips energy-saving light bulb to replace a standard one.He was happy with his choice.It may have cost 30 yuan (just under US$4.50) - ten times the price of a filament bulb - but he wanted to save energy as part of his low-carbon lifestyle.And according to the shopkeeper, he would save, in the long run, much more than the 30 yuan he was spending. Yet only one month later, his expensive light bulb blew up, before he had saved even a small part of the purchase price.Will he stick to his high-cost, low-carbon lifestyle? China's environmental organizations have started to advocate low-carbon lifestyles and the decrease of carbon footprints to help fight against climate change.But they have overlooked one fact: in China, low-carbon living comes at a high cost.It means buying energy-saving bulbs and appliances, and environmentally friendly building materials and daily goods.Cost can no longer be the only standard for purchases.An energy-saving and environmentally friendly product is more expensive than a standard alternative - whether it's a simple light bulb or the house it shines.For average consumers, even buying an ordinary bulb is a huge burden.How can we persuade ordinary people to choose an energy-saving residence? This is not a trend they can afford to follow; perhaps this fashion is only for the rich. Most consumers today do not cause huge carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.Their responsibility lies not in choosing a low-carbon lifestyle today, but in avoiding a high-carbon life in the future.The principle of ""common but differentiated responsibility"" - a basis of sustainable development - can be applied here as well. In China, low-carbon living still is resisted by a lack of social infrastructure . Even if your salary allows you to make that choice, nobody is there to help you accomplish it. Consider energy-saving homes. You need to find out whether or not the developer has used natural materials wherever possible; how effective the insulation(, ) is; and what the green credentials of installed equipment are.You can read up a little, but you'll still be lucky to avoid being puzzled by the developers' marketing.Many so-called energy-saving buildings are nothing of the sort, and some are even more energy-hungry than the average home - as Li Taige warned in his article ""Energy-efficient buildings? Not always"", on China Dialogue last August."	['To learn a low-carbon lifestyle - a promising but difficult purpose']
Thepurposeofbuilding Adam is to _ .	"Robots are common in today's world. They manufacture cars, work in space, explore oceans, clean up oil spills and investigate dangerous environments. And now, scientists at the University of Manchester are using a robot as a laboratory partner. The researchers at the university created the robot in 2009 and named it Adam. Despite the name, Adam is not a humanoid robot. It is about the size of a car. Adam was built to do science and make discoveries. Ross King is the leader of the University of Manchester research team. He says the robot made a discovery about yeast , a kind of fungus used in science as a model for human cells. ""Adam hypothesized certain functions of genes within yeast and experimentally tested these hypothesizes and confirmed them. So it both hypothesized and confirmed new scientific knowledge."" Adam's success as a scientist led to the creation of another robot scientist named Eve. Researchers developed Eve to design and test drugs for tropical and neglected diseases. These diseases kill and infect millions of people each year. Drug development is slow and costly. Experts say it can take more than 10 years and about $1 billion to discover and develop new medicines. Drug manufacturers are unlikely to get their investment money back. So the University of Manchester developed a low-cost test that shows whether or not a chemical is likely to be made into an effective medicine. Mr. King says that other drug testing methods were not very effective. ""How it works conventionally is you use robotics as well and you have a large collection of possible drugs. You test every single compound. And you start at the beginning of your library and continue until the end, and stop. So it's not a very intelligent process. The robotics doesn't learn anything as it goes along, even if it's tested a million compounds, it still doesn't have any expectation of what will happen next when it tests a new compound."" Mr. King says that Eve is different because the robot learns as it tests different compounds. He says the robot is designed to ignore compounds that it thinks unlikely to be good. It will only test the compounds which have a good chance of working. Eve has discovered that a compound known to be effective against cancer might also be used to fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Mr. King says he hopes to completely automate the drug testing process with robots like Eve to create and test new chemicals. But he says humans remain in control of the manufacturing process."

According to the passage, why do people sometimes find foreign music quite unpleasant?	"Our love of music and appreciation of musical harmony is learnt and not based on natural ability, a new study by University of Melbourne researchers has found. The researchers said previous theories about how we appreciate music were based on the physical functions of sound, the ear itself and a born ability to hear harmony. The study shows that musical harmony can be learnt, and it is a matter of training the brain to hear the sounds. So if you thought that the music of some foreign culture (or Jazz) sounded like the crying of cats, it's simply because you haven't learnt to listen by their rules. The researchers used 66 volunteers with a range of musical training and tested their ability to hear combinations of notes to determine if they found the combinations familiar or pleasing. They found that people needed to be familiar with combinations of notes. If they couldn't recognize the notes, they found the notes _ . This finding put an end to centuries of theories claiming that physical functions of the ear determine what we find attractive. The study found that trained musicians were much more sensitive to unpleasant notes than non-musicians. When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock. Depending on their training, a strange chord sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt. To confirm this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly; the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant--regardless of how the chords were played. The question of why some combinations of musical notes are heard as pleasant or unpleasant has long been debated. "" We have shown in this study that for music, beauty is in the brain of the beholder ,"" a researcher said."	['Because they have no idea about how to listen.']
What was the father concerned about before his son flied alone?	Fly Alone for the First Time I began flying lessons at the age of 14; but the Federal Aviation Administration requires you to be 16 before you make flight by yourself. So I had to wait for two long years until I could fly a plane by myself. I used that time to master the basic maneuvers of flying. I learned emergency procedures and practiced hundreds of takeoffs and landings until I could land the airplane smoothly without bouncing it down the runway. It wasn't always easy, and many times I would come home feeling discouraged and thinking maybe everyone was right - I would never learn to fly, but by the next day, I was always eager to try again. On the day of my 16th birthday, I made my first solo flight, which meant I could finally fly alone. The night before, my dad, who was my flight instructor, explained that the winds were forecast to be high. He said if we were in the air by dawn, the winds would probably be calm enough for me to solo. The next morning it was cold, but the sky was completely clear, and the winds were calm. I expected my dad to stay in the plane for at least three takeoffs and landings. But after the first one, he told me to pull off the runway, and he got out of the plane. I was alone. As I climbed higher and higher, the world began to change. Everything on the ground became _ . Houses, cars, and all looked like tiny toys that could fit in the surface of my hand. I made three takeoffs and landings that day. Each landing was perfect. It was one of the happiest days of my life. Today, as a flight instructor, I stand alongside runways watching as my own students take to the sky on their first solo flights. I understand the joy faces, which always bring me back to that day when my dream came true. I learned that no matter how people tell you that you can't do something, if you believe in yourself, you can succeed.	['Whether it would be too windy.']

When he was on vacation, Blake Mycoskie _ .	"In 2006, young businessman Blake Mycoskie went to Argentina on vacation. He went back to America with a business plan that would help thousands of children. While on vacation, Mycoskie saw children who couldn't afford even one pair of shoes. Their feet suffered cuts, and he wanted to help. He noticed the shoes that Argentinean farmers wore. Inspired by those simple shoes with rope bottoms, he had an idea. Mycoskie wanted to give these children the shoes they needed. He gave his new plan a name --- TOMS. For every pair of shoes he sold, he would give a new pair to a needy child. One for one. It was a slap in the face to traditional business practices. How could he make a profit by giving so much away? However, he started selling shoes out of his apartment. When he had sold 10,000 pairs of shoes, he returned to Argentina with 10,000 pairs to give away. Although often taken for granted, shoes play an important role. Children without shoes easily injure their feet. They can catch a disease through soil that could make them sick or slow down their growth. Some children can't attend school without shoes because they are part of the uniform. TOMS, together with other charity organizations, continues to find communities that will get benefit. Since that first ""shoe drop"" in Argentina, TOMS has contributed new shoes to communities in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Mycoskie's special principle is all about giving. This has attracted a lot of media attention, saving money on marketing. When people hear about TOMS' purpose, they buy the shoes and then share the story with a slogan of ""shoes for a better tomorrow""."	['found children suffering from a lack of shoes']
Which of the following is true of women's nurturing nature according to the passage?	"There is one difference between the sexes on which every expert and study agrees: men are more aggressive than women. It shows up in 2-year-olds. It continues through school days and persists into adulthood. It is even constant across cultures. And there is little doubt that it is rooted in biology. If there's a woman's trait which is the same as men's aggressiveness, it's what social scientists refer to as the result of ""education"". Feminists have argued that the caring nature of women is not biological in origin, but rather has been forced into women by a society that wanted to keep them in the home. But the signs that it is at least partly inborn are too numerous to ignore. Just as tiny infant girls respond more readily to human faces, female toddlers learn much faster than males how to pick up nonverbal cues from others. And grown women are far more skilful than men at interpreting facial expressions: A recent study by University of Pennsylvania brain researcher Ruben Gur showed that they easily read emotions such as anger, sadness and fear. The only such emotion men could pick up was disgust. What difference do such differences make in the real world? Among other things, women appear to be somewhat less competitive--or at least competitive in different ways--than men. At the Harvard Law School, for instance, female students enter with qualities just as outstanding as those of their male peers. But they don' t qualify for the well-known Law Review in proper numbers, a fact some school officials owe to women' s discomfort in the incredibly competitive atmosphere. Students of management styles have found fewer differences than they expected between men and women who reach leadership positions, perhaps because many successful women deliberately imitate men. But an analysis by Purdue social psychologist Alice Eagly of 166 studies of leadership style did find one difference: Men tend to be more ""autocratic""-making decisions on their own--while women tend to consult colleagues more often. Studies of behavior in small groups turn up even more differences. Men will typically dominate the discussion, says University of Toronto psychologist Kenneth Dion, spending more time talking and less time listening."	['It is partly biological in origin.']
Lao Yang wrote a lot of stories because _ .	"Lao Yang was born in a small town. He liked reading when he studied at school. He thought the writers were respected and could get a lot of money.

He always remembers he hoped to be a writer when he was young. One day, Xiao Ping, his ten-year-old daughter, came back. She looked worried and didn't eat anything. She said Miss GAO, her Chinese teacher, told them to write a solicit article ""My Father"" that evening. But she did not know what to write. ""That's easy,"" said Lao Yang. ""Let me help you."" Then he sat down to write the solicit article at once. He easily finished it on time. He was sure Miss GAO would like it. But one afternoon he asked his daughter if the article had been chosen to post to the editorial department. ""My teacher said your article digressed from the subject,"" said the girl.

In which part of a newspaper would you most probably read the passage?	"The emotions of the athletes in the prize-awarding moments are often some of the most unforgettable images of the Olympics.Yet, a number of people have noticed some strange things.Yes, the gold medal winner is filled with pride and excitement, which is to be expected.Yet often, it seems the bronze medal winner is happier than the silver medalist.It is strange that the 3rd place contestant might be happier than someone who did better (the 2nd place).How can this be so? ""What if reasoning can help to explain this interesting effect. In order to understand our world and our choices, we often imagine how things could have been different.A wife may ask, "" Would I be happier today if I had married someone else?"" Likewise, a student may think, ""If 1 had chosen another major, maybe I would have a better shot at getting into graduate school."" In short, "" what if thinking allows us to mentally create alternative to our reality. In the Olympics, the ""what ifs"" of the winners are different.Clearly, the ""what ifs"" for the gold medalist involve not being No.1--this thought makes this athlete realize how fortunate he or she is.For the bronze medalist, the ""what ifs"" involve not being on the medal list at all, producing positive feelings.However, for the silver medalist, the ""what ifs"" can easily make the athlete ponder how things could have been different if he or she has won the gold medal (e.g.what if I practiced harder, and what if I had not made the small error in my routine).Thus, the ""what ifs"" that come to mind of the 1st and 3rd place finishers are positive, but the 2nd place finishers have a number of dissatisfying alternatives to reality that can make them feel less happy."

What is the purpose of this article?	If you need glasses to read this, you are among the majority of Chinese students. That's because most students in China are short-sighted which means they can only see things close up and distant things will be _ . Four-fifths of high school students wear glasses and now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. This epidemic of poor eyesight has two very simple causes: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. And because they spend so much time indoors at school and at home, they have less time to spend outdoors enjoying the sun. The sun, as a consequence, is important in developing good eyesight. Exposure to daylight releases a chemical in the eyes that prevents, or at least delays, short-sightedness. According to a study by Ian Morgan of Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about 40 percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. Wearing glasses may not seem like a big deal. For some, wearing glasses can even be an opportunity to make a fashion statement. But poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term consequences. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen and lead to things like macular degeneration , a condition of the eyes for which there is no cure and which can eventually lead to blindness. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break? Try spending a little less time inside and go for a walk in the park, instead. It's the healthy thing to do and your eyes will thank you for it.	"[""To call on people to protect Chinese children's eyesight""]"
What did Duret do shortly after the ambulance came?

He handed the girl to her father, David Anderson, who had dived in after him. ""I didn't think at all,"" Duret told the Daily News. ""It happened very fast. I reacted very fast.

How did the German Chancellor Angela Merkel feel about the tragedy?	"Angry survivors demanded answers on Sunday after a terrible stampede at ""Love Parade 2010"", a music festival in Germany, killed 19 people and left hundreds hurt. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her shock over Saturday's tragedy in the western city of Duisburg. ""This was a very sad day,"" Merkel said. ""We must do everything we can to ensure that something like this never happens again."" Witnesses said that people pushed into the narrow tunnel, the only entrance to the Love Parade festival, from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began as festival-goers began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. The dead included eight foreigners, from Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, China, Bosnia and Spain. More than 340 people were injured. After the panic, a lot of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, could be seen parked on the highway leading to helicopters, could be seen parked on the highway leading to the festival site, carrying away the injured people. The festival itself, however, went on. Police were afraid that ending the music altogether could cause further unrest among the crowd. ""The event was a real mess,"" Patrick Guenter, a 22-year-old baker, said. ""Although the festival was full, they kept letting people in."" he added. ""It seems the organizers didn't plan the route. The road was very narrow, and no one knew what was going on."" Said Taggart Bowen-Gaddy,20,an American from Philadelphia. Officials said 4,000 police officers and 1,000 security guards provided security for the event, which attracted up to 1.4 million people. The authorities had only given organizers permission for 250,000 people to attend. ""I warned one year ago that Duisburg was not a suitable place for the Love Parade. The city is too small and narrow for such events. It is a pity that..."" German police union chief Rainer Wendt told the Bild. The chief organizer, Rainer Schaller, said the popular event would never be held again, ""out of respect for the victims and their families"". First held in Berlin in 1989 just months before the fall of the Wall, the Love Parade is one of the biggest music festivals in Europe. It left Berlin from 2007 onwards after disagreements with the city authorities over security and has been held in several other German cities in recent years."	['Angry and surprised.']
Pace's research into showers shows that _ .	Most of us think that when we step under a shower we're getting clean.We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness .When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body. This is a finding of Norman R.Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US.The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers. Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities.They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium. But Pace said that they pose few threats to the health.Only those with a frail immune system might need to worry. He told the New York Times that the bactertia are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning. But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower.Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than when the water is just turned on.If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months. But Pace had good news too.He has also been testing the air in US subways.Apart from iron particles , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh.The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels . Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places.This kind of knowledge might help _ the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist attack.

Most teams play games in _ .	In almost every big university in the United States football is a favorite sport. American football is not like soccer. Players sometimes kick the ball, but they also throw the ball and run with it. They try to take it to the other end of the field. They have four chances to move the ball ten yards. They can carry it or throw it. If they move it to the end of the field, they receive six points. This is called a touch--down. It is difficult to move the ball. Eleven men on the team try to stop the man who has the ball. If the man does not move the ball ten yards, his team kicks the ball to the other team. Each university wants its team to win. Thousands of people come to watch. They all yell for their favorite team. Young men and women called cheerleaders come on the field to help the people yell more. They dance and jump while they yell. Each team plays ten or eleven games each season. The season begins in September and ends in November. If a team is very good, it may play another game after the season ends. The best teams play again on January 1st, the first day of the New Year. Many people go to see these games and many others watch them on television	['autumn']
When Einstein began his work in America, he asked for some things except _ .	It is well known that Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists of all time and he was also a really great person. Here are some interesting things about him. When Einstein started to work in America, someone asked him what he needed. He said he needed a desk, some paper and a pencil. He also asked for a big waste-paper basket to hold all of his mistakes. This shows that he knew even the cleverest man in the world can only learn by making mistakes. Einstein regarded time as very important. He never wore socks and he thought putting on socks was a waste of time as people already wore shoes. He also thought it was a waste of time remembering things that could quickly be found in a book. That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too. Once in an exam a student asked him why all the questions were the same as last year's. Einstein replied the questions were the same but the answers were different! ,A, B, C, D,,.	['a book']
Despite the noise from the fire alarm, the author still feels happy because _ .	"Every Friday we have a fire alarm test at nine o'clock sharp, and even though the sound is very noisy, I am so happy because when I heard that it reminded me today is Friday and tomorrow is weekend, it is the last working day of the week and I have two days off, it's so excited!Sometimes we have a fire drill, when you hear the fire alarm, everybody have to run out through the fire exit. One Monday at nine o'clock, the alarm was sounded and I was working behind the fish house and didn't hear it. The department manager and staff were looking for me thoroughly, finally they found me and asked me to stop my job and follow them went out. ""I am busy, No problem! You leave, I work."" I said. ""No, this is the law, everybody has to leave."" The manager said. I understood that if I insisted not to leave, they must carry me out. I went out with them together finally, no choice. One afternoon, when I was working outside, the fire alarm cropped up sounding wildly, nobody knew what's happening, some were standing and looking around, some were asking questions, some were running, I knew this wasn't a test or drill, must be a real one. At that moment, one lady called me from a distance:""Jinglebell: leave your job, go out quickly.""I joined the crowded flow of customers and staff going out. I asked somebody what's happened? And they told me this is a real one as there was some smoke on the shop floor.Finally I found out, actually there was no problem, that it was an electrician who used the equipment for the carpet and made a little smoke. After that I asked somebody how to deal with the customer's food in the restaurant in that case, because they went out to leave because of the fire, but hadn't finished their food. They told me that the customers who had bought food or drinks there could get a new one. I don't understand, if in China, under that situation, everybody must carry a bucket or some other water containers to the fire spot, to fight the flames. I agree with the English emphasis the human right, but maybe a very small problem could become a big problem while everybody had withdrawn from the shop, because the fire fighters could not come at once. I was just thinking."	['the noise reminds the author of the coming of weekend']
..Which of the following is a characteristic of a tsunami?	The 9.2magnitude earthquake which caused the tsunami in the Indian Ocean on Boxing Day last year occurred at 7:58 a.m.,95 miles off the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia. Eighteen minutes later.10-metre high waves crashed the ashore along a 500----mile-long stretch of Aceh. Two hours later the tsunami hit Thailand and Malaysia and then Burma, Bangladesh, India,the Maldives,Sri Lanka,Kenya and Somalia.The final death toll is thought to be about 280,000,with tens of thousands more listed as missing.More than l.8 million people lost their homes. *What Is Tsunami? A tsunami is a chain of fast moving waves caused by a sudden strong quake in the ocean.They can be caused by earthquakes,volcanic eruptions ,or even the collision of meteorites .Tsunamis are also incorrectly known as tidal waves,but unlike tidal waves they are not caused by changes in the tides. They are also most common around the edge of the Pacific,where more than half of the world's volcanoes are found.These fast moving waves can attack coastlines,often with little or no warning.Rocks weighing as much as 20 metric tonnes have been pulled from sea walls and carried l 80m inland. *Wave Power Atsunami can have a wavelength in excess of 1 00km and there may be an hour between them.They travel at great speeds across an ocean with hardly any energy losses and are barely noticeable out at sea. Over the deep Pacific Ocean,a tsunami travels at about 800kph.If an earthquake happened in Los Angeles.a tsunami could hit Tokyo quicker than you could fly between the cities by jet. *Strange Animal Behaviors Ten days before giant waves slammed into Sri Lanka and India coastlines,wild and domestic animals seemed to know what was about to happen and fled to safety. Elephants screamed and ran for higher ground. Dogs refused to go outdoors. Zoo animals rushed into their shelters and could not be enticed to come back out.

Which can be the best title for the passage?	"Each year on the first Saturday in March, a group of middle-aged men and a few women gather at sunrise on a beach near prefix = st1 /St. Petersburg,Fla.Above the high-water line are more than 50 small boats. At exactly 7 a.m., Steve Isaac stands at the water's edge with his arm raised and yells: ""Go!"" Most of the boats are part of the Everglades Challenge. They head for a finish line many days and 300 miles to the south, at Key Largo. But this Saturday, for the first time, 10 of the brave mariners--including a journalist, whose progress will be available online--will compete in the world's toughest small boat race, called the Ultimate Florida Challenge. Instead of finishing at Key Largo, the 10 boaters will continue around the state, heading north past Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, and Jacksonville, then down the Suwannee River, eventually passing most of Florida before arriving back at the beach near St. Petersburg. It will be 1,200 miles of head winds and burning sun. But it will also take the challengers through some of the most impressive scenery in North America. The rules are no-nonsense: First one back to the beach wins. The voyage must be completed within a month. Human power or sails, only. No motors. No rides in cars or tows from power boats. No help from family or friends. And at least once a day, participants are required to acknowledge by cell phone or radio that they are still alive. The race will be a replay of the tale of the tortoise and the rabbit. The trick, if there is one, is to be a tortoise and just keep moving forward. But the one-month deadline means that being too much of a tortoise may result in failure. So challengers have to be a little bit of a rabbit, as well."	['Around the coast in 30 days']

It is called the lesula. And it is only the second monkey species discovered in 28 years. Scientists first saw the lesula in June, 2007 in Congo, a country in Africa. The lesula lives in the rain forests. The monkey was first found as a pet in a local family. When researchers found it, the family told them that they caught the monkey in the wild and then kept it as a pet. The scientists have compared the lesula to the owl-faced monkey. The owl-faced monkey gets its name for having a long nose and a face that looks like an owl . The lesula and the owl-faced monkey are similar in size and both have a stripe on their nose. This shows the lesula and the owl-faced monkeys are close relatives, but different species. Scientists say the lesula usually weighs about twelve pounds. It has long blond hair. It eats like a vegetarian . Scientists say it is important to protect African rain forests because there may be other new species like lesula to be discovered in the future.

Mark Twain couldn't make the old man laugh because _ .	"Mark Twain, the famous American writer and a great master of humor, liked to play jokes on others. But once a joke was played on him. One day Mark Twain was invited to give a talk in a small town. At lunch he met a young man, one of his friends. The young man said that he had an uncle with him. He told Mark Twain that his uncle never laughed or smiled, and that nobody and nothing was able to make his uncle smile or laugh. ""You bring your uncle to my talk this evening,"" said Mark Twain. ""I'm sure I can make him laugh."" That evening the young man and his uncle sat in the front. Mark Twain began to speak. He told several funny stories and made everyone in the room laugh. But the man never even smiled. Mark Twain told more funny stories, but the old man still kept quiet. Mark Twain continued to tell his funny stories. Finally he stopped. He was tired and quite disappointed. Some days later, Mark Twain told another friend what had happened."" Oh,"" said his friend, ""I know that man. He's been deaf for years."""

What is the biggest difference between the AeroMobil 3. 0 and other airplanes?	"Finally, the long-awaited flying car is almost here. AeroMobil, a Slovakian company, plans to start selling its creation, the AeroMobil3. 0, in 2017. The company claims on its site that the vehicle ""transforms in seconds from an automobile to an airplane"" by using ""existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes.""The vehicle is petrol-powered and has wings that fold, which allows it to be parked like a car, though it is nearly 20 feet long. The company's website features a video where the AeroMobil 3. 0 drives out of a hangar ( )and goes down a highway, sharing the road with ordinary cars until it arrives at an airstrip. The car then unfolds its wings and takes off from a stretch of grass, rather than a paved tarmac , and flies through the air like any other small airplane. AeroMobil spokesman Stefan Vadocz said his company hasn't decided on an exact price because it's not ready yet.""The prototype is a work in progress,"" he said in an email. But he said the price would be several hundreds of thousands of euros---somewhere in between a sports car and a light sports aircraft. The vehicle seats two people---the pilot and a passenger---and its single propeller is located at the rear of the plane. The company said the car's top speed on the road is at least 99 mph and while flying it is at least 124 mph. It can fly for 435 miles before running out of fuel. It has a steel framework and carbon coating and is powered by a Rotax 912, a four-cylinder aircraft engine from BRP of Austria. Flying cars aren't exactly new. The concept has been around since long before The Jetsons popularized the idea in the 1960s. It has been a regular topic in Popular Science ever since World War I ace, Eddie Rickenbacker, wrote about it in 1924. But getting a practical, reliable flying car off the ground has been a serious challenge. Glenn Curtiss discovered this in 1918 when he developed the Curtiss Autoplane. It turned out to be more of a hopper than a flyer, so it failed to become popular with the public."	['It can take off from a stretch of grass.']
Environment clubs ask students _ .	"In most parts of the world, many students help their school make less pollution. They join in ""environment clubs"". In an environment club, people work together to make our environment clean. Here are things students often do: Turn off the water! Do you know that some toilets can waste twenty to forty tons of water an hour? In a year, that would fill a small water! In environment clubs, students mend those broken toilets. No-car day. On a no-car day, nobody comes to school in a car-not the students and not the teachers. Cars give pollution to our air, so remember: walk, jump, bike or run. Use your legs! It's lots of fun! No-garbage lunches. How much do you throw away after lunch? Environment clubs ask students to bring their lunches in bags that can be used again. Every week they will choose the classes that make the least garbage and report them to the whole school. We love our environment! Let's work together to make it clean!"

How did Chen Hongsheng feel about their help to the poor children?	"How was your Children's Day? What kind of gifts did you get? Eight third graders in some poor places in Hebei Province got new schoolbags as Children's Day gifts. They were very happy. There were pencils, pens, exercise books and many other school supplies in the schoolbags. These schoolbags are from students in Beijing Zhongguancun Fourth Primary School. They are in Class 5, Grade 3. They raised money by themselves. They printed out their writings. Their head teacher Mrs Hou helped them to make books. They sold the books at their school to make 800 yuan. Chen Hongsheng, 9 years old, is one of the students. ""We use 800 yuan to buy eight schoolbags at the post office.

Who probably wrote this article?	"URBANA, ILL. (AP)--Mike dropped out of college to support his pregnant girlfriend and now works as a manager of a trucking company, Lynn graduated with honors from Harvard University and was hired as a lawyer with a top law firm in a major city. What do these two people have in common? Ten years ago they were both high school valedictorians . A University of Illinois study follows the lives of 81 valedictorians and salutatorians who graduated a decade ago from public and private high schools in the state. Tales of Success and Failure The study found tales of success and failure. The research on 46 women and 35 men found that some were doctors and scientists, one was a drug addict, another was a waitress with emotional problems. ""There is a popular idea about people who do well in school doing well in life,"" said Terry Denny, professor of education. Denny conducted the study with Karen Arnold, a former graduate student of Denny' s who is now a professor at Boston College. Denny and Arnold contacted the 81 students before graduation, and then followed up with interviews nearly every other year. They also sent them questionnaires in the mail. Varied Careers One-third of the students are lawyers, or have a doctorate. Nineteen are in business and 15 are engineers or computer scientists. Others include a farmer, a stock broker, and an aerobics instructor. Arnold says many of the students have only average positions in the work world and that ""most are not headed for greatness in their careers."" Denny, however, says that it is too early to make such predictions.

From the passage, we can imagine that people watching a film about the North Pole would probably want _ .	We still don't understand the influence of the mind's power over the body, nor do we understand why there should be such power. All we can say for certain is that the mind does have power over the body in very many different ways. If a man is told that he is at the North Pole and he believes what he is told, he'll show physical signs which suggest that his body is reacting as though he were at the North Pole. He'll go pale and shiver. When the film Lawrence of Arabia was shown, cinema managers around the world reported that the sales of ice cream rocketed. The endless desert scenes had made the moviegoers feel uncomfortably hot. Hypnotists use the power of the mind over the body in order to use their influence. The hypnotist must only convince the patient that something is true, and the patient will act accordingly. If he convinces the patient that his arms are as heavy as lead, then the patient will be unable to lift his arms. If he convinces the patient that a piece of ice is a hot iron and he then touches the patient's skin with the ice, a blister will develop. The body will react to the suggestion and not to the reality, and signs of a real burn will appear.	['a hot drink']
Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?	"The young boy was sitting on the ground in the refugee camp playing with an empty tin.Other children were standing around watching him with envious eyes. Envy? Of an empty tin? This tin was indeed no worthless piece of trash--it was a splendid truck,complete with wheels and grille and floor.The vehicle even had remote control,a frayed piece of string from the""engine""to the hand of the owner. The tin had lost all its original markings.But its first load had probably been sardines .Later the tin had been left with other rubbish behind the refugee camp clinic,and the boy had found it on one of his daily expeditions into the""big world"". For thousands of refugee children,a tin 1ike this rates high on their list of wants.It can be used for many purposes,as jewellery,as a toy,for drinking or as a medicine box.

What made the writer think of his childhood?	"""BANG!"" the door caused a reverberation . It was just standing there, with Father standing on one side, and I on the other side. We were both in great anger. ""Never set foot in this house again!"" stormed Father. With tears welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street. The street lights were shining, causing rather sad-feeling. I wandered aimlessly. A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me. I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and carefree. But now... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because Dad is getting old. We differ in our ways of thinking. He always puts his opinions and codes of behaviour on me. Whenever I do something wrong, he never admits it. We are just like two people coming from two different worlds. It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened. I wandered in the streets, without a destination in mind. My heart was frozen on this hot summer night. As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, until I had only the street lights to keep me company. When I finally reached the high-rise apartment block in which I lived, I saw that the light was still on. I thought to myself: ""Is Father waiting for me, or is he still angry with me?"" In fact, it was nothing. Perhaps, Dad was throwing away some of his old stamps. Perhaps he thought they were useless. I never had the courage to tell him that I liked collecting stamps. I can't stand his outrageous words: ""I can't throw you away, let alone these old papers?"" All the lights were off except Father's. Dad was always like this. Maybe he didn't know how to express himself. After shouting at me, he never showed any mercy or any moments of regret. After an argument he has the habit of creeping up in my sleep and then tucking me underneath the covers. This was how he always was. He has been a leader for so long that telling everyone else what to do has become his second nature. The light was still on. ""Am I wrong?"" I whispered, maybe... With the key in hand, I was as nervous as I had ever been. At last, I decided to open the door. As soon as I opened the door tears ran down my cheeks. I suddenly realized that the iron door that I had imagined between us did not exist at all. Love---is second to none."	['The sight of a father with a child in his arms.']
Which of the following does the dolphin use to help it find its way around?	Dolphins are not fish, but warm-blooded animals. They live in groups, and speak to each other in their own language. In this, they are like other animals, such as bees and birds. But dolphins are very different from almost all land animals. Their brain is nearly the same size as our own, and they live a long time--at least twenty or thirty years. Like some animals, dolphins use sound to help them find their way around. They also make these sounds to talk to each other and to help them find food. We now know they do not use their ears to receive these sounds, but the lower part of the mouth, called the jaw. Strangely, dolphins seem to like man, and for thousands of years there have been stories about the dolphin and its friendship with people. There is a story about sailors in the 19th century. In a dangerous part of the sea off the coast of New Zealand, they learnt to look for a dolphin called Jack. From 1871 to 1903, Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way. Then in 1903 a passenger on a boat called The Penguin shot and wounded Jack. He recovered and for nine years more continued to guide all ships through the area-except for The Penguin. Today, some people continue to kill dolphins, but many countries of the world now protect them and in these places it is against the law to kill them.	['Its mouth.']
The passage is written to _ .	"There is a sign at a Korean university asking tourists not to step into the grass to take photos. The sign is not written in Korean or English; it is written in Chinese. These signs, and signs in other countries warning Chinese tourists about their behavior, have shamed many Chinese who worry about the image of the country. Over 70 million Chinese tourists made overseas trips last year and spent $102 billion, more than the $84 billion spent by American and German tourists. For many Chinese tourists, it was their first trip abroad and they didn't know about foreign ways. And some of these tourists took their bad habits from China with them. Wang Yang, a Chinese deputy prime minister , said, ""They(the tourists) speak loudly in public, carve words or numbers on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red and spit anywhere. It damages the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad influence."" Before you travel to a foreign country, it's important to learn some things about the country and its culture. You are guests in the country and it's important to respect your hosts. As more and more Chinese visit foreign countries, their behavior will certainly change and those shameful signs will, hopefully, disappear."

Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?	"He was driving home one evening, on a country road. Work, in this small community, was as slow as his broken Pontiac. But he never quit looking. Since the factory closed, he'd been unemployed. And with winter approaching, the cold days had finally hit home. It was a lonely road. Very few people had a reason to be on it, unless they were leaving. Most of his friends had left. But he stayed on. After all, he had his root here. It was getting dark, and snow was coming down. He'd better get a move on. Suddenly he saw an old lady on the roadside and obviously needed help. So he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got out. She was worried. No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so. Was he going to hurt her? He looked poor, hungry, and ... dangerous. He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He said, ""I'm here to help you, Ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Joe."" The car had a flat tire. Joe crawled under the car and soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was turning the screws ,she rolled down her window and began talking to him and said she couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. She asked him how much she owed him. Any amount would have been alright with her. She had already imagined all the terrible things that could have happened had he not stopped. Joe never thought twice about the money. This was simply helping someone in need, and God knows there were plenty who had lent him a hand before. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Joe added ""... and think of me."" A few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, and take the chill off. It was a dirty-looking restaurant. Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole scene was unfamiliar to her. The waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. She had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn't erase. The lady noticed that the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude. The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered Joe. After the lady finished her meal, she handed the waitress a $100 bill. When the waitress came back with the change, she found the lady was gone and something written on a napkin. Reading the note, there were tears in her eyes. It said, ""You owe me nothing. I've been there too. Someone once helped me out, like I'm helping you. If you really want to pay me back, don't let the chain of love end with you. That night when she got home from work, she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. With the baby due soon, life would be harder. She knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft, ""Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe."""	['Chain of Love']

Harriet decided to end her marriage with John mainly because .	One day, a slave owner entered a local store and threatened a young boy who was his slave. At first, the slave refused to move and ran for the door. The slave owner reached for a heavy weight. He threw it at his slave. Instead, it hit Harriet on the head. Harriet almost died. For the rest of her life, she carried the mark of a deep wound on her head. Miser Brodas felt he never needed Harriet. He decided to sell her. Harriet thought of a way to prevent this. Each time she was shown to someone who might buy her, she acted as if she were falling asleep. After a while, Mister Brodas gave up the hope of selling Harriet. He sent her back to the fields. At 24 she married a free black man, John Tubman. By then, Harriet was sure she should escape. In 1849, Mister Brodas died. His slaves probably would be sold to further South. John Tubman tried to make Harriet forget about running away. Harriet decided she must end her marriage and that she needed to tell her family that she was leaving. Harriet escaped for Pennsylvania where slavery was banned there. Once she hid under hay that had been cut from the fields. Another time, she wore men's clothing. Finally, she arrived in Pennsylvania. Now that Harriet was free, she didn't forget other slaves in Maryland. During the next ten years, she freed her parents and other family members. She traveled back and forth eighteen times, helping about 300 slaves escape. She became an expert at hiding from slave hunters. At one time, anyone finding Harriet was promised 40,000dollars for catching her--dead or alive. The people she helped called her Moses. She had rescued them from slavery just as the biblical Moses rescued the Jews. After the Civil War began, Harriet started to spy for the North. She also served as a nurse. After four years of bloody fighting, the North won the war. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in 1863. There was no longer any need for Harriet to be Moses.	['he often stopped her running away']
What is the main idea of the article?	Do you know why you sleep? You may think it's because you're tired. Or perhaps you've been told sleep is good for you. Yet no one knows exactly why or how people sleep. Until the early 1950s, most scientists thought the body and brain rested during sleep. Then a scientist watched people sleep. He noticed that during periods of between 5 and 30 minutes each, sleepers' eyes made rapid movements, as if they were watching something. He called these periods REM sleep, for Rapid Eye Movement. Periods when sleepers' eyes did not move he called non-REM sleep. Whenever the scientist woke people during REM sleep, they were having vivid dreams. Measurements showed that sleepers' pulses went up quickly during REM sleep. Their breathing, heartbeat, and the blood going to the brain also increased. Far from being a time of rest, REM sleep is a time when the body is hard at work. Scientists still don't know the reason for this. Some believe REM sleep makes learning easier. Babies spend a lot of time in REM sleep. Because of this, some scientists believe that REM sleep helps the brain grow. Others think REM sleep is a time for the brain to empty the day's garbage. One thing all the scientists agree on is that sleep is necessary. Without enough sleep, people make mistakes. Most major car accidents happen during the early morning hours, when people are sleepiest.	['REM sleep has been watched and recorded by scientists.']

Which of the following might NOT be considered a product made from cocoa beans?	"A study of older men in The Netherlands, known for its delicious chocolate, showed those who ate the same amount of one-third of a chocolate bar every day had lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of death. The researchers say, however, it's too early to conclude that it was the chocolate that led to better health. The men who ate more cocoa products could have eaten other food that made them healthier. Experts also point out that eating too much chocolate can make you fat -- a risk for both heart disease and high blood pressure. ""It's why too early to make recommendations about whether people should eat more cocoa or chocolate,"" said Brian Buijsse, an expert for nutrition at prefix = st1 /WageningenUniversityin The Netherlands, who co-authored the study. Still, the Dutch Study, supported by grants from the Netherlands Prevention Foundation, appears to be the largest so far to document a health effect for cocoa beans.

Researchers examined the eating habits of 470 healthy men who were not taking blood pressure medicine. The men who ate the most products made from cocoa beans -- including cocoa drinks, chocolate bars and chocolate pudding -- had lower blood pressure and a 50 percent lower risk of death.

In the follow-up experiments, the scientists found _ .	"The relationship between exercise and cancer has long both intrigued and puzzled oncologists and exercise physiologists. Exercise is strongly associated with lowered risks for many types of cancer. At the same time, exercise involves biological stress, which typically leads to a short-term increase in inflammation which can contribute to higher risks for many cancers. Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether. To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease. So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run. The scientists then implanted melanoma skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions. They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise. They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work. Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters. So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline. What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice. More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish. With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move."	['how these elements in the runners -- their increased adrenaline, IL-6, and natural killer immune cells fight against tumor']
What can be inferred from the passage?	"A firm handshake could be a sign of a longer life expectancy , according to British researchers. Scientists at the Medical Research Council found that elderly people who could still give a firm handshake and walk at a quick pace were likely to outlive their slower peers. They found simple measures of physical capability like shaking hands, walking, getting up from a chair and balancing on one leg were related to the life expectancy, even after accounting for age, sex and body size. The study is the first to provide a comprehensive view of the existing data from 33 studies. ""These measures have been used in population-based research for quite a long time,"" said Rachel Cooper of the Medical Research Council's Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging. ""They may be useful indicators for subsequent health."" Cooper, whose study appears in the British Medical Journal, said more studies are needed to clarify whether the measures would be helpful to doctors as a screening tool. ""I wouldn't suggest that we roll them out into clinical practice tomorrow, but it is possible that they could be used in the future,"" she told the media. The researchers examined 33 studies involving tens of thousands of people, most of whom were aged over 60 but living in the community rather than in hospital or care homes. The researchers found that those with the strongest hand grasps tended to live longer than those with weak grips. The death rate over the period of the studies for people with weak handshakes was 67 percent higher than for people with a firm grip. The slowest walkers were nearly three times more likely to die during the study period than swifter walkers. The people who were slowest to get up from a chair had about double the death rate compared to the quick risers. ""Those people in the general population who have higher physical capability levels are likely to live longer,"" Cooper said."	['People who walk quickly and shake hands firmly have a lower death rate.']
"The word ""literature"" in the last sentence refers to _ ."	"Generations of Americans have been brought up to believe that a good breakfast is essential to one's life. Eating breakfast at the start of the day, we have been told, and told again, is as necessary as putting gasoline in the family car before starting a trip. But for many people, the thought of food as the first thing in the morning is never a pleasure. So in spite of all the efforts, they still take no breakfast. Between 1977 and 1983, the latest year for which figures could be obtained, the number of people who didn't have breakfast increased by 33%--from 8.8 million to 11.7 million--according to the Chicago-based Market Research Corporation of America. For those who dislike eating breakfast, however, there is some good news. Several studies in the last few years have shown that, for grown-ups especially, there may be nothing wrong with omitting breakfast. ""Going without breakfast does not affect work,"" said Arnold E. Bender, former professor of nutrition at Queen Elizabeth College in London, ""nor does giving people breakfast improve work."" Scientific evidence linking breakfast to better health or better work is surprisingly inadequate, and most of the recent work involves children, not grown-ups. ""The literature,"" says one researcher, Dr Earnest Polite at the University of Texas, ""is poor."""	['written works on a particular subject']
Meat-eating plants can grow in wet and poor soil because they .	"If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. ""But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!"" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink."

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Bissel is a small village of the West Sahara. It lies next to a l.5-square-kilometer oasis , from where three days and nights are generally required to go out of the desert. However, before Ken Levin discovered it in 1926, none of the Bissel villagers had ever walked out of the desert. Reportedly, they were not unwilling to leave this barren land. Many had previously tried but failed, always somehow finding themselves back at the oasis after several days of trying to walk out. When interviewed by Ken Levin, an expert at the British Royal College of Sciences, the villagers explained that no matter which direction they walked it always brought them back to the village.Why couldn't the Bissel villagers walk out of the desert? Levin was very puzzled. He had, by himself, managed to walk north from the village and reach the nearest town in three and a half days. He decided to carry out an experiment to solve the mystery. He and a Bissel villager called Argutel, would walk out of the desert together. They prepared enough water for a half-a-month journey and two camels. But this time Ken Levin didn't bring his compass. Levin would follow Argutel. Ten days later, they had walked for about 500 miles but were still in the desert. On the 11th morning, an oasis came into their view. They were back at Bissel. Levin now understood why the Bissel people couldn't escape the desert. They had no knowledge of the North Star, which had for centuries provided sailors and other travelers with a point of direction. In the desert, if a person goes forward relying only on their senses, they will not be able to travel in a straight line. Rather they will travel in a very large circle and eventually track back to where they began. Levin explained to Argutel the function of the North Star and said, ""As long as you rest in the daytime and walk towards the brightest star at night, you would be able to walk out of the desert."" Argutel did as he was told. Three days later, he came to the edge of the desert. Now in the West Sahara, Bissel has become a bright pearl, where tens of thousands of tourists come every year. Argutel's bronze statue stands in the center of the town. On its base are the words: _ ."	['tourism in Bissel has been greatly developed and improved']
It is probably most difficult for Smarter Child to_.	"To what degree can a computer achieve intelligence?The answer to this question may lie in a newly-developed US computer program called Smarter Child and the Internet. If you ran into Smarter Child online, you would be surprised at this kid's huge memory. It can recite many facts. For example, Smarter Child knows every baseball player in every team this season. He knows every word in the dictionary and the weather in every major city areas across the US. However, if you ask Smarter Child other questions, you get strange answers. A question about Smarter Child's age returns, ""One year, 11 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes, and 47 seconds!"" Asking where he lives gets, ""In a clean room in a high-tech building in California."" Smarter Child uses the vast information on the World Wide Web as his memory bank. To answer questions about spelling, for instance, Smarter Child goes to American Heritage Dictionary online. For the weather, he visits www.intellicast.com. Some scientists believe that by joining the many systems of the Internet, an artificial being with the combined knowledge of, say, Albert Einstein, Richard Nixon and Britney Spears could be born. However, if Smarter Child wants to think and learn on his own like the boy-computer David in the movie A. I. Artificial Intelligence, he must solve two problems. The first is that computers find it difficult to read web pages because the files are sorted in different ways. That's why programmers need to tell Smarter Child where to look for the weather. It would be a much more difficult task to let him find it himself. Another problem is that while Smarter Child can process information more exactly and faster than any human, he lacks common sense--a basic grounding of knowledge that is obvious to any young child."

What style of paintings influenced Mary Cassette most?	Mary Cassette is one of the first great female American painters. She followed her dreams and became an artist. She was born on May 22, 1844, and lived in Europe for several years as a child . Her family returned to the United States and at the age of 16,Mary attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.Four years later she found she couldn't learn any more in Philadelphia,so her parents sent her back to Europe.There she studied the techniques of the masters in Rome,Seville,Antwerp,and Paris. Mary received the chance of a lifetime in 1877 when the famous French painter,Edgar Degas,asked her to join a group of painters that included now--famous artists like Monet and Renoir.Their style of paintings is called Impressionism .They used primary color1s and short brush strokes in their works.They recognized Mary's powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows. Mary painted what she saw:gardens, and portraits,especially of mothers and children in everyday life.One of her paintings,Young Mother and Two Children,was donated to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today. Mary never married and,in 1877,her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her.Mary devoted much of her time to them for the next 1 8 years.Mary painted until 1914 when her failing eyesight made it impossible to continue.She died in 1926 at the age of 82.

From the passage, where may tornadoes come from?	Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms, which can cause deaths and destroy a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time.	['Thunderstorms.']

From the passage, we can learn that _ .	Researchers who study relationships have discovered that a big difference between those who make new friends easily, and those who don't, is that socially successful people tend to make eye contact with their conversation partners much more frequently than those who are less successful socially. In fact, you may be able to become much more socially successful by making this one simple change to your behavior. Most Americans prefer to have a lot of eye contact when they are talking with someone. When a person doesn't make eye contact with them, they tend to think that the person is hiding something or the person doesn't believe in himself/herself. When you are having a conversation and you want to leave a friendly impression, be sure to keep looking at that person frequently while you are talking. If it really bothers you to look directly into another person's eyes, you can gaze generally at, not above, the eyebrow area or the bridge of the nose; this is close enough to the eye region that you will appear to be looking at the person's eyes. But neither the hair or the shoulders have the same effect. Don't stare at other people too intensely, otherwise, you will look aggressive . Keep the majority of your focus on the other person. If you glance around the room too much, or look too frequently at other people, your conversation partner may guess that you are looking around for someone else you would rather talk with. You can lighten your nervousness by smiling more often, nodding, and by gazing at the entire face as well as the eyes. In addition, you can frequently look away for very short periods. When people get the sense that you are really paying attention to them, they will be much more likely to want to have conversations with you!	['looking at a person frequently can give him/her a good impression.']
Middle-aged people may feel subhealthy, because_.	Feeling tired lately? Has a doctor said he can't find anything wrong with you? Perhaps he sent you to a hospital, but all the advanced equipment there shows that there is nothing wrong with you. Then, consider this: you might be in a state of subhealth. Subhealth, also called the third state or gray state, is explained as a borderline state between health and disease. According to the study by the National Health Organization, over 45 percent of subhealthy people are middle-aged or elderly. The percentage is even higher among people who work in management position as well as students around exam time. Symptoms include a lack of energy, depression, slow reactions, sleeplessness, anxiety, and poor memory. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating and aching in the waist and legs. The key to preventing and recovering from subhealth, according to some medical experts, is to form good living habits, alternately work with rest, exercise regularly, and take part in open air activities. As for meals, people are advised to eat less salt and sugar. They should eat more fresh vegetables, fruits and fish because they are rich in nutritional elements-vitamins and trace elements that are important to the body. Nutrition experts point out that it is not good to eat too much at one meal because it may cause unhealthy changes in the digestive tract . They also say that a balanced diet is very helpful in avoiding subhealth.	['they have more pressure in life and work']

What is the main idea of this passage?	Do you think of white when someone talks about a polar bear? In fact, the polar bear does not have white fur. It just appears to be white. Polar bears have a very good sense of smell. It helps them to find food. During summer, polar bears sleep longer, because they are able to find their food more easily at night. Usually, after a meal, polar bears have a short sleep. A polar bear can have 2-3 babies at a time. They live with their mothers until they are about two-and-a-half years old. However, polar bears will die out soon because of people. There are only 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears in the world. The ones that are left are trying to survive today. The number of polar bears is becoming smaller and smaller because of the loss of sea ice-- polar bears mostly inhabit the sea ice, not the land ice.

The spokeswoman thought _ .	"Has anyone been prepared for the possibility that unexpected poor visibility will stop the pilot from landing? If your pilot is forced to turn back only for his lack of passing a certain test, you will be certainly shocked. This very thing happened to the passengers on Flight BE1431 on Thursday. Just minutes before landing on Charles de Gaulle Airport , Paris, the pilot, a very experienced one, told his passengers, ""Unfortunately I'm not qualified to land in Paris for the poor visibility. To do so a level II qualification is required, which I have not gained. We'll have to fly back."" Then, you may guess how the passengers felt about their flight back to the starting airport. A spokeswoman said the pilot was really experienced with more than 30 years flying a number of different passenger aircraft types. ""But he has recently transferred from flying aBQ300 to aBQ400, so hehas to regain his qualification for landing in such conditions as the thick fog he experienced this time,"" she said.

""The whole thing sounds hard to believe. If I had not been on the plane, I would take it as a funny story!""

There was a very large cross through each of my answers. And so it was with everyone else's in our class. What had happened? Everyone was wondering and couldn't wait to get the answer. Very simple, Mr. Whiteson explained. He had made up all that story about the cattytiger. There had never been such an animal. So why none of us noticed that and how could we expect good marks for the incorrect answers? Needless to say, we got very angry. What kind of teacher was this?

According to the passage, now most of the Chinese living in London _ .	"London's Chinese community dates back to the 18th century, when a small number of Chinese sailors moved to the city to work in Lime house, east London. As time went on, other Chinese people came to this area and Lime house began to be known as ""Chinatown"". At the start of the 20th century, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. However, this situation changed greatly after the Second World War. At this time, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs, and decided to move to London. In the 1950s, a small Chinese restaurant opened in central London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful. Suddenly, Chinese restaurants started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much. Most of the new immigrants enjoyed their life and the chances they were offered. Many asked their friends and relatives to join them from their hometowns, and a lot of families were reunited again at this time. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful. The sons and daughters of the first restaurant workers, encouraged by their parents, studied very hard at school and university. And most of them could get highly-paid jobs. As a result, increasing numbers of Chinese families left Chinatown and moved to the more expensive places. Chinatown, however, is still as lively as ever, and a must see place for every visitor to London."	['have highly-paid jobs']

Governments in Yanyuan and the neighboring Yunnan country of Ninglang have joined forces in the rescue efforts and tents, clothes and medicine are badly in need of for the earthquake victims.

Half a century later, Mrs. Cooper became a beloved volunteer at the San Diego Food Bank, where she devoted herself to helping others. She organized and ran a distribution center from a church, helping it become the organization's largest emergency food distribution center in San Diego. She was one of 25 outstanding senior volunteers in the nation selected and invited to Washington D.C. to receive the award. ""She was the main person who helped us make that program grow,"" said Mike Doody, former director of the Food Bank. ""She had a way of getting people to work together and to work hard. She was determined and stubborn, but in a good way. She had a good heart."" People knew her as ""Grandma"" because of her selflessness and her devotion to helping hungry children and families. ""She reminded people of their Grandma."" Doody said. As a widow with a young child in 1979, Mrs. Cooper was helped through a difficult financial time when the Food Bank provided her with groceries. ""She dedicated her life to giving back,"" said her daughter, Monica Cooper. ""She loved life, and she loved people. She was very outgoing, caring and very concerned about our community."" Cooper said it wasn't unusual for a local church to call Mrs. Cooper to ask her to aid a needy family. ""She would give people food out of her cupboard. Sometimes we would cook a meal for a family living out of their car,"" Cooper said. Although Mrs. Cooper was honored to receive the national award for her volunteer work, she said being able to help others was her reward. Mrs. Cooper was confined to a wheelchair in recent years. She died of liver disease and kidney failure this year, aged 93."	['children are what their parents are']
Acording to the passage, we know that _ .	"The Luck of the Irish Look at a map of Britain, and the island on the left is Ireland. It's a small but beautiful country with a long tradition of folk music. Up until 10 years ago just about the only thing that Ireland was famous for was its specialty black beer. Now Ireland is famous around the world for its music with names like ""Kenya"",""U2"" ,""Van Morrison""and more recently ""the Corers"". ""Boyzone"",one of the world's top boy bands ,is from Ireland too.What's more,Boyzone member shane has twin sisters,Adele and Heavy,who are members of ""B Witched"" The ""Boyzone""story is interesting because they were created in 1993 by Dublin nightclub owner John Reynolds.They advertised in newspapers to find members for the group and 300wannabe pop stars applied! Ronan,who was just 17 when he dropped out of school to make his bid for stardom,and shane,who had been working as trained mechanic in his father's garage when he left to join Boyzone,were both lucky enough to be chosen. The other members are shoe-shop attendant stephen lately,former mechanic Mike Graham and one-time clothes store assistant Keith Dully. Many people expect bands that have been created by the music industry to produce boring music which doesn't become popular. Even the boys themselves knew they the would not easily achieve international pop music success. Boyzone quickly proved that they were more than just pretty faces and have sold millions of records around the world.At the moment ,they are not big stars in America,but they say that will change,when they begin a tour of the United States. Ronan will shortly also start recording as a solo artist. That does not mean the band will spilt yet,but we can expect Boyzone to split sometime in the next 18 months or so.Ronan has also recently become involved as one of the managers of new Irish boy band ""West Life"" whose song ""Swear It Again""has recently been Number 1 in the British charts."

The First Lady has started a movement to _ .	More than one-third of adults in the United States are obese .In fact,over obesity has reached such proportions that one big-city mayor has gone about banning large-sized,sugary soft drinks and the First Lady has been on a campaign to control the dietary offerings in public schools. Even many adults who do not fit the clinic definition of obesity are still overweight,and a large percentage are looking for the best ways to lose weight. Reducing pounds largely comes down to the two-sided factors of diet and exercise.Not carrying out the first one enough,and not getting enough of the second one,ends up giving the individual a recipe for being overweight. Advising someone to eat less and exercise more might be the easiest advice possible,but it's also,partially,an oversimplification.Dieting has more to do with the types of food you eat than how much you eat.Reduce the amount of red meat in your diet.If you don't want to eliminate red meat altogether,choose cuts of meat with less fat content.Limit your intake of salt and starches.If you've got to have potato chips alongside your sandwich at lunch,choose the baked potato chips that contain less fat than the deep-fried chips.You might find you're really not sacrificing that much in terms of taste. A diet rich in fruits,vegetables,egg whites,fish and nonfat dairy products will certainly aid in the mission of losing weight.Drink more water and less sugary drinks.If you have to have a soda,a diet soda is a better option,but seltzer is an even better choice than that. It's important--if not always easy--to make sure you get at least some physical activity each and every day.If your feet won't allow for a regular jogging regimen,then make sure you take lots of walks.Next time you need to mail a letter,walk to the mailbox instead of driving.Try to work in a daily walk in your neighborhood.

Hostels are popular among budget travelers because they provide _ .	"One of the main decisions you must make when traveling is deciding where to stay. A good place to stay can often make a holiday. Whether you are looking for a classy hotel or a night under the stars, we can guide you through your different options. Bed and Breakfast An English invention, bed and breakfasts offer exactly what they suggest, a bed for the night and breakfast in the morning. People who hate the anonymity of hotels but want more luxury than a hostel often choose to stay at bed and breakfasts. ""B&B's"", usually someone's private home, are often found in the countryside. Hostels For those traveling on a tight budget, hostels are the best accommodation option. Informal places usually with a friendly youthful vibe , they offer dormitory beds for rent. Bathrooms are usually down the hall. Remember to check reviews by previous guests online before you book your hostel. Couch Surfing An unusual but interesting option, couch surfing is a growing trend among young internationals. The idea is that you become a member of the online couch-surfing community (www. couchsurfing. com) and then when you travel, look up other members in that country and ask to stay on their couch . Most hosts will suggest sightseeing trips and take you out in the evening, making it a great way to see things that aren't in your guidebook. And remember, it may be free but don't forget to offer to buy your host a drink or dinner. Camping Sleeping under the stars! For budget travelers staying at camping grounds is the cheapest way to travel. The drawback is that you have to carry a tent with you. Camping grounds can be found across Europe, America and Australia. However, if you intend on camping in busy cities, check first where the nearest campsite is. More often than not, they are on the outskirts, which can mean lengthy bus rides into town when you want to eat or see the sights."	['a friendly atmosphere']
Which of the following is the best title of the passage?	"According to body language expert Robert Phipps,the way people sleep at night actually determines a lot about the type of personality they have.Phipps has identified four sleeping positions that affect personality. Phipps found that worriers,those who stress the most,tend to sleep in the fetal position.He found that this is the most common bedtime position,with nearly 58 percent of people sleeping on their side with knees up and head down.The more we curl up ,the more comfort we are seeking,according to Phipps. The second most common position is the log.Sleeping with a straight body,with arms at each side,as if they are standing guard at Buckingham Palace,indicates stubbornness,and these people(the 28 percent who sleep this way)often wake up stiffer than when they went to sleep. ""The longer you sleep like this,the more _ your thinking is and you can become inflexible,which means you make things harder for yourself,""according to Phipps. Yearner sleepers are next on the list.About 25 percent of people sleep in this style--on their side with arms stretched out in front,looking as if they are either chasing a dream or perhaps being chased themselves.Yearners are typically their own worst critics,always expecting the best results,explained Phipps.These people often wake up refreshed and eager to face the challenges of the day ahead. Perhaps the most peculiar of sleep styles is the freefaller position.This sleep style makes up 17 percent of the population.They sleep face down with arms stretched out.These people,according to Phipps,feel like they have little control over their life.Not only is this the strangest of sleep styles,but also the least comfortable,and people may wake up feeling tired and have no energy. In conclusion,Phipps has only one more thing to add:""A good night's sleep sets you up for the following day and our sleeping positions can determine how we feel when we wake."""

"Which of the following can be used to explain the meaning of ""fidgeting""?"	Have you eaten too much over the holidays? You should try fidgeting for a while. Those around you might not like it, but scratching (moving your nails against a part of your body) and twitching (moving suddenly and quickly when you don't want to) is an important way of burning up calories . American researchers have found that some people's squirming (continuously turn your body when nervous) and wigging (move in small movements, especially from side to side) equals several miles of slow running each day. The scientists, based at the National Institute of Health's laboratory in Phenix, Arizona, are studying why some people get fat and other stay slim. In one study 177 people each spent 24 hours in a room in the institute where the amount of energy is measured by their oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. By the end of the day, some people had burned up 800 calories in toe-tapping, (moving the front part of your foot up and down) finger-drumming (hitting your fingers continuously and lightly against something hard) and other nervous habits. However, others had burned up only 100 calories. The researchers found that slim women fidget more than fat women, but there was no significant difference in men. Heavy people burn up more energy when they fidget than thin people do.	"[""moving one's body nervously""]"
What does Scuba Adventures do to make sure the divers are safe?	"No one goes on an adventure tour with the thought that he won't make it back alive. It is unclear what Markus Groh thought when he signed up for a late February dive that could put him face-to-face with killer Sharks--without a cage to separate him from the man-eaters. He surely didn't expect to end up dead. But the 49-year-old man from Australia died on February 24 after being bitten on the leg while swimming with the sharks in the Bahamas. Every year, thousands of people die while living life to the fullest-- battling white-water rapids (every year a great number of people go white-water rafting in states like California and Colorado), climbing the world's tallest mountain peak, or descending to the depths of the ocean. The extreme sports are dangerous and you take your chances. Diving with dangerous sharks without a cage appeals to the thrill seekers. The tour , provided by Scuba Adventurers of River Beach, Florida, promoted its dives as great shark expeditions . ""To ensure the best results, we will put fish and fish parts in the water,"" The Scuba Adventures website stated. ""Consequently, there will be food in the water at the same time. Please be aware that these are not 'caged' dives; they are open water experiences. We will have crew members in the water at all times to ensure divers' safety."" Rodney Barreto, chairman of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, maintains there's no way the crew could ensure the safety of the divers. ""That's not a controlled environment, "" Barreto says. In 2001, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission banned the practice of fish feeding off the coast of Florida. Because the tour operator couldn't legally attract sharks with chum in Florida, Groh went to the Bahamas. Barreto says, "" We are not discouraging people from going diving. We are telling them to be responsible and obey the law. One of the reasons why they went to the Bahamas was that they were doing something outside the law."""	['They have crew members in the water.']

The scientists did an experiment with a group of dogs to _ .	"Scientists who try to predict earthquakes have gotten some new helpers recently--animals. That's right, animals. Scientists have begun to understand what farmers have known for thousands of years. Animals often seem to know in advance that an earthquake is coming, and they show their fear by acting in strange ways. Before a Chinese quake in 1975, snakes awoke from their winter sleep early only to freeze to death in the cold air. Cows broke their halters and tried to escape. Chickens refused to enter their cage. All of this unusual behavior, as well as physical changes in the earth, warned Chinese scientists of the coming quake. They moved people away from the danger zone and saved thousands of lives. One task for scientists today is to learn exactly which types of animal behavior predict quakes. It's not an easy job. First of all not every animal reacts to the danger of an earthquake. Just before a California quake in 1977, for example, an Arabian horse became very nervous and tried to break out of his enclosure. The Australian horse next to him, however, remained perfectly calm. It's also difficult at times to tell the difference between normal animal restlessness and ""earthquake nerves"". A zoo keeper once called earthquake researchers to say that his cougar had been acting strangely. It turned out that the cat had an upset stomach. A second task for scientists is to find out exactly what kind of warnings the animals receive. They know that animals sense far more of the world than humans do. Many animals can see, hear, and smell things that people do not even notice. Some can sense tiny changes in air pressure, gravity, or the magnetism of Earth. This extra sense probably helps animals predict quakes. A good example of this occurred with a group of dogs. They were shut in an area that was being shaken by a series of tiny earthquakes. (Several small quakes often come before or after a large one.) Before each quake a low booming sound was heard. Each boom caused the dogs to bark wildly. Then the dogs began to bark during a silent period. A scientist who was recording quakes looked at his machine. It was acting as though there were a loud noise too. The scientist realized that the dogs had reacted to a booming noise. They also sensed the tiny quake that followed it. The machine recorded both, though humans felt and heard nothing. In this case there was a machine to monitor what the dogs were sensing. Many times, however, our machines record nothing extraordinary, even though animals know a quake is coming. The animals might be sensing something we measure but do not recognize as a warning. Discovering what animals sense, and learning how they know it is a danger signal, is a job for future scientists."

One of the approaches through which drug resistance develops is that _ .	"A new U.S.government report says more than two million Americans fall ill each year with drug--resistant bacterial infections ,and 23,000 of them are dying as a result.The head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[CDC]said that the number probably will grow.Officials warn that steps must be taken now to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotic drugs. Without urgent action to stop that trend,warned Tom Frieden whose agency wrote the report,the miracle drugs to fight them won't be available in the future. ""If we are not careful,the medicine chest will be empty when we go there to look for a lifesaving antibiotic for someone with a deadly infection.But if we act now,we can preserve these medications while we continue to work on development of new medicines.""The report names a drug--resistant abuse of gonorrhea ,which causes about one quarter of a million hospitalizations in the United States annually.Of the number at least 1 4,000 result in death. Drug resistance develops through the overuse and inappropriate use of anti--bacterial agents.These can be:doctors prescribing them to patients who have viral infections that are not affected by medicine meant to fight bacteria;patients not taking all of their medicine as prescribed,so the bacteria making them sick are only weakened,not killed;antibiotic use in healthy farm animals to prevent illness and promote growth.Antibiotic remainders left in meat and animal products can then lead to drug resistance in humans. To limit the spread of resistant infections,experts recommend wider use of routine immunizations ,as well as hand--washing in hospitals and other health care facilities.Also,the report urges hand--washing by food handlers. Michael Bell,deputy director of the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion at CDC,said Patients also can play a role in preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics by asking health care providers a few simple questions."

What's the writer's advice to kids who want to cheat in a test?	"At school, besides cheating on a test, a kid might cheat in other ways. They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a ""good reason"" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK. There's an old saying that cheaters never win and winners never cheat. This may sound difficult to understand, because sometimes it seems like cheaters do win--- at least for the moment. However, sooner or later, they'll pay the price. It's just a matter of time only. And kids who don't cheat are true winners because, when they win, they do it honestly."

"The expression ""face the music"" means _ ."	"When someone says, ""Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music,"" it doesn't mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you did not do this or that. Terrible music, indeed, but it has to be faced. At some time or another, every one of us has had to ""face the music"", especially as children. We can remember father's angry voice: ""I want to talk to you!"" And only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was! The phrase ""face the music"" is known to every American, old and young. It is at least one hundred years old. Where did the expression come from? The first explanation came from the American novelist James Fenimore Cooper. He said, in 1851, that expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their clue to go on , they often said, ""It's time to go to face the music."" And that is exactly what they did face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly, or perhaps unfriendly, especially if he forgot his . But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So ""face the music"" came to mean: having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice."

Which of the following would Susie Walton most probably agree with?	"Parents do need to teach their kids financial responsibility and that money is earned. Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why. Susie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. ""Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing."" says Walton. Walton says, ""When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'"" Besides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it. There are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial spirit to think outside of the box to earn money. For parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings. ""I really like having my own money,"" says Kevin, 9. ""It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy."" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old. No matter which allowance route you take in parenthood, kids will feel empowered by being able to handle their own money."	"[""A child's allowance shouldn't be tied to chores.""]"
This passage is anything but a(n) _ .	"Obviously! Until Descartes came along in the seventeenth century, everyone assumed that we exited. Obviously. The fact seemed so mind-blowing obvious that it wasn't really discussed. We could see ourselves in the mirror, we could feel pain and pleasure, we could think thoughts for ourselves and, more importantly, perhaps, all the world's main religions assumed that we do exist. So we exist. No you don't it! You don't exist. That's because it's impossible to show once and for all that you do. There's no proof. You might think you exist-that you are sitting at a table reading this book, for instance-but how could you show with 100 percent certainty that this is true? There's no experiment that could prove it. Although Descartes said just you could prove your own existence by the fact that you are able to think, this isn't actually, according to the British philosopher A. J. Ayer. Just because we know that we are thinking, this doesn't mean that there is a ""you"" doing the thinking. It just shows that the thoughts are happening, not that anyone is having them. Thoughts exists, ""You"" don't. _ ! What a waste of time this question is. Although you can argue until the end of time whether you exist or not, it doesn't get you anywhere. Unless you forget about this unanswerable question, you'll be stuck thinking about it forever, and that isn't of any use to anyone. Move on. Think about something more important! This very roughly, is the view of almost all philosophers, who prefer to answer other, apparently more useful, questions. Yes, but... You exist, but not in the way you might think. According to the great French philosopher Ren Descartes, you can't show that anything exists--apart from your own self. The existence of the entire world can be doubted in one way or another, but the facts you're having thoughts shows that there might be something (that's you) having them. This let Descartes to write the famous philosophical phrase, "" I think before I am""."	['comment']

It can be inferred that robots will be invented _ .	As civilization proceeds in the direction of technology, it passes the point of supplying all the basic essentials of life--food, shelter, clothes and warmth. Then we are faced with a choice between using technology to provide and fulfill needs which have now been regarded as unnecessary or, on the other hand, using technology to reduce the number of hours of work which a man must do in order to earn a given standard of living. In other words, we either raise our standard of living above that necessary for comfort and happiness or we leave it at this level and work shorter hours. I shall take it for granted that mankind has, by that time, chosen the latter alternative. Men will be working shorter and shorter hours in their paid employment. It follows that the housewife will also expect to be able to have more leisure in her life without lowering her standard of living. It also follows that human domestic servants will have completely ceased to exist. Yet the great majority of the housewives will wish to be relieved completely from the routine operations of the home such as scrubbing the floors or the bath of the cooker, or washing the clothes or washing up, or dusting or sweeping, or making beds. By far the most logical step to relieve the housewife of routine is to provide a robot which can be trained to the requirements of a particular home and can be programmed to carry out half a dozen or more standard operations, when switched by the housewife.

From the story we can see _ .	We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong.A day may begin well enough,but suddenly everything seems to get out of control.It seems as if a single unimportant event may cause a number of things to happen.Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time.The telephone rings and this means your troubles are beginning.While you are on the phone,the baby pulls the table-cloth off the table,destroying your half-prepared meal.You hang up hurriedly and attend to your baby.Meanwhile,the meal gets burnt.As if this were not enough to bring you to tears,your husband arrives,unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner. Things can go wrong on a number of people on the road. During the rush hour one evening two cars hit each other and both drivers began to argue.The woman driver behind the two cars happened to be a learner.She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car.This made the driver following her stop suddenly.His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake.As she was thrown forward,the cake went right through the window and landed on the road.Seeing a cake flying through the air,a truck-driver had to stop his truck all of a sudden.The truck was carrying empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the truck on the road.This led to yet another angry argument.Meanwhile,the traffic piled up behind.It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again.In the meanwhile,the truck-driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles.Only two dogs were enjoying themselves from the accident,for they were happily having what was left of the cake.It was just one of those days!

From the story, we can judge the Writer might be _ .	In this voyage I visited my new colony on the island, saw the Spaniards , had the whole story of their lives and of the villains I left there; how at first they treated the poor Spaniards badly,*how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, unired, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were forced to use violence with them; how they gave in to the spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them ---- a history, if it were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part ---- particularly, also, as to their battles with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the Island, and as to the improvement they made upon the Island itself, and how five of them made an attempt upon the main land, and brought away eleven men and five women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty young children on the Island. Here I stayed bout 20 days, left them supplies of all necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, cloths, tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England with me, namely a carpenter and a smith. Besides this, I shared the Island into parts with them, reserved to myself the property of whole but gave them such parts _ as they agreed on; and having settled all things with them and encouraged them not to leave the place, I left them there. From then on I landed the Brazils, from where I sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people to the island; and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being such persons as I found proper for service, or for wives to such as would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting ---- which I afterwards could not perform. And the fellows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for them. I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of them being big with calf, some sheep, and some pigs, which when I came again were considerably increased. But all these things, with an account how 300 Caribbeans came and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but at last a storm destroying most of their enemies' boats, they destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the Island. All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I may perhaps give a further account of the story.	['an adventurer']
The main idea of this passage is to _	If you plan to take your pet on a trip,prepare ahead of time. At least two weeks before you leave,take your pet to a vet. See if he or she is tit for travel and ask if he or she should have any medicine before leaving. The vet may suggest certain pills for sickness or for calming the pet. Some states or foreign countries have health laws that say animals must have certain injections before they can be allowed to enter. Your vet may have this information. You can also get help on the United States and Canadian laws from a book published by the Department of Agriculture which some libraries have. For information on foreign countries, check with their consulates .You can also ask the airlines on which you are travelling. Find out if the places where you plan to stay allow pets because many do not. If you are going by plane or train,ask if pets are allowed. If they are,ask where they will be kept and who will care for them. The big bus lines in this country do not allow pets. Choose your pet's box carefully. Plastic boxes are better than cardboard or wooden ones because they can' be chewed . If going by plane or train during warm weather,try to go in the cooler early morning or evening hours. Also try to avoid very cold winter weather because pets often suffer from cold. Even in your own car, be careful. Do not leave the animal inside with the windows closed because the car may become too hot or too cold.	['give general information about pet travel']
Arthur Gourmand is a name of _ .	"An eight-year-old Arthur Gonzaga from Minas Gerais, Brazil has taken the Internet by a storm, as first reported by TheHuffingtonPost, with his online YouTube series videos ""Arthur Gourmand"". And while it would not be a far stretch of the imagination to assume an 8-year-old's cooking show would be filled with dishes like pizza and burgers, Arthur's show actually features recipes like fruit salad a la creme de passion fruit and filet mignon . The idea to record Arthur's cooking adventures on YouTube was rooted in the young chef's leukemia diagnosis in August 2013.Treatment and recovery for the cancer left the young boy in the hospital for the second half of the year and Aruthur was even forced to spend Christmas Eve in the emergency room of So Paulo's A.C. Camargo Cancer Center. That's when his family--father Renato Gonzaga and stepmother Priscila Inserra--decided that Arthur should create something positive that would distract him from his health. The videos, which are filmed in the kitchen of a friend of the family, are in Portuguese. They show Arthur walking the viewers through a step-by-step process of the entire recipe--from preparation to cooking. Occasionally, viewers can see Arthur's father serving as his son's _ , passing ingredients and following his lead. Fluent in Portuguese or not, viewers can immediately notice Arthur's optimistic and friendly personality. It is perhaps these qualities that have given the young rising Internet star almost 5,000 likes on his Facebook Fan Page. There are currently three videos on YouTube and according to his most recent Facebook post, the young boy will be taking suggestions for his next video. Fortunately, according to what Inserra told TheHuffingtonPost, Arthur is responding well to his treatments and is on his path to recovery. ""The secret of life is to let it take you, to have fun and to know how to turn lemons into lemonade ,"" wrote her family, fittingly, on their most recent Facebook post. Hats off to Arthur, who truly serves as a shining example of how to turn lemons into lemonade."	"[""the boy's cooking show""]"
The author believes that we can easily find a _ .	"Finding a friend doesn't seem like a difficult job. However, bad friends are easier to find than good friends these days. If you're sitting there and wondering if you have a bad friend, let me define it for you. A bad friend is someone whose jealousies and insecurities outweigh their love for someone. They night want to be a good friend but they're too messed up in their own head to ever actually do it. They wonder if their friends are going out without them or if they're being forgotten and left behind. People who are violently insecure don't have what it takes to be the quality of a friend. Bad friends are narcissistic .They look for any opportunity to bring the conversation back to them. Worse, they might not even be aware that they're doing it. In their mind, they might think they are the best friend ever, which is truly frightening. Bad friends are quick-change. They're by your side when you're fun and you have something to give them but as soon as you're going through a difficult time, they will become indifferent quickly. They won't bring you cold medicine. They won't give you a ride to the doctor, everything they do is self-serving. If you find a friend who has these same characteristics, send them to your bad friend list immediately. Your friends are supposed to be the solution to your problems, not the source. I believe your twenties are a time when you need positive and helpful friends. In such a time, friendships aren't easy to maintain like they once were in school. Now we actually have to put work into it, we have to make a conscious effort to keep the friendship going. You need to ask yourself, ""Is this person worth it? Do they treat me like a fool or what?"" if your have doubts, try to make them clear by considering the past experiences. Toxic friendships do nothing but drag you down. My point is that you have to take care of yourself and stop getting in touch with your bad friends. Only surround yourself with people who bring out the best qualities in you. It may sound cruel but it's true,."	['bad friend']
Which of the following is Not true?	"The first English week at our school started on May 4th, 2009. The whole school was filled with an English learning atmosphere. A series of activities was held. There were handwriting activities, story writing, English songs, role playing in English, and so on, all the teachers and students were very happy. They spoke English, sang English songs and enjoyed all the activities. Handwriting was for the students in lower grades. Although most of them couldn't write so well, they were all very careful about it. In the show window, there were a lot of colorful handwritten papers. They copied some articles from books or newspapers. And then they decorated them with pictures in different colors, and some even put their own photos on them. How cute and lovely they looked! Story writing was for students in Grade 7 and Grade 8. These students are always fond of cartoons, so they got interested in this activity. Reading the stories they made up, all the visitors couldn't help speaking highly of them. The most important event was the English show on the last day. The students and teachers presented a lot of English songs and English operas. Each program won storms of _ . One week is not very long, but all the students and teachers learned a lot.

"Which of the following is closest in meaning to the expression ""have all the answers""?"	"One of the requirements of every graduation ceremony speaker is that they offer some advice. Well, get ready, here it comes. Soon you will be leaving the company of those who think they have all the answers -your professors, instructors and counselors-and going out into what we like to call the real world. In time you will meet up with other people who think they have all the answers. These people are called bosses. My advice is: humor them. A little later you'll meet additional people who think they have all the answers. These are called spouses . My advice is: humor them, too. And of all goes well, in a few years you will meet still another group of people who think they have all the answers. These are called children. Humor them. Life will go on, your children will grow up, go to school and someday they could be taking part in a graduation ceremony just like this one. And who knows, the speakers responsible for handing out good advice might be you. Halfway through your speech, the graduate sitting next to your daughter will lean over and ask, ""Who is that woman up there who thinks she has all the answers?"" Well, thanks to the reasonable advice you are hearing today and that I hope you will all pass on, she will be able to say, ""That is my mother. Humor her."""

The main idea of the passage is that _ .	"People who drink moderately , exercise, quit smoking and eat five servings of fruit and vegetables each day live on average 14 years longer than people who adopt none of these behaviors, researchers said on Tuesday. Much evidence has shown these things contribute to healthier and longer lives, but the new study actually quantified their combined effect, the British team said. ""These results may provide further support for the idea that even small differences in lifestyle may make a big difference to health in the population,"" the researchers wrote in the journal PLoS Medicine. Between 1993 and 1997 the researchers questioned 20,000 healthy British men and women about their lifestyles. They also tested every participant's blood to measure vitamin C intake, which shows how much fruit and vegetables people ate. Then they assigned the participants aged 45-79 a score of between 0 and 4, giving one point for each of the healthy behaviours. After allowing for age and other factors that could affect the possibility of dying, the researchers determined people with a score of 0 were four times as likely to have died. Also a person with a health score of 0 had the same risk of dying as someone with a health score of 4 who was 14 years older. The lifestyle change with the biggest benefit was giving up smoking, which led to an 80 percent improvement in health, followed by eating fruits and vegetables. Moderate drinking and keeping active brought the same benefits. With this information, public-health officials should now be better encouraging behavior changes likely to improve the health of middle-aged and older people."

Help Me Hear Foundation was probably set up to _ .	As many as 4 out of every 1,000 infants born today have permanent hearing loss. When parents learn that their child has hearing loss, they are faced with many difficult decisions. These decisions can include choosing therapies and schools, as well as finding financial help for hearing aids or cochlear implants . Help Me Hear Foundation is a public charity that gives the gift of hearing to deaf children from families existing on very low incomes around the world. Help Me Hear Foundation believes that a child's first years of development are critical. Being able to hear is vital to human, and Help Me Hear Foundation seeks to provide a positive lasting impression on society through its programs. Recipients of Help Me Hear Foundation's benefits receive state-of-the-art hearing devices that otherwise would cost thousands of dollars per child over the course of their lifetime. The Foundation raises money through donations for hearing aids and cochlear implants, which saves recipients and their families on average over $50,000 on related expenses. The Foundation tries to be a transparent charity, and wants to be a catalyst for allowing deaf and hearing-impaired children to develop in a typical fashion alongside their peers. Needy families can obtain information on specific services, and find out about deafness education by visiting the Help Me Hear Foundation's website. The website offers helpful information on how hearing aids work, and how hearing aids ease many of the learning and language challenges that hearing-impaired children deal with on a daily basis.

Where did the story happen?	"One Saturday evening, my husband and I went to have dinner at a restaurant. As we sat there eating and sharing conversation, I watched an old woman stop and look around. I looked over at my husband and said, ""She must be lost."" I got up and caught up with her as she walked by our table and touched her lightly on the shoulder. ""Ma'am, are you having trouble finding who you are dining with?"" I asked. She said yes. She was there with her daughter. I asked if her daughter was the only person she was there with, and she replied yes. ""If you stay right here, I will find her and come back and take you to her--to save you some steps,"" I offered. She looked at me and said, ""But you don't know who I am here with."" She was right. I explained that her daughter should be easy to find, because I thought she would be the only lady sitting by herself in the whole restaurant. She agreed...but just then a young man stopped me and asked, ""Is she looking for her seat? They're sitting at a table right across from us."" I told him that she was and thanked him. I watched as they walked off together and kept my eyes on the old woman to make sure that she could see her daughter and all was well. I couldn't help but think that it must not be much different from being lost as a child. I wondered if I too would accept the help from strangers when I was as old as the lost woman."

"We can infer that in the""Back to the Future""movies_."	"Is been a dream for 30 years but now the world's first flying car is set to hit the roads this year. Ever since the""Back to the Future""movies lit up our screens in the 1980s,designers have dreamt of cars that could take to the sky at the push of a button. And now pilots can order their own ""roadable""plane for just PS 127,000. The plane,which has fold-out wings that span 17. 5 ft,has a range of flying distance of 460 miles and can be up to 115 mph.

Why is it difficult to predict the possible effects of electromagnetic fields on an airplane 's computers?	"The biggest danger facing airlines nowadays may not be a terrorist with a gun, but the man with portable computer in business class. In the last 16 years, pilots have reported well over 100 incidents that could have been caused by electromagnetic interference . The source of this interference remains not proved, but increasingly, experts are pointing the blame at portable electronic devices such as portable computers, radio and cassette players and mobile telephones. RTC.A. an organization which advises the aviation ( )industry, has suggested that all airlines ban such devices from being used during ""critical"" stages of flight particularly take-off and landing. Some experts have gone further, calling for a total ban during all flights. Currently , rules on using these devices are left up to individual airlines. And although some air- lines prevent passengers from using such equipment during take-off and landing, most are unwilling to carry out a total ban, given that many passengers want to work during flight. The difficulty is predicting how electromagnetic fields might affect an aircraft's computers. Experts know that portable devices send out radiation which affects those wavelengths which aircraft use for navigation and communication. But, because they have not been able to reproduce these effects in a laboratory, they have no way of knowing whether the interference might be dangerous or not. The fact that aircraft may be fragile to interference raises the risk that terrorists may use radio systems in order to damage navigation equipment. As worrying,though, is the passenger who can 't hear the instructions to turn off his radio because the music's too loud."	['Because research scientists have not been able to produce the same effects in labs.']
From the passage, we understand that _ .	"Like most people, I was brought up to look upon life as a process of getting. It was not until in my late thirties that I made this important discovery: giving-away makes life so much more exciting. You need not worry if you lack money. This is how I experimented with giving-away. If an idea for improving the window display of a neighborhood store flashes to me, I step in and make the suggestion to the storekeeper. One discovery I made about giving-away is that it is almost impossible to give away anything in this world without getting something back, though the return often comes in all unexpected form. One Sunday morning, the local post office delivered an important special delivery letter to my home, though it was addressed to me at my office. I wrote the postmaster a note of appreciation. More than a year later I needed a post-office box for a new business I was starting. I was told at the window that there were no boxes left, and that my name would have to go on a long waiting list. As I was about to leave, the postmaster appeared in the doorway. He had overheard our conversation. ""Wasn't it you that wrote us that letter a year ago about delivering a special delivery to your home?"" I said yes. ""Well, you certainly are going to have a box in this post office if we have to make one for you. You don't know what a letter like that means to us. We usually get nothing but complaints."""

What is the author's attitude towards rickshaws?	"They once seemed more at home on the busy streets of Asia like Delhi, Calcutta and Bangkok but cycle powered rickshaws can now be seen taking people across town in many European cities. Many people believe that rickshaws are a good way of experiencing a city close-up, while also cutting down on traffic jams and pollution. In Berlin, one of the first cities to introduce this new model of transport, more than 200 bike-taxis go along at 15km per hour, past many tourist attractions and city parks. ""It is completely environmentally friendly; we have new models with an engine to help the driver up the hills but they use renewable energy."" said a spokesman for VELOTAXI, the leading rickshaw company which has carried a quarter of a million people this year. While the city still has 7,000 motor-taxis, rickshaw company officials say their taxis' green ideas, speed and safety make them more than just a tourist attraction. While now increasingly out of fashion in Delhi, Berlin people have eagerly accepted the new fleet since their launch in 1997. ""It's better than a taxi, better than a bus, better than the train,"" said ULF Lehman, 36, as he leapt out of a rickshaw near the world famous Brandenburg gate. ""It feels so free."" "" _ ,"" said another traveler. In Amsterdam, driver Peter Jancso said people like to be driven around in his bright yellow rickshaw and pretend to be a queen in a golden carriage. ""I like my passengers to feel important,"" he said as he dropped off another passenger. Another visitor noted how cheap it was compared with a normal taxi. Although increasingly popular in Europe, it is the opposite in India, where hand-pulled rickshaws are considered inhuman and a symbol of India's backward past. Nearly 500 bike-rickshaws are running in London and are not required to pay the city's road tax but things may change as other taxi drivers complain of unfair treatment."

According to the passage, you may be a pessimistic person, if one failure makes you feel _ .	"A 70-year study of personality suggests that pessimism is a risk factor for early death, especially among men. The study results also indicate that pessimism can be linked to increased risk for sudden death from accidents or violence, according to the report published in the March issue ofPsychological Science. Christopher Peterson of the University of Michigan and his colleagues analyzed data from the Terman Life-Cycle Study, which began by studying California public-school children with high IQs in 1921 and followed them through their life. Most of the 1,528 children were teenagers when the study began. Those still living are now in their 80s. In 1936 and 1940, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to obtain information about difficult life events and their effect on overall outlook. One such question was, ""What do you regard as your most serious fault of personality or character?"" Pessimists were defined as fatalistic people who tend to blame themselves when things go wrong and who believe that one bad event can ruin the rest of their life. They also tend to expect bad things to happen to them and feel that they have little or no ability to change their situation. Males were more likely than females to be classified as pessimistic. Compared with individuals with a more cheerful and optimistic outlook, pessimists were more likely to die from accidents and violence (including suicide). A pessimistic personality may lead to poor problem-solving ability, social difficulties and risky decision-making. Taken together, these variables put the pessimist at higher risk of untimely death, say the researchers. Such a person is less likely to avoid or escape potentially dangerous situations, the researchers concluded. ""A pessimistic way of thinking in which people worry too much about bad events, predicts untimely death decades later,"" according to Peterson."	['you cannot change a bad situation.']
What do we know about the new study?	"A recent report found 46% of parents agreed that their child knew more about the Internet than they did. And now new research shows parents are turning to their children for lessons in technology. The new study of around 1,000 parents showed that 67% of parents have asked their teenager children for technology-related advice. 44% have asked their teenager for help using the Internet, and 41% have received teen advice about how to use the TV or home entertainment system. Ahad Surooprajally, a father of five children, says his children help him with technology in the home. ""They've grown up surrounded by technology,"" he explains. ""We have four computers and four iPads in our house. If I want to know something technical they're the ones I go to."" He says his nine-year-old son Habeeb is the only person in the house who really understands the TV. So he tells Habeeb which film he wants to watch and Habeeb connects his mobile phone to the TV. ""You teach your kids everyday life lessons, but the tables are turned when it comes to technology,"" says Ahad. As well as learning how to use technology properly, there is another advantage of parents asking their children to help them understand the digital world. They may be able to get a better understanding of what their kids are doing online. Will Gardner of the charity Childnet International says, ""We have to continuously encourage parents to find out more about what their children are doing online. If the kids are using a social networking site, get them to show you around it if you are not using it already."""	['Over two-thirds of parents turned to their teenagers on tech matters.']
Which of the following is a good habit when listening?	Does this situation seem familiar to you? Your English is progressing well, the grammar is now familiar, the reading comprehension is no problem, you are communicating quite fluently, but: Listening is STILL a problem! First of all, remember that you are not alone. Listening comprehension is probably the most difficult job for almost all learners of English as a foreign language. The most important thing is to listen as often as possible. The first step is to find listening resources. The Internet is really a useful tool for English students. You can download The RealPlayer from RealMedia.com. The RealPlayer allows you to use the Internet like a radio station. Once you have begun to listen on a regular basis, you might still be frustrated by limited understanding. What should you do? Here is some of the advice I give my students: *Accept the fact that you are not going to understand everything. *Stay relaxed when you do not understand -- even if you continue not to understand for a long time. *Do not translate what you hear into your native language. *Listen for the general idea of the conversation. Don't concentrate on detail until you have understood the main ideas. I remember the problems I had in understanding spoken German when I first went to Germany. In the beginning, when I didn't understand a word, I insisted on translating it in my mind. This method usually resulted in confusion. Then, after the first six months, I discovered two very important facts. Firstly, translating creates a _ l between the listener and the speaker. Secondly, most people repeat themselves constantly. By remaining calm, I noticed that -- even if I didn't pay much attention, I could usually understand what the speaker had said.	['Try to get the main ideas.']
Why do people say money talks?	"People often say that money talks. They mean that a person with a lot of money can say how he or she wants things done. But it is not easy to earn enough money to gain this kind of power. Ask anyone in business. They will tell you that it is a jungle out there. The expression probably began because a jungle is filled with wild animals and unknown dangers that threaten people. People in business have to be careful if they are to survive the jungle out there. They must not be led into making bogus investments. Bogus means something that is not real. Nobody is sure how the word got started. But it began to appear in American newspapers in the 1800s. A newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts, said the word came from a criminal whose name was Borghese. Borghese wrote checks to people although he did not have enough money in the bank. After he wrote the checks, he would disappear. So, people who were paid with his checks received nothing. The newspaper said Americans shortened and changed the criminal's name Borghese to Bogus. People trying to earn money must be also aware of the risk of being ripped off. A writer for a magazine said he first saw the expression used in 1971. It was on a sign that a student carried during a protest demonstration at a university. The message on the sign was that the student felt cheated. To be successful, a person in business works hard and tries to get down to brass tacks. This expression means to get to the bottom or the most important part of something. For example, a salesman may talk about his product without saying the price. You get down to brass tacks when you say, ""it sounds good, but how much does it cost?"" Word expert Charles Funk thinks the expression comes from sailors on ships. They clean the bottom of a boat. When they have removed all the dirt, they are down to the copper pieces that hold the ship together.

_ prefers to use the Internet to buy things.	Henry: I find the Internet is very good for shopping. I use more and more for buying books and CDs, and I even bought some clothes over the Internet. The other thing I can do is to book travels over the Internet. I booked a cheap flight once. It was very easy, and it was really good. David: I use the Internet for games. I play chess with people all around the world. Last night I had a game with someone from Japan. I also download games from the Internet, so I can have any game I want. Peter: I use the Internet for anything I need to help me with my schoolwork. I use the online dictionaries, encyclopedias and magazines. It's great because I can download pictures or articles and use them to help my homework. It's very easy to use and it's free, so I like it. Tony: Well, the main thing I use the Internet for is to e-mail. I usually write to my customers by e-mail, and my customers answer me by e-mail, too. We probably send and receive four or five hundred e-mails a month. But of course, I also use e-mails to keep in touch with friends and family. My daughter is in Australia and we send e-mails to each other every day.	['Henry']
Why did the writer tell the old man he was fishing?	"I always avoid going on field investigations with the toxics team, unless it's ly necessary. It's not that I mind the hard work, or am afraid of coming into contact with toxic substances. What I fear is quickly losing hope about the work I do. However, doing field research with the toxic team, all I see and feel is filth---nothing else. Even if I close my eyes, I can smell the smell of food processing, rotting organic waste from paper mills and chemicals from clothing manufacturers. One morning, I went to investigate a discharged pipe to document and collect samples of pollutants secretly being emitted by a textile mill. I had to work with the utmost secrecy in order to avoid being discovered by the textile mill. I dipped a long measuring pole into the large polluting pipe to measure the volume of polluted water being emitted. But the surface of the water, covered in oil and filth, made me feel as if to vomit . All of a sudden, I felt someone hit me on my back, it frightened me so much that I almost fell into the water. I grasped the pole and looked behind me to see an old man standing there. He asked: ""Can you catch fish here?"" I realized that he thought I was holding a fish pole, so I kept calm and said: ""Yes, I heard that there's a kind of small fish living in this water, and it has medicinal benefits."" The old man grew quite curious and replied: ""That may be. If a fish can survive in water as dirty as this, it must have a lot of resistance. So it wouldn't be too strange if such fish had medicinal benefits."" It was clear he was just passing by, so I answered: ""Yeah, survival of the fittest. Fish that adapt can survive, just like us humans."" He kept talking to me and didn't want to leave. He wanted to see whether or not I would catch the small fish with medicinal benefits."

Compared with cases in the U.S., cases in Mexico are _ .	New York City was dealing with a growing public health threat Sunday after tests confirmed that eight students at a private Catholic high school had contracted the same strain( type ) of the swine flu that has ravaged Mexico. Some of the school's students had visited Cancun on a spring break trip two weeks ago. Officials reported 68 U.S. cases of swine flu in five states so far, with the latest in Ohio and New York. Unlike in Mexico, cases in the United State have been mild and U.S. health authorities can't yet explain why. In New York City, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that there were 45 cases, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. About 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School complained of flu-like symptoms; further tests will determine how many of those cases are swine flu. St. Francis is the largest private Catholic high school in the nation, with 2,700 students. The school canceled classes on Monday and Tuesday in response to the outbreak. Bloomberg stressed that the New York cases were mild and many are recovering, but said that some family members of students also had flu symptoms. In Mexico, health officials say a strain of swine flu has killed up to 160 people and sickened over 2,000. New York officials said the flu strain discovered in the patients here is the same strain as in Mexico, though all the New York cases are mild. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A flu viruses. Human cases are uncommon but can occur in people who are around pigs. It also can be spread from person to person. Symptoms include a high fever, body aches, coughing, sore throat and respiratory congestion .	['more severe']

The custom of eating with a fork was _ .	"""Fingers were made before forks."" When a person gives up good manners, put aside knife and fork, and dives into his food, someone is likely to repeat that saying. The fork was an ancient agricultural tool, but for centuries no one thought of eating with it. Not until the eleventh century, when a young lady from Constantinople brought her fork to Italy, did the custom reach Europe. By the fifteenth century the use of the fork was wide-spread in Italy. The English explanation was that Italians were unwilling to eat food touched with fingers, ""seeing all men's fingers are not alike clean. Anyone who used a fork to eat with was laughed at in England for the next hundred years. Not until the late 1600's did using a fork become a common custom."	['brought to Europe from Constantinople']

Which of the following statements is true?	"For several years now, the dollar has fallen lower and lower against other major currencies. Lately, though, the dollar has risen, especially against the Japanese yen and the euro. Some traders think the dollar will continue to rise, but that is not clear. The dollar moved up this week after comments by American officials in support of a strong dollar policy. On Monday, before he left for his last trip as president to Europe, George Bush said: ""A strong dollar is in our nation's interests. It is in the interests of the global economy."" Also Monday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on CNBC television that he would consider intervention to keep the dollar from sliding further. The United States has not intervened in currency markets since two thousand. That year the administration of president Bill Clinton bought euros to support the European currency. But on Tuesday, President Bush said in Slovenia that the ""relative value of economies will end up setting the proper valuation of the dollar."" A weaker dollar helps American exporters. But it means Americans have to pay more for imports and for travel to other countries. Some experts say dollar weakness is the main reason why oil prices have risen so high. Oil is priced in dollars on the world market. But Treasury Secretary Paulson dismissed any link. He noted that since two thousand two, the dollar has fallen about twenty-four percent. But the price of oil has gone up well over five hundred percent. Adding to pressure on the dollar, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet suggested that the E.C.B will raise interest rates next month. European officials are increasingly concerned with inflation. But investors can already get higher rates of return on investments in euros than in dollars. High prices for oil, food and other products have raised inflation concerns worldwide. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the latest increases in energy prices have added to inflation risks. His comments in recent days have suggested that the central bank could stop cutting rates as it has since September. Its rate for overnight loans between banks is currently at two percent. Some market watchers think the Fed could raise rates as early as this month. Finance ministers from nations in the Group of Eight will discuss the dollar and other issues at their meeting this weekend in Osaka, Japan."

According to the passage, most soil insects _	In nature, you may see many insects and animals of different colors. Have you ever wondered why? Locusts are super delicious food for birds,but it is not always an easy job for birds to catch them.It is neither because locusts are good jumpers or runners nor because they are smarter than their enemies. The reason is that the colors of locusts change with the colors of crops . When crops are young,locusts look green. But when autumn comes, locusts change to the yellow and brown color as crops do. Brown bears,tigers and other animals move quietly through forests. They can't be seen easily by their enemies. This is because they have colors similar to the trees. For the same reason, polar bears that live on a land of snow and ice are white. Butterflies and bees living among the flowers are colorful like flowers. Soil insects are mostly dark-colored and they live under the soil in a dark and wet environment. However, insects with colors different from plants can easily be found and eaten by others. So in order to _ they have to hide themselves in the daytime and appear only at night. Have you ever noticed some even stranger acts? The ink fish in the sea can send out some very black ink when it faces danger. As the ink spreads over , its enemies will find themselves suddenly in a dark world. At the same time the ink fish immediately swims away. That is how it keeps itself safe though it is not strong at all.	['do not have bright colors']
Which was forbidden by Mom on Transportation Days?	When my brother and I were young, my mom would take us on Transportation Days. It goes like this: You can't take any means of transportation more than once. We would start from home, walking two blocks to the rail station. We'd take the train into the city center, then a bus, switching to the tram, then maybe a taxi. We always considered taking a horse carriage in the historic district, but we didn't like the way the horses were treated, so we never did. At the end of the day, we took the subway to our closest station, where Mom's friend was waiting to give us a ride home--our first car ride of the day. The good thing about Transportation Days is not only that Mom taught us how to get around. She was born to be multimodal . She understood that depending on cars only was a failure of imagination and, above all, a failure of confidence--the product of a childhood not spent exploring subway tunnels. Once you learn the route map and step with certainty over the gap between the train and the platform, nothing is frightening anymore. New cities are just light-rail lines to be explored. And your personal car, if you have one, becomes just one more tool in the toolbox--and often an inadequate one, limiting both your mobility and your wallet. On Transportation Days, we might stop for lunch on Chestnut Street or buy a new book or toy, but the transportation was the point. First, it was exciting enough to watch the world speed by from the train window. As I got older, my mom helped me unlock the mysteries that would otherwise have paralyzed my first attempts to do it myself: How do I know where to get off? How do I know how much it costs? How do I know when I need tickets, and where to get them? What track, what line, which direction, where's the stop, and will I get wet when we go under the river? I'm writing this right now on an airplane, a means we didn't try on our Transportation Days and, we now know, the dirtiest and most polluting of them all. My flight routed me through Philadelphia. My multimodal mom met me for dinner in the airport. She took a train to meet me.	['Taking the train twice.']

"When the writer says ""He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut"", he means _ ."	"As a teenager in 1972, Bill Gates boasted that he would be a millionaire by the time he was 20. While he did not quite achieve that goal, only 15 years later, he was a millionaire. And by 1992, as head of the Microsoft company, he became the richest man in America with assets of nearly US $ 6.3 billion. Born in Seattle, Washington on 28, October, 1956, Gates was named William Henry after his father and grandfather. From the beginning, he was an extremely energetic and intelligent child. He had read the entire world book encyclopedia by the age of nine. His favorite subjects at school were science and math and his favorite pastime was ""thinking"". Gates first started to play with computers at the age of 13. Before long he became an expert at working the school's computer. After his graduation from secondary school, Gates was accepted by the three top universities in the USA-Princeton, Harvard and Yale. He chose Harvard and began classes there the next autunm, majoring maths. But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls. By 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC. This was not the first program ever created, but its inventors were the first to decide that people who wanted to use it should pay for it. BASIC was a success because until it came along, there had been no efficient way of getting computers to carry out instructions. Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft. His next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980. Today it is the operating system used in more than 14 million personal computers around the world. As chief executive officer of Microsoft, Gates is known as a bright man, but one who is not easily satisfied. He is quick to criticize his staff and hates to be questioned about decisions he has made. He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut until his marriage to Microsoft manager Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994. Yet to many people now, Gates, is a person who is, in spite of his great wealth, humble and ordinary. He spends his money carefully. He eats in fast food restaurants and flies economy class. And when praised for Microsoft's great success, he has been heard to say, ""All we do is put software in a box and if people see it in the stores and like it, they buy it."""

According to the passage, those who try to lose weight _ .	"For many workers trying to lose weight, the weekend is a chance to do some exercise and eat something healthier than a supermarket sandwich at their desk. But some slimmers take a slightly different approach -- consuming more than half their weekly calorie intake from Friday night to Sunday. Away from the daily routine at work that helps them keep control of what they eat, they are snacking and drinking their way to a shocking 10,000 calories, a survey has found. Almost three-quarters of people trying to lose weight admit to over-eating at the weekend. A meal with friends or family, complete with alcohol, as well as a late-night snack before bed, can lead to adults consuming up to 3,500 calories in one day, a survey found. Men typically need 2,500 calories a day and women 2,000 calories. Consuming this amount would see men and women get through half their weekly calorie intake over the course of a 'bad' weekend. Women were found to eat less on a Sunday because of guilt over their consumption over the previous two days. Men had fewer doubts about a third day of excess. The biggest weekend diet danger comes from snacking between meals, the survey found. Some say they will often spend Saturday night in front of the TV with their families -- combining watching their favorite shows with crisps and biscuits. And seven in ten people admitted to having fattening takeaways at weekends, with pizza the most popular. Alcohol is another big factor in weekend bingeing.Around 70 percent still like to have a roast on a Sunday or a big meal with family or friends and a third of those will have second helpings. A spokesman from Forza Supplements, the diet company that conducted the survey, said, ""We all have bad weekends where we have a lot of fun, but dieting goes out of the window."" The 5:2 diet is becoming increasingly popular -- where we limit our calories for five days and allow ourselves a few treats on the other two days. ""For many people, the two days off are Saturday and Sunday but they go way too far"""	['get their efforts to lose weight ruined by over-eating on weekends']
The following are all the measures that companies have adopted to cope with the ageing workforce EXCEPT _ .	"Last month the first baby-boomers turned 60. The enormous generation born between 1946 and 1964 is heading towards retirement. The coming ""demographic cliff"" will see vast numbers of skilled workers disappear from the labor force. The workforce is ageing across the rich world. Within the EU the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 will increase by 25% over the next two decades, while those aged 20 -29 will decrease by 20%. Given that most societies have a tendency to retirement at around 65, companies have a problem of knowledge management, of making sure that the boomers do not leave before they have handed over their expertise along with the office keys and their e-mail address. If you look hard enough, you can find companies that have begun to adapt the workplace to older workers. The tools they use to achieve are flexible working, telecommuting, and so forth. Some companies spend ""a lot of time"" on the ergonomics its factories, making jobs there less tiring. Likewise, for more than a decade, prefix = st1 /Toyota, has been unusually keen to employ older workers. IBM uses its alumni network to recruit retired people for particular projects. But such examples are unusual. A survey in America last month by Ernst & Young found that ""although America foresees a significant workforce shortage as boomers retire, it is not dealing with the issue . "" Why are firms not working harder to keep old employees? Mostly they are not hanging on to older workers the only way to cope with a falling supply of labor. The participation of developing countries in the world economy has increased the overall supply--whatever the local effect of demographics in the rich countries."

According to the passage, which of the following is not true?	New rules and behaviour standards for middle school students came out in March Middle School is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't dye their hair, smoke or drink. The following are some of the new rules. Tell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework. Do more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird-Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it makes it more fun for everyone. Have you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. Be open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth II someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone. Protect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know. Use the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at Web pages that are good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can't you find any good Web sites for children? Here are some: http://kids.eastday.com. http://www.chinakids.net.com http://www.cycnet.com	['Keep some animals to protect them.']
"What does the author mean by saying ""he was a walking library""?"	I liked most of my teachers in college. They were, for the most part, friendly and competent, willing to help students. I liked them--but I don't remember them very well, except for Mr. Jones, my senior English teacher. He was an enthusiastic, sensitive man, who knew his subject and was determined that we would learn it and love it, too. Mr. Jones was a tall, slim man in his midforties. Put precariously on his nose, his glasses gave him a serious look. But they didn't remain there long, for he was always taking them off and polishing them and putting them in his mouth when he thought over a response to a student's question. When he walked into class, he was always carrying two or three books with strips of paper sticking out of them, marking passages he planned to read. I remember, too, the cardigan sweaters--he must have had a dozen of them. On rainy days he substituted a blue raincoat for the sweater. But what I remember best was his smile. When he smiled, his whole face lit up. His smile made you feel good, at ease. Yet though he was friendly with people, he was a bit formal in class, and he could be firm on occasion. He never called us by our first names. He obviously loved his work and liked his students, but he kept his distance. He never deliberately embarrassed a student in front of the class with an ironic remark, but he could communicate his displeasure all right. He'd look steadily at the offending student for a few seconds. That was usually enough, but if it didn't work, he'd say something to the student in a lowered tone of voice. He didn't do this often, though. Mr. Jones' personality and passion made him popular, but what I liked most about him was that he was a fine teacher. Yes, he cared about students, but he cared more about teaching them his subject. And that meant homework, lots of it, and pop quizzes now and then to keep them reading. He lectured occasionally to provide background information whenever we moved on to a new literary period. After a brief glance at his notes, he'd begin to move around as he talked--to the blackboard, to the window, back to the platform. But he preferred discussions. He'd write several questions on the board for the next day's discussion, and he'd expect you to be prepared to discuss them. He directed the discussion, but he didn't control it; he was a good listener and made sure we all had a chance to respond, whether we wanted to or not. If he was pleased with a response, he'd nod his head and smile. Occasionally he'd read a student's essay, praising its good points. But he was toughminded, too, as I suggested before. He really nailed you for careless work or inattention. When you got an A from him, you really felt good, for he wasn't an easy grader. We used to complain about his grading standards, usually in vain, though he would change a grade if he thought the had been unfair. We had many interesting discussions about Twain, Crane, and Dreiser, as I recall, but his favorite period was the 1920's. He loved the expatriates : Anderson, Cummings, Hemingway, Fitzgerald. He was always bringing in books for us to read, but when he got to this period, he was a walking library, I think he'd read every book ever written by or about Hemingway and Fitzgerald in the twenties. Yes, Mr. Jones was a fine teacher all right: he knew his subject. But more than that, he made us want to continue to read it and study it on our own.

What is the author's purpose of telling the story about the English bank?	We Americans are wasteful people, not used to saving. The frontiersmen began this pattern, for natural resources were so plentiful that no one ever imagined a shortage, within a few years of the first Virginia settlement, for example, pioneers burned down their houses when they were ready to move west. They wanted to have the nails for future use. No one ever gave a thought to the priceless hardwoods that went up in smoke. As a people,we destroy many things that other people save. I noticed a letter from one of England's largest banks. It was enclosed in a used envelope that had been readdressed to me. Such a practice would be unthinkable in the United States. American banks, even the smallest, always use expensive stationery with the names of all twenty-eight vice-presidents listed on one side of the page.

Which of the following statements is RIGHT?	"My grandmother often said to me, ""You can count the number of your true friends on the fingers of one hand."" For a long time I thought this was true. However, I've now discovered my grandmother was only half right. Maybe we do only make a few ""best"" friends in our lifetime, but those aren't the only people that we can call friends. There are many different types. Let me tell you about a few of them. One type of friends is the type I call the ""football mom friend"". My neighbor Sally is a good example. We both have kids who play football in a football club, and someone has to take them to practice and pick them up. Sally and I and two other mothers take turns to do this. We meet sometimes and have tea and talk about what our kids are doing, but those are the only times that we meet each other. I enjoy being with these women, but we don't do anything else together. Another type is called the ""hobby friend"". That's the person you share an interest or a hobby with. Michael and Cater, who are brothers, are a good example of this type. We're all in a bird watching club. Every few weekends the members of the club go on a trip to watch different kinds of birds. There's nothing romantic about my relationship with Michael and Cater, of course. We just share interest in birds. Then there's the ""other half of the couple"" type of friends. Jim is married to Rose, a friend that I've known since college. When Rose married Jim, I realized that I would have to be Jim's friend if I want to continue to be Rose's. Jim and I don't share so many interests, but we do have a friendly relationship."	['The writer herself sometimes takes her kid to the football club.']
The passage mainly tells us _ .	"XUE Bai, a 21-year-old university student, hopes to volunteer for Beijing's 2008 Olympics. ""I want to do something for the Olympics. It is also a kind of learning for me,"" said the fourth-year student at Beijing Foreign Studies University. Now it is time for Xue to act on her plan. The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the 2008 Olympiad will start to recruit volunteers on August 28. The Olympics will need around 70,000 volunteers and the Paralympic Games will need another 30,000. University students like Xue will make up the majority of the volunteers. But the Olympics also need other volunteers - ordinary citizens and foreigners, for example. Students in Beijing should apply through their universities. Other volunteers may apply online or submit a written application. The online application system and a hotline will be open next Monday. For applicants outside Beijing, the application process begins in December. There is plenty of work for volunteers to do. For example, there will be chances to help publicize the games over the next two years. During the games themselves, volunteers will clean, serve food, marshal or offer language help. The Sydney Olympics in 2000 was the first that placed special emphasis on the role of volunteers. It used more than 45,000 volunteers in different roles. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, around 45,000 volunteers were used. More than 70,000 volunteers will be needed for the Olympic games and Paralympic Games in 2012, the London Olympic Organizing Committee has said."	['volunteers for the 2008 Olympics are wanted.']
The author's attitude towards found photographs can be described as _ .	"Photos that you might have found down the back of your sofa are now big business! In 2005, the American artist Richard Prince's photograph of a photograph, Untitled (Cowboy), was sold for $ 1, 248, 000. Prince is certainly not the only contemporary artist to have worked with so-called ""found photographs""--a loose term given to everything from discarded prints discovered in a junk shop to old advertisements or amateur photographs from a stranger's family album. The German artist Joachim Schmid, who believes ""basically everything is worth looking at"", has gathered discarded photographs, postcards and newspaper images since 1982. In his on-going project, Archiv, he groups photographs of family life according to themes: people with dogs; teams; new cars; dinner with the family; and so on. Like Schmid, the editors of several self-published art magazines also champion found photographs. One of _ , called simply Found, was born one snowy night in Chicago, when Davy Rothbard returned to his car to find under his wiper an angry note intended for some else: ""Why's your car HERE at HER place?"" The note became the starting point for Rothbard's addictive publication, which features found photographs sent in by readers, such a poster discovered in our drawer. The whole found-photograph phenomenon has raised some questions. Perhaps one of the most difficult is: can these images really be considered as art? And if so, whose art? Yet found photographs produced by artists, such Richard Prince, may riding his horse hurriedly to meet someone? Or how did Prince create this photograph? It's anyone's guess. In addition, as we imagine the back-story to the people in the found photographs artists, like Schmid, have collated , we also turn toward our own photographic albums. Why is memory so important to us? Why do we all seek to freeze in time the faces of our children, our parents, our lovers, and ourselves? Will they mean anything to anyone after we've gone? In the absence of established facts, the vast collections of found photographs give our minds an opportunity to wander freely. That, above all, is why they are so fascinating."	['optimistic']
The boy's father allowed the boy to drive the car to Mijas because _ .	"I grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona. I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced(,) at a nearby garage. Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late! I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me. ""I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason."" ""What do you mean? I'm telling the truth."" Dad looked at me again. ""When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car."" A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theatre and the real reason for my being late. Dad listened intently as a sadness passed through him. ""I'm angry, not with you but with myself. You see, I realize that I have failed as a father if after all these years you feel that you have to lie to me. I have failed because I have brought up a son who cannot even tell the truth to his own father. I'm going to walk home now and think seriously about where I have gone wrong all these years."" ""But Dad, it's 18 miles to home. It's dark. You can't walk home."" My protests and my apologies were useless. I had let my father down and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life. Dad began walking along the dusty road. I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would weaken. I begged all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he simply ignored me, continuing on silently, thoughtfully and painfully. For 18 miles I drove behind him, at a speed of about five miles per hour. Seeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing and painful experience that I have ever faced. However, it was also the most successful lesson. I have never lied to him since."	['he would take the car to be serviced at a nearby garage']
The way to pick out the items on the first list from the second is known as _ .	"Memory is the ability to keep track of things that have happened in the past. Memory really is learning. One needs memory to ride a bicycle. A dog needs to remember if it is to come when called. Memory is said to be stored in the brain as a ""memory trace ."" What makes up this trace is not known. Some scientists believe that certain chemical substances may carry certain memories. For example, one substance, when given to rats, causes them to fear the dark. Other research into memory has to do with how the brain works. Psychologists use three means to find out how a person remembers. For example, give a person a grocery list. Let the person memorize the list, then put it away. The most natural way to find out how much a person remembers of the grocery list is to ask what he or she remembers. This is called the method of recall. Another method is called recognition. Give the person another grocery list. Ask him or her to choose items on the first list from the items that are on only the second list. Often a person will be able to recognize things that he or she cannot recall. A third method of finding how much a person remembers is called relearning. Here the person is asked to read over the first list. The person will probably learn the list the second time faster than he did the first time. The difference in the time it takes to relearn the list is thought of as a measure of how much a person has remembered. One way of remembering something is to repeat it many times. Interest is very important. Boring lists of facts are much more difficult to remember than something that we understand and are interested in. Motivation, or wanting to do something, is also important. Motivation is linked with reward. For example, a hungry animal quickly learns how to do something if that action gets the animal food. In humans, wanting to learn is often motivation. The praise of a teacher or the knowledge that an answer is correct is rewarding."	['recognition']
The best title foe this passage is _ .	My name is Christopher. My family came to America before I was born . In two weeks I am going to be married , and my Fiance'e , Samantha, and expect to be very happy. We do not plan to have honeymoon because we want to spend two weeks setting up our own new business as real estate agents . My mother , who is very traditional , says that our plans are unreasonable. She thinks that we should just spend two weeks on a holiday in the Caribbean . In her days , and in the old country , young couples didn't start business together. Instead the man went out to work , and the wife stayed home to raise a family. Both Samantha and I want children in the future , and together we plan to raise them . Needless to say, our plans and my mother's views don't agree . I suppose it's hard for my mother and father to understand our point of view. They are used to another way of setting up a marriage and a life. Another thing that worries my parents is the fact that Samantha and I are going to be spending seven days a week on our business until it is running smoothly. As my mother has pointed out to us, such a timetable will leave us little time for socializing or for a night in the town. My mother says a young couple should enjoy themselves and get to know each other under less exciting conditions. Actually. Samantha and I know each other pretty well. We both work hard for our goals, and neither of us minds giving up weekends for a while. We are young and enthusiastic .	"[""Christopher and Samantha's Marriage""]"
It can be concluded from the passage that _ .	"Just as the English language has changed quickly in the previous century, so has the use of it. After the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was founded in 1927, the particular style of speech of the BBC announcers was recognized as standard English or Received Pronunciation (RP) English. Now, most people still consider that the pronunciation and delivery of BBC announcers is the clearest and most understandable spoken English. English has had a strong relationship with classes and social positions. However, since the Second World War there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery , and marks of class distinction such as styles of speech have been gradually diminishing, especially in the younger generation. By the end of the 1960s, it had become clear that it was not necessary to speak standard English or even correct grammar to become popular, successful and rich. The fashionable speech of the day was no longer the special right of a special class but rather a defiant expression of classlessness. The greatest single influence of the shaping of the English language in modern times is the American English. Over the last 25 years the English used by many people, particularly by those in the media, advertising and show business, has become more and more mid-Atlantic in style, delivery and accent. In the 1970s, fashion favored careless pronunciation and a language full of jargon, slang and ""in"" words, a great quantity of which couldn't be understood by the outside world. What is considered modern and fashionable in Britain today is often not the kind of English taught in schools and colleges."

Which of the following best describes Kenny's cooking?	"Feeding a crowd of hundreds doesn't make Kenny Seals-Nutt nervous. In fact, he _ in the kitchen. He's in his perfect place when dicing tomatoes, making salads and baking cakes. By the time Kenny, 16, reached his third year of high school at Hickory Grove, North Carolina, US, he had become vice president of his school's cooking club. He also opened his own food company, called Modern Fusion. Kenny said he developed his love of cooking by watching his mother, and his grandmother, who owned a catering business herself. Kenny helped them both in order to remember their tips: how long to cook chicken so it stays wet, and the right amount of tomatoes to add to a spaghetti dish. At the age of 5, he cooked his first dish of shrimp and broccoli. Taking it for his school lunch, he warmed it up in the school's microwave, while the other kids ate their sandwiches. ""I love to eat, and it started to become more fun to cook than to use a microwave,"" he said. Cooking came easy to Kenny, and he enjoyed adding new ingredients into common dishes. ""It started with a passion and I wanted to know more,"" he said. He began to watch the Food Network and read chef blogs. Last summer, Kenny put his skills to the test by working with his grandmother to cater his uncle's wedding. While she cooked traditional dishes, Kenny wanted to add new to the expected flavors . Now Kenny spends his weekends catering his own events: weddings, birthday parties, baby showers. Kenny's dishes are always a hit. Chef Frederick Mookie Hicks, owner of a catering business, said Kenny's success comes from his ability to multitask in the kitchen. Hicks said he has asked Kenny to cook with him on jobs three times now, and he presents Kenny as a positive example of a passionate chef to the students in his cooking classes. ""He's so vigorous about cooking that he doesn't let anything stop him,"" Hicks said. ""I knew in the first five minutes of working with the kid that he is something special."""	['Creative.']

Which of the following can be the best title for this passage?	"It was late on a snowing night. Doctor Van was driving fast to the hospital to do an operation on a badly hurt person. Minutes later he came to a red traffic light and had to stop to wait. A man suddenly opened the door of the car and got in. ""Drive on, "" shouted the man, ""Just do what I've told you to.

Who is the book, Be Happy at Work, written for?	"""Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, ""There are no happy jobs, only happy workers."" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics. First, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, ""My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'"" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys. Second, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, ""I work with the coolest people in the world."" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, ""There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying."" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people. Third, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, ""Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous."" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work."	['People who do not feel satisfied with their jobs.']
What can we learn about the author?	I come from a city on the United States'east coast. It's a ten-hour flight for me to get home from Shanghai. When I got off the plane, I took photos of the blue sky and white clouds along the way. After two weeks, I returned to Shanghai. Much to my surprise, the blue sky in Shanghai that I liked before was not as blue as that in the US. I couldn't help wondering what had happened. A few days later, I went to tour Waitan (a famous tourist attraction in Shanghai) by the Huangpu River with some of my friends. There we saw five Ferrari sports cars by the side of the road. The red and yellow cars looked so nice that everyone was looking at them. However, when I turned my head, I noticed the sky over Waitan, I was shocked to find that the buildings in the Lujiazui area on the other side of Huangpu River could hardly be seen. It was then that I realized that Ferrari cars could be bought with money, but a blue sky couldn't. Shanghai is an important economic and trade center in China. It has made great contributions to the whole nation's economic development. However, we need to protect the environment during economic growth. Pollution is poisoning our air and our rivers. Without clean air and rivers, how will people be able to survive?	['He is socially responsible  .']

Which of these sentences best describes the current situation at NASA?	"Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, has died at the age of 82. Many people paid tribute to the former astronaut. But other people feel regret that no human has been back to the moon since 1972, just three years after Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous ""giant leap for mankind"" speech. Elliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, like in the 1960s, during the moon landings programme, when astronauts went to the moon. ""In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,"" he said. Armstrong died because of heart problems after surgery. His recovery seemed to be going well, and his death was a surprise to many people. His family described him as a ""reluctant American hero"" and said: ""Honour his example of service, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink."" Speaking from the White House, Barack Obama said Armstrong was ""among the greatest of American heroes - not just of his time, but of all time"". He added: ""And when Neil stepped on the moon for the first time, it was a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten."" Buzz Aldrin flew with Armstrong on Apollo 11. He was the second man to walk on the moon. He said he was very sad at the death of his good friend and companion. ""When I look at the moon I remember that special moment, over forty years ago, when Neil and I stood on the moon,"" he said. ""Looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth hanging in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from Earth than two humans had ever been, we were not alone. Almost the entire world took that memorable journey with us. I know many millions of people around the world will join me in mourning the death of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will always be remembered as a historic moment in human history."" In the US, people felt that he represented the achievement of a past age of American greatness. Today, things are very different: NASA has cancelled a number of missions because they don't have enough money. Former astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man on the moon, said: ""Neil did something that people thought was impossible."" Others complained about the state of the US. Journalist Andrew Pasternak wrote: ""It will take longer to rebuild lower Manhattan after 9/11 than it took to build an entire space program and send a man to the moon."" Of course, NASA has its modern successes. Its engineers have landed a nuclear-powered robot on Mars. There will also be another Mars mission. It will drill below the planet's surface. But these achievements are not as exciting as Armstrong's. NASA administrator Charles Bolden expressed that in his tribute. ""As we enter this next era of space exploration, we are standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong,"" he said. Armstrong was disappointed by what NASA has become. Blogger Eric Berger saw an email from Armstrong and other former astronauts. It expressed frustration at the current problems at NASA and quoted Yogi Berra, an American baseball legend: ""If you don't know where you are going, you might not get there."""

We can infer from Pereira's word that _	"WASHINGTON(Reuters)-People who drink two or more sweetened soft drinks a week have a much higher risk of pancreatic cancer , an unusual but deadly cancer, researchers reported on Monday. People who drank mostly fruit juice instead of sodas did not have the same risk, the study of 60,000 people in Singapore found. ""Sugar may be to blame but people who drink sweetened sodas regularly often have other poor health habits,"" said Mark Pereira of the University of Minnesota, who led the study. ""The high levels of sugar in soft drinks may be increasing the level of insulin in the body, which we think contributes to pancreatic cancer cell growth,"" President said in a statement. Writing in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, Pereira and his colleagues said they followed 60,524 men and women in the Singapore--Chinese Health Study for 14 years. Over that time, 140 of the volunteers developed pancreatic cancer. Those who drank two or more sweetened soft drinks a week had an 87 percent higher risk of being among those who got pancreatic cancer. Pereira said he believed the findings would apply elsewhere. ""Singapore is a wealthy country with excellent healthcare. Favorite pastimes are eating and shopping, so the findings should apply to other western countries."" he said. But Susan Mayne of the Yale Cancer Center at Yale University in Connecticut was cautious. ""Although this study found a risk, the finding was based on a relatively small number of cases and it remains unclear whether it was a causal connection or not."" Said Mayne, who serves on thee board of the journal, which is published by the American Association for Cancer Research. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest form of cancer, with 230,000 cases globally. In the United States, 37,680 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in a year and 34, 290 die of it."

At Burlington High in suburban Boston, Principal Patrick Larkin says the $500 iPads is better than textbooks in the long term, though he said the school will still use traditional texts in some courses if suitable electronic programs aren't yet available."" Lark/n said of textbooks, ""but But some experts warn that the districts need to ensure they can support the wireless infrastructure , repairs and other costs that accompany a switch to such a tech-heavy approach. Mark Warschauer, an education and informatics professor said, ""I think people will like it. I really don't know anybody in high school that wouldn't want to get an iPad,"" he said. ""We're always using technology at home, then when you're at school it's textbooks.so it's a good way to put all of that together."" Districts are varied in their policies on how they police students' use. And the nation's textbook publishing industry, accounting for $ 5.5 billion in yearly sales to secondary schools, is taking notice of the trend with its own shift in a competitive race toward developing curriculum specifically for iPads. Jay Diskey, executive director of the Association of American Publishers' schools division, said all of the major textbook publishers are moving toward electronic offerings, but at least in the short term, traditional bound textbooks are here to stay.""I think one of the real key questions that will be answered over the next several years is what sort of things work best in print for students and what smt of things work best digitally, """	['The iPads may be unavailable for some traditional courses.']
How many kinds of shops or stores on the lower East Side are mentioned in the passage?	The lower East Side is neither rich nor beautiful, but it can be a good place to shop. On Sundays, its streets are crowded with visitors and shoppers like these. They are trying to find a coat or a pair of shoes at a good price. Most people prefer to shop in the big department stores like Macy's, Gimbel's, or Bloomingdale's because there they can find clothing, furniture, toys, and food in one store. Some people like the smaller stores of Greenwich Village or other areas when they are looking for an unusual present. Some streets have only one kind of stores. Bracelets and rings shine in the windows of Canal Street, and wedding dresses fill the stores of Grant Street. There are streets for furs, and, in one area, there are 600 shops for antiques! Fifth Avenue is the most famous place to shop, and it is usually the most expensive. There you can find the latest styles from Paris, Italy, or New York. You can spend thousands of dollars on Fifth Avenue, or you can just _ and admire the sights for free.	['Four.']
According to the passage, Lewis followed the stupid kid in order to _ .	That year, in the local school, there was a new math teacher, as well as some new pupils. One of the new kids was the stupidest child that anyone had ever seen. It made no difference how quickly or how slowly they tried explaining numbers to him; he would always end up saying something enormously stupid. Like two plus two was five, seven times three was twenty-seven, or a triangle had thirty corners... Before this boy arrived, math lessons had been the most boring of all. Now they were great fun. Encouraged by the new teacher, the children would listen to the pieces of nonsense spouted by the new kid, and they would have to correct his mistakes. Whenever the new teacher asked questions, the stupid kid would stand up but made the wrong answers, the other students all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then think up the most original ways to explain them. To do this they used all kinds of stuff: sweets, playing cards, oranges, paper planes, etc. It didn't seem like any of _ bothered the new kid. However,little Lewis was sure that it was bound to make him feel sad inside. Lewis was sure he would see him crying. So,one day, he decided to follow the new kid home after school. On leaving school, the new kid walked a few minutes to a local park, and there he waited for a while, until someone came along to meet him... It was the new teacher!

What enable children to develop both their judgment and their sense of responsibility?	"Since Amy Chua took the world of Chinese parents by storm with her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, in 2011 it seems more Chinese mothers have turned into ""tiger moms"". Several young Chinese mothers are my friends. But rarely any of them is free for lunch or other activities, because they appear to have become their children's ""slaves"". One of these young mothers moved from Hebei province to Beijing just to get her daughter admitted to a private and very expensive kindergarten. She closed her booming business and her husband shifted his office to Beijing, where they have bought a house. Another young mother is divorced and always busy with her daughter's dance, piano or English class. And a couple, both professionals in high positions, left their jobs, sold their Beijing house and moved to Australia when their son started going to school. The offspring of tiger moms rarely play sports, exchange ideas with their peers , take part in social projects, clean their rooms or wash clothes. Since everything such children do is under the guidance of their protective mothers, they don't learn how to manage their time or plan a project. As such, their education is far from complete. They are unable to defend an idea--let alone come up with one--deal with opposing views, accept defeat or organize their life. Tiger moms want their children to be more competitive so that they can enter the best schools. But school is only one period in a person's life. What about real life? What kind of independence will these children have once they grow up? Today, children don't get the chance to discuss or choose what they want: learn to play the violin or piano; take up drawing or swimming. Their tiger moms decide for them. Ideally, parents should discuss with their children, give them a choice and explain to them that they will have to finish what they start. This would help children develop not only their judgment but also their sense of responsibility. The solution to this problem is total reform of the education sector. And the government knows that. But reform needs time. We can only hope the reform is completed before today's children become the ""sacrificed generation"". But we need to reform the existent mindset more than the education sector . Education is not only about memorizing books and taking exams. Therefore, we should stop seeing kindergartens as ""schools"", and ensure all schools have the same standards, and bookish knowledge is enriched by knowledge from other sources, from society and life itself. Mothers are not to be blamed for the present situation, for in their desire to provide the best education for their children they become victims of social trends. But let's hope the Chinese view of education will change, gradually if not rapidly, to the benefit of children, families and society as a whole. This is my wish on Mother's Day."

Newport thought many people tried to break Guinness records because _ .	"Passage 4 From the world's heaviest apple, the oldest lady to the world's smallest dog, these are all parts of a group of the world's strangest people and things. And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ). The book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world. People now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? ""It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world."" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport. The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it! The newest book came out last Tuesday. This book has a lot of interesting records. Here are two: A British dog, Whitney, is the world's smallest dog. It's only 76mm tall. An American woman Lee Redmond has the longest fingernails .They grew as long as 600 mm! She made the record in 1971."	['they could be known as the greatest by the world.']
"Su Dai used the example of""carrying faggots to put out a fire""to show _ ."	"In the last years of the Warring States period, the State of Qin attacked the State of Wei on a large scale repeatedly and occupied large areas of land, for the State of Wei was too weak to defend itself. In 273 B.C., the Qin army launched a more serious attack upon the State of Wei than ever. The king of the State of Wei gathered his officials, and asked with a worried look if anyone could propose a way to defeat the Qin army. After years of chaos caused by the wars, the officials trembled when fighting was mentioned, and no one dared to speak of resistance. At the critical moment when a large enemy force was bearing down upon the border, most of the officials persuaded the king to peace, at the cost of giving away to the State of Qin the large area of land north of the Huanghe River and south of the Taihang Mountain. However Su Dai, a counselor, did not agree. He hurried up to the king and said, ""Your Majesty, they don't think about the interests of the country at all. It is just because they are afraid of death that they ask you to sue for peace by betraying the country. Of course you can temporarily satisfy the ambition of Qin, but it will never stop attacking us until our land is totally given away."" He added,""Once there was a man whose house was on fire. People told him to put out the fire with water, but he would not listen. Instead, he carried a faggot to put out the fire, only to make the fire fiercer. Isn't it similar to carrying faggots to put out a fire if you agree to sue for peace at the cost of the land of the State of Wei?"" Though Su Dai's argument was very convincing, the king accepted the suggestion of those officials and gave away to the State of Qin a large area of the land of the State of Wei. As might be expected, the Qin army attacked the State of Wei in 225 B.C. again, surrounding the capital city Daliang and flooding it by digging open the dykes of the Huanghe River. The State of Wei was finally destroyed."	['the serious results of giving in']
"The sentence ""I said a prayer today and you were the answer"" most probably means that _ ."	"I was on the escalator in a market. There was an old man who was about five or six people in the front of me. People behind him were all in a hurry and saw him as a rock. The old man knew these clearly and tried hard to step aside. I remember...Sometimes when walking or driving behind an older person, I've gotten impatient and upset. ""I'm sorry. Please forgive me!"" said the old man, ""I don't mean to hold you up."" He then tried his best to get off the escalator. I suddenly saw this in a whole new light. I felt sick to my stomach. The old man was apologizing to everyone, when we should have helped him to calm his fears. One by one, people went around him quickly. By the time I got to him, I asked, ""Sir, can I help you?"" The man thought for a while, then said, ""Well, yes, thank you!"" I placed my hand under his left arm and walked away from the rush of people quickly. ""So what are you shopping for, sir?"" ""Oh, today is Mother's Day. I want to buy something for my neighbor. She's a single mother and she is always so nice to me."" he said, stopping suddenly as he searched his pocket. ""Oh, it's here! I always carry them with me,"" he said. Then he took out some business cards and handed me one which read: ""John Smith. Friend to all...enemy to no one! I said a prayer today and you were the answer. Thank you!"" ""That's for you,"" he said. ""Thanks for stopping to help an old man."" ""My friend, you helped me. I discovered why I was unhappy with the world. Now I know how to solve the problem. No more with me!"""	['the old man believed everyone could be friends']
According to the passage, people wouldn't like to give because _ .	"There's a body of water in Israel that is actually below sea level. Water constantly runs into it, but, because of the law of gravity ,nothing can flow out of it. Do you know the name of this famous lake? It's called the Dead Sea. It's called this because no living thing could live there. The water is almost dead, compared to what happens with ""living water"". When you think of the term ""living water"", the image that comes to mind is a rushing river that is flowing. It's filled with life and movement. It doesn't just ""receive"", but is also ""giving"" simultaneously. Many of us believe that we need to receive more of something in order to be happy. Whether what we desire is money or something else, we think we need more of it in order to be fulfilled. As a result, we begin to operate in fear and therefore don't give anything because we're afraid that we won't have enough. The result? Like the Dead Sea, we become lifeless. Life is meant to flow. when a pool stops flowing, it becomes stagnant . Stagnant water breeds disease and death. It can't breathe. It can't receive any more. If nothing is flowing out, there's no room for anything else to come in. The solution? Give. As you give, you'll receive. It's a universal law. You see it at work everywhere. we've somehow been deceived ( )into believing that if we don't give, we'll have more. Or we're afraid that if we do give, we won't have anything left. On one hand, this seems to make sense. But it doesn't work. Because when we don't give, we shut off the flow of what's coming in."	['they are still not satisfied']
What is this passage mainly about?	"Bit by bit, the sand dust that fills the sky is dying down. The blue sky and the burning sun once again hang over the desert. He is on the road, driving his beat-up yellow cab. The sides of the road are littered with damaged vehicles. Masses of smoke in the distance tell him that a war is being dragged on throughout his country. It's a fine day despite the choking heat. Not a breath of wind is blowing. A group of vehicles are traveling towards him, carrying many passengers. The scene reminds him of the market days in this country when crowds of trucks transport folks to the markets; the only difference is, this time, they are not trucks, but tanks, carrying foreigners, guns in hand. He stares at them. They stare back. So they pass by one another. ""The damned war!"" he whispers bitterly. Two days ago, a bomb fell on the market in front of his house, destroying nearly everything in sight. He survived by luck. He decided then and there that he would give up this cab business. This will be his final run. After this, he will leave this place together with his wife and children. ""Shala and my children, we'll soon meet each other again, after I'm done here."" He turns his head to take a glance at a photo of his wife and children. The glass on the frame is broken, but their smiles in the picture do not fail to provide him with the only comfort that he has. Shortly he arrives at a checkpoint. Tanks sit by the side of the road, the sight of which sends a marked coldness through his backbone. A bunch of soldiers armed to the teeth stand by. A foreign soldier signals him to stop. He calms himself down and pulls over. During the past few days, nearly no civilian vehicles come out of the capital city, his car being the only one on roads. A few foreign soldiers come up to him, one, two, three, four, five. The leader bends over to have a look at the old car, then at him. ""Where do you come from and where are you going?"" With a smile on his face, he answers with a broken speech in the tongue that the soldier can understand, ""Sir, I come from the capital. I'm leaving that place because it is a very dangerous place to be, with the war and everything."" While talking, he hands a cigarette over to the soldier, then lights it up for him. ""When will the war end?"" he asks. ""It won't take long. We'll soon give all of you in the capital the true freedom."" The soldier breathes a deep mouthful. He seems to have spotted the photo in the car, ""The cigarette is not bad at all. Are those your wife and kids? I have two of my own, roughly the same age."" ""Oh, yes, they are mine and they are constantly on my mind. They left the city a bit earlier, and I'm on my way to be reunited with them. Perhaps I'm never coming back. Driving a cab around during war times is too dangerous. I'm giving up the business."" He looks at the soldier, still smiling. ""After we overthrow your dictator , you won't have that to worry about. You can come back and pick up your life again."" The soldier is leaning on the door of the car. It is perhaps the first time in many days that he has seen a happy face among the local people. It cheers him up. ""Maybe, but I have to go to see my family. If you would pay us a visit, my wife will prepare a good meal for all of you. _ "" ""Can't make it. We're on duty. Give our regards to your wife and kids."" The soldier is a bit excited, thinking maybe quite some locals have open arms for them after all. ""Oh, yes, I almost forgot. The south is battle-infected. Where is your family?"" Still smiling, he picks up the broken picture frame, presses a kiss on the photo, then turns around, staring into the eyes of that soldier, not quite himself from excitement, and the other foreign soldiers holding guns. Words drop out of his lips slowly but firmly: ""Paradise."" Perhaps the last thing he sees is the confused, fearful, twisted expression on the face of that soldier, and the cigarette end dropping from his fingers. Then he pushes the button."

From the passage we know the moon was made of _ .	We have always been interested in the moon. 2000 years ago people already knew it moved around the earth and where it would be in the sky at different times of the year. At that time, everything about the moon was learned by watching it carefully in the sky. When scientists could use telescopes to study the moon more closely, their ideas began to change. They could see the moon was made of rocks. Most scientists thought moon rocks would be different from those on Earth. This was because they believed the moon had once been a planet that had been caught in the earth's gravity millions of years earlier. In 1969 moon rocks were finally brought to the earth and studied. Much to their surprise, scientists found that, except for water, the moon and the earth were made of the same things. Once again new ideas were needed for this new information. After years of study, most scientists now think that the moon was once part of Earth. They believe very early in its history, maybe 4 million years ago, something about the size of Mars hit Earth. This sent billions of rocks into space around our planet. These rocks slowly joined together and after many years became the moon. In the future, even though our ideas about the moon may change again, we will still be interested in it.	['rocks']
What could be the best title for the passage?	Not many people can say that they have lived in two totally different environments, and technically neither can I. I have lived in the same house in the same Connecticut town my whole life, but a lot of my childhood and teenage years have been spent visiting my family in New York City. Wethersfield is a typical New England town, a small close community where almost everyone knows your name. My friends all go to the same high school and my parents are friendly with my friends' parents. Most of my friends don't realize what life is like outside this little town. Maybe every so often a few take a day trip to Manhattan or Boston, but none really knows what it's like to live in an urban environment. My parents are both from New York City and since they have _ and friends who still live there, we visit a lot. From an early age I have been exposed to urban life. Jeff, one of my cousins, lives with his mother in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. He has never had his own room and has always been very much on his own. I don't think any of my friends could understand how someone could live like that. www.zxxk.com When I go to the city I see things I would never see in my hometown. I see poverty and people struggling to make a living. I observe a whole different pace; there, you're just one guy living with millions of others who will never know your name. I feel blessed to have experienced the lifestyles of two completely different places. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had. I feel that living in Wethersfield has given me a solid base in forming my character and the ability to deal in a close-knit society. On the other hand, my time spent in New York has exposed me to diverse cultural experiences. I feel that I would be comfortable in any environment and could make the best of any situation.

What message did the researcher intend to convey to parents?	"Reducing the amount of sleep students get at night has a direct impact on their performance at school during the day. According to classroom teachers, elementary and middle school students who stay up late exhibit more learning and attention problems. This has been shown by Brown Medical School and prefix = st1 /BradleyHospitalresearch. In the study, teachers were not told the amount of sleep students received when completing weekly performance reports, yet they rated the students who had received eight hours or less as having the most trouble recalling all the material, learning new lessons and completing high - quality work. Teachers also reported that these students had more difficulty paying attention. The experiment is the first to ask teachers to report on the effects of sleep deficiency in children. Just staying up late can cause increased academic difficulty and attention problems for otherwise healthy, well - functioning kids, said Garharn Forlone, the study's lead author. So the results provide professionals and parents with a clear message: when a child is having learning and attention problems, the issue of sleep has to be taken into consideration. ""If we don't ask about sleep, and try to improve sleep patterns in kids' struggling academically, then we aren't doing our job"", Forlone said. For parents, he said, the message is simple, ""getting kids to bed on time is as important as getting them to school on time."""	['They should see to it that their children have adequate sleep.']
"Who is probably a player of ""Hot Oink Grannies""?"	"Playing basketball isn't ladylike. That's what Jewell Chapman's high school headmaster told her in 1961 when he was against the girls' basketball program. ""We were very discouraged, "" said Chapman, a forward for her high school team of Des Moines. Nearly 50 years later, Chapman is back on the playground. She's 62 and plays for ""Hot Pink Grannies"", joining about 10 other women on a team whose uniforms are black trousers and hot pink socks. They play in the Iowa Granny Basketball League. It's one of dozens of basketball leagues for women over 50 that have arisen across the country. For some, it's a chance to exercise and meet people; for others, _ ""You see more and more elderly women's teams taking part in state and national competitions,"" said Michael Rogers, a professor in sports studies at Wichita State University. ""In the future it will be something common to have leagues like this."" Yearly surveys by the National Sporting Goods Association show the number of women aged 55 and older who play basketball at least 50 times a year has grown from 16,000 in 1995 to nearly 131,000 ten years later. The women on the Hot Pink Grannies are good - natured but competitive when game time comes. ""I think I'm tough"" says Colleen Pulliam, 69, showing off her strong arms at her challengers in a game against ""Strutters"", known for their bright yellow socks. Granny Basketball Leagues and similar groups spread quickly through much of the country, including California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C."	['Colleen Pulliam.']
It seems that smaller ants perform more of the _ .	Through a series of experiments an American scientist has gained an understanding of the social structure of the most complex of ant societies. The ants examined are the only creatures other than man to have given up hunting and collecting for a completely agricultural way of life. In their underground nests they cultivate gardens on soil made from finely chopped leaves. This is a complex operation requiring considerable division of labour. The workers of this type of ants can be divided into four groups according to the size. Each of the groups performs a particular set of jobs. The making and care of the gardens and the nursing of the young ants are done by the smallest workers. Slightly larger workers are responsible for chopping up leaves to make them suitable for use in the gardens and for cleaning the nest. A third group of still larger ants do the construction work and collect fresh leaves from outside the nest. The largest are the soldier ants, responsible for defending the nest. To find out how good the various size-groups are at different tasks, the scientist measured the amount of work done by the ants against the amount of energy they used. He examined first the gathering and carrying of leaves. He selected one of the size-groups, and then measured how efficiently these ants could find leaves and run back to the nest. Then he repeated the experiment for each of the other size-groups. In this way he could see whether any group could do the job more efficiently than the group normally undertaking it. The intermediate-sized ants that normally perform this task proved to be the most efficient for their energy costs, but when the scientist examined the whole set of jobs performed by each group of ants it appeared that some sizes of worker ant were not ideally suited to the particular jobs they performed.

"Why did he reply to the boss with ""It's raining cats and dogs""?"	"I worked abroad one year ago Once I was sent to attend a conference. It was downpouring outside, Though I was holding an umbrella, my trouser legs as well as my shoes and socks still got wet. Entering the conference hall, I shook the umbrella, and at the same time, stamped my feet. Suddenly I caught sight of my chief boss strolling in. At that time,I just got the job.Therefor,I hurriedly went to meet this superior in the highest rank and introduced myself to him as I was a new comer.He said,""Yes,I recognize you.Got your feet wet?""I lowered my head to look at my wet trouser legs and with a helpless tone,I said,""Yeah,It's raining cats and dogs,isn't it?""Gazing at me for a moment,the chief boss said nothing with a amile. Later on, I mentioned the incident of meeting the chief boss to my colleague. Hence I learnt that I had made a big fool of myself. It turns out that ""Get one's feet wet"" is an American slang , with the meaning of reaching the state of affairs."" However, I regarded myself as humorous and replied with a slang sentence, which is seldom used now, describing the rain falling heavily. This was completely off the point. I am lucky that the chief boss is really gentle and did not point it out at once."	"[""Because he misunderstood the meaning of the boss' slang.""]"
In order to persuade people to stop shopping, the campaigners _ .	"In the UK, a group of campaigners have declared the last Saturday in November as National Buy Nothing Day. ""Our message is clear: shop less, live more!"" says organizer Michael Smith. ""The challenge is to try simple living for a day. Spend time with family and friends, rather than spending money on them. Anyone can take part, provided they spend a day without spending."" On Buy Nothing Day, they take to the streets to tackle consumers . They dress as pigs to symbolize greed . They offer to cut up credit cards and hand out shopping bags with the words ""another useless thing I don't need"" written on the side. Some hold street parties to show shoppers that it is possible to have fun without spending money. Others go into shops and put notes saying ""don't buy me"" inside clothes and shoes. Some protestors are working against powerful forces. Many retailers and manufacturers depend on Christmas sales for most of their profits. Around two thirds of GDP in the West is made up of consumer spending. If this drops, many people will lose their jobs. At least that will make it easier for them to buy nothing. And there is also the risk that the campaigners will be seen as killjoys, who want to stop people enjoying themselves. ""There's a fun side to this,"" says Michael Smith. ""To some it's a protest, but it's also a street party. We're not saying that people are bad because they go shopping, but we need get the message across for people to consume wisely. And after we're finished, we'll probably go for a drink."""	['have different ways to make it']
A person with Down Syndrome _ according to the passage.	"When people ask me what Down Syndrome is, I tell them it's an extra chromosome . A doctor would tell you the extra chromosome causes an intellectual disability that makes it harder for me to learn things. Even though I have Down Syndrome, my life is a lot like yours. I read books and watch TV. I listen to music with my friends. I'm on the swim team and in chorus at school. I think about the future, and I like the one who I'll marry. And I get along with my sisters---except when they take CDs without asking! I'm a hard worker, a good person, and I care about my friends. Some of my classes are with typical kids, and some are with kids with learning disabilities. I have an aid who goes with me to my harder classes, like math and biology. She helps me take notes and gives me tips on how I should study for tests. It really helps, but I also challenge myself to do well. For instance, my goal was to be in a typical English class by 12thgrade. That's exactly what happened this year! It's true that I don't learn some things as fast as other people do. But that won't stop me from trying. I just know that if I work really hard and by myself I can do almost anything. I can't change the fact that I have Down Syndrome, but one thing I would change is what people think of me. I'd tell them, ""Judge me as a whole person, not just the person you see. Treat me with respect, and accept me for who I am. The most important---just be my friend."""	['has one more chromosome than normal people']

If you want to place an advertisement for a designer, you should publish it in _ .	"It is unlawful for an employer to publish a discriminatory advertisement. How to identify a discriminatory advertisement: * It must be read as a whole, and account must be taken not only of the words, but also of the pictures that it uses. * Job titles that have sexual connotations mean an intention to discriminate on the grounds of sex. Example 1 A notice in a restaurant window states: ""Waiters required"". The word ""waiters"" has a male, not a female, connotation. The advertisement does not contain an equal opportunities statement and does not specify that the jobs are open to men and women. Example2 A medical clinic places an advertisement for a nurse with a photograph of a female nurse. Nursing is an occupation that is traditionally associated with women. The advertisement does not contain an equal opportunities statement. Good practice checklist: * Advertise widely so that as many suitably qualified people as possible have an opportunity to apply. * Do not publish job advertisements in locations or publications where they are likely to be read wholly or mainly by people who share a particular community background, sex, race, disability, or age. * Use language which is clear and simple and do not use abstract words. For example, when describing the working environment or the characteristics of desirable employees, do not use words like young, mature or energetic. * Where possible, do not use job titles which have a male or female connotation. For example, do not use the following words--- waiter/waitress salesman/ salesgirl postman manageress foreman storeman matron chairman/ chairwoman head master/ mistress Instead, where possible, use job titles that have gender-neutral connotation, For example, the following words are appropriate--- waiting staff sales assistant postal worker manager stores person supervisor chairperson nurse manager head teacher"	['Southern Weekend']

Why did Kathy stopped to have a look at her compass? Because _ .	"""Get out of the plane!"" Justin shouted. Teddy and he dropped to the ground,.... When Kathy and Victor reached the edge of the grassland, flames were shooting more than five meters into the air. Kathy couldn't believe what she was seeing. One glance told her they needed medical attention immediately. She questioned Justin, "" Is there anyone in the plane?"" ""No,"" he said. ""Where are you able to radio for help?"" ""There was no time."" "" I'm a distance runner."" Kathy said, ""I'll go for help."" Looking at the seriously injured men, she said, ""It may take me several hours to get out."" She started out. When she was 23, Kathy set a women's-course record in a Marathon. She had run 42 kilometers. But now she was running the race of her life. She had nearly 30 kilometers of hard wilderness to cover to get help. Kathy had been running for two hours. This was far back into the wilderness. The trail grew unclear. She stopped to take a quick compass reading. She had run for more than 20 kilometers. Her heart fell, her muscle aching. Finally she saw her car in the distance. She jumped into the car and sped away. She reached a holiday house and called the police. During the wait she walked around, relaxing her legs and drinking water. It took almost two hours for a helicopter to reach her. They needed her for one more task."	['The trail grew vague']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	In 2002, the Beijing Municipal government led the nation in issuing an order banning electric bicycles from January 1, 2006. Since then a number of local governments have followed this. In May, the Legislature of Zhuhai in South China's prefix = st1 /GuangdongProvincebecame the first law-making body in the country to pass a regulation to keep electric bicycles off the roads. They claim environmental disadvantage and concerns over public safety justify their ban. Local government officials and law makers have argued their leading concern is the threat of pollution from spent lead-acid batteries. The ly high speed of electric bicycles --- faster than most common bikes at about 20 kilometers per hour --- is just too dangerous in the eyes of some policy-makers. They also mention interference with automobiles, common bikes and passers-by that results in accidents or slowed traffic. But none of these arguments justify the ban. In the first place, it should be made clear that while operating, the battery driving an electric bike sends out almost no polluting gas. They are much cleaner than cars. If the batteries, which can be used for one or two years, are thrown away without proper treatment or recycling, environmental damage is highly likely. It is required that electric bike producers and store sellers sign recycling contracts to ensure consumers can sell used batteries back to producers. In practice, some small producers neglect their recycling responsibility, causing concern for environmental pollution. It is clear the authorities can solve the problem through strengthening management. Although it will require some extra efforts from the government, it does not go beyond government officials' call of duty. Regarding the speed, there are technical standards governing the production of electric bikes. According to the standards, the designed speed should be limited to a maximum of 20 kilometers per hour. This is slower than the top speed of some mountain bikes. To _ the consumer desire for higher speed, some manufacturers have made it easy to remove speed-limiting devices after purchase, which is potentially very dangerous. To make the bicycles safer, local governments should draft regulations specifying severe punishments for rule-breakers. The black sheep should be picked up and punished, but violations by a small number of manufacturers or riders should not be an excuse to spoil the fun for everyone.

Having proved his skill to himself, Sanders _ .	"As a boy, Sanders was much influenced by books about the sea, but by the age of fifteen he had decided to become a doctor rather than a sailor. His father was a doctor. So he was often with the doctors and got along very well with them. When he was fourteen, he was already hanging around the hospital where he was supposed to be helping to clean the medicine bottles, but was actually trying to listen to the doctors' conversations with patients in the next room. During the war Sanders served in the army as a surgeon . ""That was the happiest time of my life. I was dealing with real sufferers and on the whole making a success of my job."" In Rhodes he taught the country people simple facts about medicine. He saw himself as a life-saver. He had proved his skill to himself and had a firm belief that he could serve those who lived simply, and were dependent upon him. Thus, while in a position to tell them what to do he could feel he was serving them. After the war, he married and set up a practice deep in the English countryside, working under an old doctor who hated the sight of blood. This gave the younger man plenty of opportunity to go on working as a life-saver."	['came to realize that he was really working for his countrymen']
What is the author's attitude towards cosmetic surgery?	Cosmetic ( ) surgery is usually performed to correct a physical abnormality or to enhance an otherwise normal physical feature and thus improve appearance. Cosmetic surgery is an extremely broad field that may offer reconstructive surgery for a patient after a damaging burn or other physical injuries yet can also be used to smooth out wrinkles or reshape a nose. Cosmetic surgery was first used regularly after World War I, when treatment and reconstruction of war injuries gave hope to young soldiers. As recently as fifty years ago, as the rich and famous began opting for elective cosmetic surgery, the subject was whispered about and considered taboo. Celebrities would disappear for months and then appear after secret cosmetic surgery looking younger, prettier, and thinner. Over time, cosmetic surgery has become accepted and even encouraged in some circles. Today there are even television reality shows about it. Some of the more popular forms of cosmetic surgery are liposuction( ), in which excessive fat is sucked out of the body with a tube and vacuum device; laser facial resurfacing, which smooths lines on the face around the eyes and mouth and eliminates facial blemishes ; and hair replacement surgery, which fills in balding areas using a patient's own hair. There are many more forms of cosmetic surgery, including variations of these.Anyone interested in cosmetic surgery should consider the risks and remember that it is, ultimately, surgery. Not all procedures come out exactly the way doctors and patients foresee, and recovery is just like any other surgery, complete with pain and the possibility of infection . While cosmetic surgery is an option, patients should choose doctors wisely,obtain several references, and keep realistic expectations.	['Cautious.']

Why didn't they have anything that evening?	"It's Really a Miracle Mr. Brown works in New York and he brought his family to China last summer. They visited many places of interest and had a good time here. Before they left for New York, the Browns climbed the Great Wall. It was the greatest project over two thousand years ago. They took a lot of photos there and then they had a picnic under a big tree. Suddenly it began to rain and they hurried to the car. And when they returned to the hotel, they couldn't find the bag in which their expensive camera was. They were all sorry for it. They could buy another camera but had no time to go to the Great Wall again. They could not miss the plane! That evening they didn't have supper. Mr. Brown hoped to make them happy, so he said, ""Well, let me tell you a story. An old man lived in a sixty-floor building. One day he fell down from it when he was cleaning the window. But he didn't hurt himself."" ""It was a miracle!"" called out his children, ""Why?"" ""Because he lived on the first floor!"" They all began to laugh while two policemen with a bag came in. They said a Chinese boy found it under a big tree and he asked them to find out who lost it. ""It's really a miracle!"" the Browns said happily."	['Because they were sorry for losing the camera.']
Which of the following can best describe Wang Weiguo?	Wang Weiguo, an award-winning actor of the National Theatre Company of China, was wandering through Bejing's Panjiayuan Flea Market when he found a treasure, 20 exquisite picture frames . He bought them all. Inside the frames was a woman's life story. There were pictures of her as a baby and a growing child and pictures with her parents. Wang Weiguo was sure someone had lost them. He contacted the police and media. He showed them to friends and to people living outside China. No one recognized the people in the photographs. That was 1999. Wang never gave up the search. In 2010 he told the story to a TV host, Zhang Zequn, who suggested he contact China Radio International. Within three months of the story's being posted on CRI, someone recognized Julie Ege in one of the photographs. The wonderful Norwegian actress and model was the mother of the child whose growing years the photos traced. The child was Joanna Syson. She moved to Beijing in the 1990s to study Chinese. In 1999 she returned to Norway for six months, entrusting all her belongings, including the photographs, to a friend. When she returned, the friend was gone. So were her belongings. She was heartbroken. More than a decade passed. Then, thanks to the story posted on CRI and to a visitor to the website, the trail finally led to Joanna Syson. She traveled to Bejing to meet Wang Weiguo, who had searched for her for 12 years, and to recover her treasured photographs.	['Kind and determined.']

The writer began this passage by asking you a question because _ .	"""How many common English words were invented by Shakespeare?"" How long did it take people to find the answer to this question 15 years ago? And now! you can google it and find the answer immediately! Google is the most popular Internet search engine in the world. It was invented by two students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They met in 1993, when they were studying computer science at Stanford University, USA. They dreamed of producing something that could also answer any question in seconds. Internet search engines at that time were slow and gave many websites that weren't useful. In January 1996, Page and Brin decided to make a better and faster search engine. They thought the results should be based on the most popular websites. Nobody would give them money for their project, so they used their own money. They also borrowed money from family and friends. Then, in 1998, they were given a _ for $100,000, and they started their own company. Their first office was in a friend's garage. The company's name is Google, a word which comes from mathematics. A ""google"" is a very high number---- 1 followed by a hundred zeros. The google search engine was soon used by thousands of people worldwide because it was fast, easy and correct. By 2002 it was the biggest search engine on the Internet. Now, more questions have been answered by Google than any other Internet service, from sport to science, and from music to medicine. Google hopes that in the future all the world's information will be put on the Internet, so that everybody can find everything."	['he or she wanted to make the readers interested in this passage']
Amelia's flight was important because _ .	The year was 1932. Amelia Earhart was flying alone from North America to England in a small single--engine airplane. At midnight, several hours after she had left Newfoundland, she ran into bad weather. To make things worse, her altimeter failed.(The altimeter shows the height of the plane above the ground.) At night and in a storm, a pilot is in great difficulty without an altimeter. At times, her plane nearly plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. Just before daylight, there was further trouble. Amelia noticed flames coming from the engine. Would she be able to reach land? There was nothing to do except to keep going and to hope. Amelia Earhart did reach Ireland, and for the courage she had shown, she was warmly welcomed in England and the rest of Europe. When she returned to the United States, she was honored by President Hoover at a special dinner in the White House. From that time on, Amelia Earhart became famous. What was so important about her flight? Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly the Atlantic Ocean alone, and she set a record of fourteen hours and fifty-six minutes.

The passage wrote about Hemingway in order to show that	Robert Frost was one of America's best known and most honored serious writers. But his fame came late in his life. He was born in San Francisco, California in 1874. He lived in California during his early childhood. He was named after the chief Southern general in America's Civil War. The general's name was Robert Edward Lee. The poet was named Robert Lee Frost, because his father wanted to honor the general. Someone once asked another American writer, Ernest Hemingway, how to become a writer. The best thing, he said, was to have an unhappy childhood. If this is true, Robert Frost's childhood was unhappy enough to make him a very good writer. Robert Frost's father was a reporter who wanted to be a politician. He often drank too much wine and became angry. Robert was the victim of his anger. Robert Frost finished high school in 1891. After high school, Robert's grandfather offered to pay his costs at Dartmouth College. But Robert left the school after a few months. He did not like it. He spent the next few years working at different jobs. At one time, he worked in a factory. Later, he repaired shoes. He was a teacher. He was a reporter. Always, he wrote poetry. Robert Frost attended Harvard University for two years. After that, he returned to the many jobs he held before. For a while, Frost tried to take care of a farm in the state of New Hampshire. He was not a successful farmer. And he continued to write poetry. He said that until 1930, he earned only about ten dollars a year from writing. In 1912, he decided to try to make a new start. He took his family to Britain. The cost of living was low. In Britain, Frost found a publisher for his first book of poems. The book was called A Boy's Will. When it appeared in 1913. Frost received high praise from British readers. Praise was something he had not received in his own country. Ezra Pound, another American poet living in Britain, read the poems and liked them very much. He wrote a magazine article about Frost. He also helped get Frost's second book of poems published in America. That book was called North of Boston.	['Frost spent his childhood unhappily']
It is easier to fall into _ than into _ .	It is easier to go down the hill than to climb up the hill,so it is easier to fall into bad habits than into good ones.Bad habits do not come suddenly. They come little by little without one being aware of their danger. School boys first pick up little bad habits in the school and on the street. When they can't write their lessons,they copy from their schoolmates. If they see bigger boys smoking,they also want to learn to smoke. If they see their friends gambling ,they want to gamble. When they get bigger,the habits become stronger and stronger,so that they can no longer get rid of(,)them. From copying,they learn to steal,from gambling,they learn to cheat. At last they become distrusted by everybody. How necessary it is that we get rid of the bad habits in the beginning.	['bad habits;good ones']

43. The differences between British and American English are not important because _	"Englishmen speak British English and Americans speak American English. A student is learning to speak British English. He often asks himself, ""Can Americans understand me when I speak British English?"" Learners often ask ""What's the difference between British English and American English?""Certainly there are some differences between British and American English. The Englishmen say ""Have you a pen?"" While Americans say ""Do you have a pen?"" The pronunciation is sometimes different. Americans often sound ""r"" in words like ""bird"" and ""hurt"". The British speakers don't sound the ""r"" in these words. There are differences in spelling. For example, ""colour"" and ""neighbour"" are British while ""color"" and ""neighbor"" are American. These differences in grammar, pronunciation and spelling are not important, however. For the most part, British and American English are the same language. When Englishmen and Americans are talking with each other, they don't need an interpreter . Maybe some day they need, but not now."	['British English and American English are the same language']
What's the best title for this passage?	"The illegal ivory trade has been a major problem in Africa for decades. Poachers and hunters have killed off hundreds of thousands of elephants to obtain this precious material. Now, affected areas are taking action. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced on Wednesday that key states where poaching takes place have promised to stop the ivory trade and protect Africa's elephants. In the 1980s, as many as 1 million elephants across Africa were killed for their ivory tusks. This continued until 1989, when the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade , demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations slowly began to increase. However, this progress was short-lived. According to the IUCN, 2011 saw the highest levels of poaching and illegal ivory trading in at least 16 years. Around 25,000 elephants were killed in Africa that year. Preliminary data from the IUCN shows even higher levels of illegal trade may have been reached in 2013. ""With about 22,000 elephants illegally killed in 2012, we continue to face a critical situation,"" said John E. Scanlon, CITES Secretary-General. ""Current elephant poaching in Africa remains far too high, and could soon lead to local extinctions if the present killing rate continues."" At the African Elephant Summit, key African states where elephants make their home agreed to develop a ""zero-tolerance attitude"" towards poaching. The deal calls for maximum sentences for poachers and hunters, and increased cooperation between affected states. Officials are determined to classifying wildlife trading as a serious crime -- and to making sure that the people who commit it are punished. All participants at the conference agreed to sign the deal. With these states coming together, there may yet be hope for elephants. (293 words)"	['New Hope for Elephants.']

Place: Comedy Theatre The Children's Hour The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman is a striking play about the power of a lie. Karen Wright (Keira Knightley) and Martha Dobie (Elisabeth Moss) run a girls' boarding school in the 1930s New England.

What's the key point for the death of the aristocrats mentioned in the passage?	"Can you imagine that several hundred years ago, tomatoes were seen as _ food in Europe? What made Europeans believe this was John Gerard's publication of Herbal in 1597. Gerard wrote: ""The leaves and stalks of the tomato plant are toxic."" Undoubtedly, Gerard's opinion was based on a misunderstanding of tomatoes. But his opinion was widely spread in Britain and North America for over two hundred years. In the late 1700s, a lot of Europeans held more fears for tomatoes. A nick name for the fruit was ""poison apple"" because it was believed that aristocrats got sick and died after eating them. But the actual reason was the pewter plates they used. Since tomatoes are high in acidity, when placed on the plates, the lead in the plates would dissolve . This caused many deaths. Unluckily, no one knew this at that time. So the innocent tomatoes were picked as the killer. Today, more than one and a half billion tons of tomatoes are produced every year around the world. Tomatoes are cooked in various ways. This healthy and tasty food finally wins its innocence back."	['Chemical reaction.']
The purpose of the passage is to _ .	Most people agree that it's important to have a sense of humor. Having the ability to laugh can help one overcome anxiety, and make better decisions in difficult situations. People with a well-developed sense of humor appear to be happier, and some are healthier as well. This suggests that having a sense of humor is good for you. Humorless people may find themselves being treated as a fool, and become anxious and upset. A sense of humor also plays an important role in human relationships. However, not everyone has a sense of humor. People with developmental disabilities can sometimes have no sense of humor, or have a very strange one. A number of factors affect a person's sense of humor, with the age probably being the main one. Young children are often highly amused by simple jokes or shows, while teenagers prefer to enjoy the ironic events. Educational level, culture, and religious faith also affect one's sense of humor. While Christians, for example, may have a deep appreciation of jokes about the Bible, others may find them disrespectful. Many people believe that a sense of humor is something that develops on its own, and that you cannot teach someone to understand why jokes, certain comments, situations or events are funny. However, things can be done to _ one's sense of humor. Children, for example, benefit from being told jokes and encouraged to laugh, although some children's jokes might seem rather strange to adults. If you have children, try to encourage them to tell jokes and think about what makes things funny. And it will help them develop a sense of humor.

Which of the following is true about their first meeting with each other?	"Every Christmas the giant tree inprefix = st1 /RockefellerCentersparkles with thousands of lights. From the beginning, when construction workers raised the first one during the depths of the Depression, it has been a symbol of hope. Diana Abad, like most Americans, loved that tree. In 1999, however, Diana was writing her will. The 33-year-old woman from Staten Island, New York, was diagnosed with leukemia and wanted to put her things in order. Doctors told her she had nine months to live. Her slim chance for survival lay in finding a bone marrow donor. The most likely source for a match is always among s -- but her family was tested and there was none. Then one day in February 2000, she got a call from the hospital saying that out of the four million people _ in the National Marrow Donor Program Registry, there was only one match. The potential donor was thinking about it. In March the donor agreed, and the transplant procedure was scheduled for March 27. On that day, a doctor came in with the marrow in a bag, and Diana remembers him saying:""This is it. If it doesn't graft within four to six hours, nothing will bring you back."" Diana asked a priest to give her last rite . Almost immediately after the two-hour procedure, she felt stronger. Doctors told her it looked like the graft had taken. Donors are anonymous, but when she was better, Diana sent a note through the Registry: ""You don't know the joy that I am experiencing,"" she wrote. ""I hope that one day we can meet and I can thank you in person."" It was several months before the donor replied. At first he didn't even give his name. He was 34-year-old David Mason, and he lived inDedham,Massachusetts. But eventually the two exchanged phone numbers and began to talk. Then unexpectedly and unannounced, he turned up at her door inEnglishtown,New Jersey, on December 23. She says it was love at first sight. He says he didn't feel it until they met the second time. That meeting began a long-distance romance that culminated under the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center in December 2004. That's where David proposed to Diana. She, of course, said yes."

To such children as described in the passage _	"""It hurts me more than you,''and ""This is for your own good.''These are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin,clean my room,stay home and do homework. That was before we entered the permissive period in educafion in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school.The schools and the educators made it easy on us.They thought that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators,turned on the television,left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers,faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years,are realizing we've made a terrible mistake.One such teacher is Sharon Klompus who says of her students-""so passive""-and-wonders what happened.Nothing was demanded of them,she believes. Television,says Klompus,contributes to children's passivity.""We're not training kids to work any more,"" says Klompus.""we're talking about a generation of kids who've never been hurt or hungry.They have learned somebody will always do it for them. Instead of saying 'go look it up',you tell them the answer.It takes greater energy to say no to a kid."" Yes,it does.It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work.It's time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it's for their own good.It's time to start telling them no again."

For example, speakers of British English say ""in hospital"" and ""Have you a pen?"" Americans say ""in the hospital!"" and ""Do you have a pen?"". Pronunciation is sometimes different. Americans usually sound theirs in words like ""bird"" and ""hurt"". Speakers of British English do not sound theirs in these words. There are differences between British and American English in spelling and vocabulary. For example, ""colour"" and ""honour"" are British, ""color"" and honor"" are American. These differences in grammar, pronunciation, spelling and vocabulary are not important, however. For the most part, British and American English are the same language."	['little']
A typical blues Stanza is made up of _ .	"During the 1800s, African Americans worked long days in the fields of the American South.To ease their labor, they sang ""field hollers"" that they had brought from Africa.One person sang a line.Then a group of workers repeated it.The songs' words told of the hardships that people suffered.African Americans sang ""shout spirituals"", or joyous religious songs.They clapped their hands and stomped their feet to the music. After the Civil War, the music changed dramatically.African American music, from ballads to church music, took new forms.It also adapted dance music, called ""jump-ups"".which had great rhythm. Banjos became popular.A blues singer usually played a call and response with the banjo.By the early 1900s, the guitar had replaced the banjo as the main blues instrument. Northern Mississippi - called the Delta - was the center of the blues tradition.By the 1920s, the Delta had many clubs, so-called juke joints.African Americans listened and danced to music in these clubs.Some of the greatest blues men and women performed there. Blues have a soulful sound that is easy to recognize.The musical notes are often ""bent"".That is, they are changed slightly to give a song more strength.Whatever their origin, these bent notes most often define the blues. Lyrics are the words of a song.Blues lyrics describe everyday life.The lyrics, often about relationships between men and women, are often very intense and personal.They tell about sorrow and overwork.They tell about finding or losing love, having money or being broke, being happy or sad and lonely.The lyrics may use humor to describe life's trials and joys.They almost always use the rhythms of everyday speech.A typical blues stanza, or group of lyrics, has three lines.The second line repeats the first line.The third line has different words. By the 1940s, large numbers of African Americans had left the Delta and moved north to work. Many settled in Chicago.There, a new kind of ""electric"", or ""Chicago"" blues began.Many of its themes were the same, but these blues had ""wailing"" electric guitars and harmonicas.The music had a steady, strong drumbeat.The loud, driving Chicago blues was excellent dance music.Chicago blues led to the birth of a new music style-rock and roll."

What was the executive worried about?	"The business executive was deep in debt and could see no way out. Creditors were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy . Suddenly an old man appeared before him. ""I can see that something is troubling you."" he said. After listening to the executive, the old man said: ""I believe I can help you."" He asked the man his name, wrote out a check, and pushed it into his hand saying: ""Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time."" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come. The business executive saw in his hand a check for $500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world! ""I can settle all my debts in a moment!"" he realized. But instead, the executive decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again. Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the executive was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man. ""I'm so glad I caught him!"" she cried. ""I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller."" And she led the old man away by the arm."

Which of the following statements is Not true according to the passage?	Christmas in Australia is often very hot. Whereas the northern hemisphere is in the middle of winter, Australians are baking in summer heat. It is not unusual to have Christmas Day well into the mid 30 degrees Celsius, or near 100 degrees Fahrenheit. A traditional meal includes a turkey dinner, with ham, and pork. A flaming Christmas plum pudding is added for dessert. In the Australian gold rushes, Christmas puddings often contained a gold nugget. Today a small favor is baked inside. Whoever finds this knows s/he will enjoy good luck. Another treat is Mince Pies. Some Australians and particularly tourists often have their Christmas dinner at midday on a local beach, Bondi Beach in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs attracts thousands of people on Christmas Day. Other families enjoy their day by having a picnic. If they are at home, the day is punctuated by swimming in a pool, playing Cricket out the backyard, and other outdoor activities. The warm weather allows Australians to enjoy a tradition which started in 1937. Carols by Candlelight is held every year on Christmas Eve, where tens of thousands of people gather in the city of Melbourne to sing their favorite Christmas songs. The evening is lit by as many candles singing under a clean cut night sky. The sky with its Southern Cross stars is like a mirror. Sydney and the other capital cities also enjoy Carols in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Australians surround themselves with Christmas Bush, a native plant which has little red flowered leaves.

What is the main reason for a celebrity's opting for cosmetic surgery?	Cosmetic ( ) surgery is usually performed to correct a physical abnormality or to enhance an otherwise normal physical feature and thus improve appearance. Cosmetic surgery is an extremely broad field that may offer reconstructive surgery for a patient after a damaging burn or other physical injuries yet can also be used to smooth out wrinkles or reshape a nose. Cosmetic surgery was first used regularly after World War I, when treatment and reconstruction of war injuries gave hope to young soldiers. As recently as fifty years ago, as the rich and famous began opting for elective cosmetic surgery, the subject was whispered about and considered taboo. Celebrities would disappear for months and then appear after secret cosmetic surgery looking younger, prettier, and thinner. Over time, cosmetic surgery has become accepted and even encouraged in some circles. Today there are even television reality shows about it. Some of the more popular forms of cosmetic surgery are liposuction( ), in which excessive fat is sucked out of the body with a tube and vacuum device; laser facial resurfacing, which smooths lines on the face around the eyes and mouth and eliminates facial blemishes ; and hair replacement surgery, which fills in balding areas using a patient's own hair. There are many more forms of cosmetic surgery, including variations of these.Anyone interested in cosmetic surgery should consider the risks and remember that it is, ultimately, surgery. Not all procedures come out exactly the way doctors and patients foresee, and recovery is just like any other surgery, complete with pain and the possibility of infection . While cosmetic surgery is an option, patients should choose doctors wisely,obtain several references, and keep realistic expectations.	['The celebrity wants to be younger, prettier, and thinner.']
The author got into some bad habits because _ .	"My life began similarly to most children but I grew up without knowing what a father or mother was. No one was there to teach me how to tell right from wrong. Because of this, I got into some bad habits and spent seven years as a boy on the street. When I was 20, I was taken in a rehab clinic . Inside I met Bill, my counselor . He taught me a lot of things. The main thing was the gift of giving. It was the night before an important test and I was very nervous. Bill invited me to go out for a walk to relax me. As we walked and talked, Bill suggested we should go for a coffee. I told him I had no money when I got paid, and I offered to pay him back. He stopped then and looked at me in a serious, but loving way and said he was doing this because he wanted to. Then he said, ""One day when you'll be around someone who will need a coffee, you'll be able to buy it for them. That's how you can pay me back."" I'm a primary school teacher now. My job is simple and I can buy young people coffee now. Bill taught me how to offer help to others."	"[""he didn't have parents to teach him""]"
Why do many people believe angels can fly?	"A leading biologist has found the angels and fairies that sit at top of Christmas trees did not get there under their own power. Prof Roger Wotton, from University College London, found that flight would be impossible for angels with arms and bird-like feathered wings. ""Angels cannot take off and cannot use powered flight,"" said Prof Wotton. ""They would need to be exposed to very high wind velocities at take off - such high winds that they would be blown away."" Some the world's most famous religious paintings and architecture make most Americans believe in angels. The study found that 68 per cent of the 36,000 adults thought that angels and demons were at work in the world. According to the latest study, angels lack the powerful muscles which allow birds to beat their wings. Prof Wotton's paper explores why there are so many stories about angels. ""Angels are very powerful religious icons for people with faith. Their similarity to humans adds to their power. At the same time, they have wings on them because they are more than human. They take messages to heaven and therefore have to fly."" said the academic."	['Angels with wings can take messages to heaven and therefore have to fly.']
Which part of a newspaper is the passage possibly taken from?	"America has been experiencing the longest economic increase in its history. Incomes have risen, unemployment has fallen, and cities such as New York are bursting with new office buildings. But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless----one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminum cans and sells them for five cents a piece. At night, he sleeps on the street. ""I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,"" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine. But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement. He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York City rose more than 27 per cent, from $549 to $700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies are building for the poor. Many small apartments in the city now rent for $1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her. She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house. Smiling, he said he also has seven grandchildren whom he'd like to see more often. ""All I've got to do is _ ,"" he said."

Why do some parents pay the self-publishing bill?	"The television news feature about Ben Heckmann, an eighth grader from Farmington, Minn, was breathless in its praise. ""At 14, he has accomplished something many adults can't achieve,"" the reporter said, ""Ben is a twice-published author."" But Ben's two ""Velvet Black"" books, describing a fictional rock band, were not picked from a pile of manuscripts by an eagle eyed publisher. They were self-published, at the cost of $400 by Ben's parents. Over the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a ""published author."" The mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player. But others see self-publishing as a lost opportunity to teach children about hardship and perseverance. Mr. Robbins, a critic, thinks it is wonderful to start writing at a young age, but worries self-publishing sends the wrong message. ""There are no prodigies in literature,"" he said. ""Literature requires experience, in a way that mathematics and music do not."" Alan Rinzler, a publishing industry veteran, suggested parents hire a professional editor like him to work with their child to tear a manuscript apart and help make a better. Ben's father, Ken, said Ben's ambitions ""weren't to knockHarry Potteroff the list,"" but ""to get that good feeling inside that you've done something."" Ajla Dizdarevic, 12, who has self-published two books of poetry, has been on television and in local newspapers. ""Being a published author,"" she said, ""was always a dream of mine."" Her new dream: three books by age 15."	['They want to give encouragement to their children.']
In what column may readers probably read the passage?	"BC Social Report, August 14, 2010 Scandinavians may spend a lot of the winter in darkness but they are the happiest people in Europe, according to a study showed this month. Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of life. The survey entitled: ""No Man is an Island"" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10. Danes --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' ""Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,"" the study said. Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness. Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks. ""People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,"" she said."	['Health and Happiness.']

The writer wants to tell us _ .	Is it a tree? Is it a bear? If you're looking at a tree in the shape of a bear, it's a topiary . A topiary is a tree or bush that is trained into a shape. Growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills. A topiary gardener should make a drawing first. The drawing shows the final shape that the gardener likes. The gardener then chooses a bush for the topiary. It may be one that just planted or one that is already in place. In June of the plant's first year, the gardener looks for new leaves. When the leaves grow, it's time to shape the bottom of the bush. It needs about five years. The top is not _ during this time. In the fifth year, the bush grows tall enough for shaping. Then the gardener begins to shape the whole bush. Once a topiary has been started, it needs care all year. In the summer it must be cut many times to keep its shape. This cutting also helps the bush grow. In the winter the bushes don't grow. The gardeners have to brush snow off the plants, or snow may hurt some parts of them. Topiary gardening is a very old art. The Romans did it in the first century. In the sixteenth century, people in Europe liked topiaries too. By the late 1600s, topiaries were also grown in America. Today it's popular in many parts of the world.	['growing a topiary garden takes both time and skills']
Why are gravitational waves difficult to detect?	"It took 100 years, but finally, scientists proved Albert Einstein's theory that gravitational waves exist. The waves were predicted as part of Einstein's general theory of relativity nearly 100 years ago. It was the theory of the physics behind the workings of our world and the universe. The idea was that the waves are like ripples in space, caused by some of the violent and energetic processes in the universe. For example, two black holes crashing into each other. Now a group of scientists, including ones from Caltech, MIT and the LIGO Scientific, Collaboration finally found the gravitational waves. David Reitze is the executive director of the LIGO observatory at Caltech. ""We have detected gravitational waves. We did it!"" What are these gravitational waves? Well, imagine throwing a rock into a pond. When the rock hits the flat surface of the water, it creates ripples or waves. Space-time is like the surface of the water. So that means gravitational waves are like the ripples moving out from where the rock hits the water. It might be hard to understand, but those gravitational waves expand and contract space and time as they move through space. And when they get to the Earth, the waves pass through, and they contract and expand the planet as the waves go by. It was Einstein who said these gravitational waves should be observable. But these are not huge waves. They are very, very small, which is why it took so long to find them. You cannot see them with your eyes. They are smaller than the size of an atom. How did the scientists find them? They used a giant scientific tool called LIGO, which stands for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The billion-dollar LIGO project is two L-shaped observatories. One is in Louisiana and the other in Washington state. For years, scientists have been watching two black holes in another faraway galaxy. The two were spinning around each other, moving closer and closer together. When they finally crashed into each other, it was with such power and force that gravitational waves rang throughout the universe, like a giant bell. Those waves, traveling at the speed of light, finally reached the Earth, some l. 3 billion years later. They are the same waves that the scientists announced this past week. So, what does this discovery mean? Our understanding of the heavens changed dramatically."	['Because they are too small.']
When a jockey is riding a fast horse, he doesn't _ .	"Jockeys are the smallest athletes. They are rarely over five feet six, or 120 pounds. The lighter the weight on the horse, the faster it can go. Riding fast horses on the track is tough on the small jockeys. The jockey doesn't""sit""on the horse. He leans forward on his legs. The strain is on his thighs and calf muscles. As jockeys age, their legs""go""first. Jockeys also need arm strength. It's a strain holding a 1000-pound racehorse. On muddy days, jockeys get a pounding of mud. The mud comes flying off the hooves of the horses in front. ""It feels like someone is punching you all over,""says one rider. And a jockey can be hurt. A jockey can have a leg jammed between two horses. Or it can get caught between horse and the rail. The worst accidents are from falls. A horse may fall on his rider. Or horses behind may trample if he hits the track. In one year about 240 riders are hurt badly. That's one out of six jockeys. But the jockeys are well-paid. A jockey keeps about ten percent of the money his horses win. Jacinto Vasquez, a five-foot-three comer, has ridden horses to $7,000,000 in wins in the last eight years, which means he does almost $100,000 a year. Why do some jockeys do better than others? ""It isn't the way a boy sits on a horse or uses the reins or the whip,""says Conn McCreary. McCreary was a top jockey of the 1950's. He rode two Kentucky Derby winners. ""Most jockeys do this the same. It's the 'feel' he has for the horses."" ""When you come right down to it, it just seems that horses run better for some riders,"" McCreary says. ""A real good jockey doesn't lose with the best horse. And sometimes he'll win with the second or third best."" Many Latin-American riders, like Jacinto, seem to have the _ . ""Maybe it's because we grew up with horses,""says Jacinto. ""Maybe it's because we like to ride. There was a strike at Aqueduct last year. We, Jorge Velasquez, and Angel Cordero (two other top Latin riders) went to a park. We rented horses, and rode around the bridle path !"""	['really sit on the horse']
When new students come to school on the first day they usually feel _ .	You may not know a lot of people when you start high school. Even if you know some new students, you still feel nervous that you don't know any upperclassmen and teachers. How are you going to make friends among this sea of unknown faces? Most high schools welcome new students before school actually starts. These are helpful not only because you learn your way around the buildings and get to meet some of your teachers, but also because you get to meet new students. That way, when you show up on your first day of school, you may already recognize a few familiar faces. When you talk to people, you'll probably find that a lot of them are feeling just like you. They're all new to the school and don't know what to expect. Talking about a common concern with your classmates can help you develop friendships. The work in high school is something freshmen are probably worried about. The work in high school builds on what you learned in middle school, giving you a more advanced knowledge of many subjects. So you may find you have more work to do or that it's a bit more challenging . If you ever find your work too difficult, teachers can give you extra help. High school also has more activities after class than middle school, such as clubs, music and theater groups and sports teams. This is a good time to explore your interests and try new things. Middle school taught you the basics of academics, time management, and social skills while providing you with a little extra support and guidance. High school gives you the chance to learn how to be more independent and responsible .	['nervous']
What advice does the author give in the passage?	"""Did you hear what happened to Adam last Friday?"" Lindsey whispers to Tori. With her eyes shining, Tori brags, ""You bet I did. Sean told me two days ago."" What are Lindsey and Tori talking about? It just happens to be yours truly, Adam Freedman. I can tell you that what they are saying is (a) not nice and (b) not even true. Still, Lindsey and Tori aren't very different from most students here at Linton High School, including me. Many of our conversations are gossip . I have noticed three effects of gossip: it can hurt people, it can give gossipers a strange kind of satisfaction, and it can cause social pressures in a group. An important negative effect of gossip is that it can hurt the person being talked about. Usually, gossip spreads information about a topic--breakups, troubles at home, even dropping out--that a person would rather keep secret. The more embarrassing or shameful the secret is, the juicer the gossip it makes. Probably the worst type of gossip is the absolute lie. People often think of gossipers as harmless, bur cruel lies can cause pain. If we know that gossip can be harmful, then why do so many of us do it? The answer lies in another effect of gossip: the satisfaction it gives us. Sharing the latest rumor can make a person feel important because he or she knows something that others don't. Similarly, hearing the latest rumor can make a person feel like part of the ""in group"". In other words, gossip is satisfying because it gives people a sense of belonging or even superiority . Gossip can also have a third effect: it strengthens unwritten, unspoken rules about how people should act. Professor David Wilson explains that gossip is important in policing behaviors in a group. Translated into high school terms, this means that if everybody you hang around with is laughing at what John wore or what Jane said, then you can bet that wearing or saying something similar will get you the same kind of negative attention. The do's and don'ts conveyed through gossip will never show up in any student handbook. The effects of gossip vary depending on the situation. The next time you feel the urge to spread the latest news, think about why you want to gossip and what effects your ""juicy story"" might have."	['Think twice before you gossip.']

Many schools were destroyed and there were many students and teachers who left us forever. Sadness, hopelessness and different kinds of danger spread out here and there!

What did Rashid plan to do after his arrival in Sydney?	Arriving in Sydney on his own from India, my husband, Rashid, stayed in a hotel for a short time while looking for a house for me and our children. During the first week of his stay, he went out one day to do some shopping. He came back in the late afternoon to discover that his suitcase was gone. He was extremely worried as the suitcase had all his important papers, including his passport . He reported the case to the police and then sat there, lost and lonely in strange city, thinking of the terrible troubles of getting all the paperwork organized again from a distant country while trying to settle down in a new one. Late in the evening, the phone rang. It was a stranger. He was trying to pronounce my husband's name and was asking him a lot of questions. Then he said they had found a pile of papers in their trash can that had been left out on the footpath. My husband rushed to their home to find a kind family holding all his papers and documents. Their young daughter had gone to the trash can and found a pile of unfamiliar papers. Her parents had carefully sorted them out, although they had found mainly foreign addresses on most of the documents. At last they had seen a half-written letter in the pile in which my husband had given his new telephone number to a friend.

And we welcome the contributions of all people-no matter their origin or color or beliefs-who call America home, and who enrich the life of our nation. It is a belief as old as our founding:""Epluribus unum"" -- _ . We are reminded that this creed, and America itself was never an inevitability, but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals-by taking the blessings of freedom, and multiplying them for those who would follow. As President Kennedy once wrote, even as we give thanks for all that we've inherited from those who came before us-""the decency(,) of purpose, steadfastness of resolve and strength of will, for the courage and the humility, which they possessed."" we must also remember that ""the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them."" Today,we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals, including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families, who sacrifice so much to keep America safe.We are grateful to the countless Americans who serve their communities in soup kitchens and shelters,looking out for those who are less fortunate,and lifting up those who have fallen on hard times. This generosity, this compassion, this belief that we are each other's keepers, is essential to who we are, not just on this day,but every day.It's easy to focus on what separates us.But as we gather with loved ones on this Thanksgiving, let's remember and be grateful for what ties us together. Our love of country.Our commitment to justice and equality.Our belief that America's best days are ahead,and that her destiny is ours to shape-and that our inherited ideals must be the birthright of all of our children. That's what today is all about: _ Thank you, God bless you."	['The persistent efforts of all Americans.']
What was the author's initial attitude to geocaching?	When I first heard about geocaching ,I was skeptical. But the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like an interesting idea.I at least wanted to try it once. Having familiarized myself with how the game works,I set out in search of my first cache. My trip took me through a series of lively hutong ,past a number of small temples, and right into the courtyard of a quiet youth hotel.I spent several minutes looking around, but couldn't find anything. Just before l was about to give up,I spotted a colorful object in the crack of a wall. Could it be the hidden cache? At that moment a group of backpackers amved. According to the game's rules, people who are not in the game must not be allowed to find out about secret caches. So I pretended to make a phone call while waiting for them to leave. When the coast was clear,I grabbed the object. It was the cache! I opened it and pulled out a crumpled sheet of paper with several names and celebratory messages written on it.I added my own and replaced the cache in its hiding place, ready for the next geocacher to find. It may seem like a simple game, but the idea that there are caches hidden all around us is exciting. Once you're hooked, it's easy to set yourself the goal of finding every single cache in a neighborhood or even an entire city. The real treasure, however, is not the cache itself, but the places it takes you to. Hunting for further caches has since introduced me to places which I didn't even know existed. Some are peaceful parks, while others are forgotten historical sites.A few caches have even been in places I passed regularly without giving them any thought. Now,Ifeel a much closer connection.

Michael went into the park because he _ .	"The date was like any other day in his life. After school Michael walked past the shop on the street corner. He stopped to look at the front row of shoes. And he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have them for his birthday. He sadly walked away and thought of what to tell his mother. He knew she would give anything he liked if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home immediately, as he looked worried and his mother would notice it. So he went to the park where he sat on the grass. Then he saw a boy in a wheelchair. He noticed that the boy moved the wheel with his hands. Michael looked at him carefully and was surprised to see the boy had no feet. He looked down his own feet. ""It is much better to be without shoes than without feet."" He thought. There was no reason for him to feel so sorry and sad. He went away and smiled, thinking he was more lucky in life."	"[""didn't want to worry his mother""]"
When did the first Donald Duck film appear?	"In 1933 an unknown American called Clarence Nash went to see the film-maker Walter Disney. He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon film for children. When Walter Disney heard Nash's voice, he said, ""Stop! That's our duck!"" The duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the film, The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat and worn his sailor jacket and hat. Later that year he became a star after an eight minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audiences liked him because he was lazy and greedy, and because he lost his temper very easily. And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews. Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody, like Mickey. In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational film about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared--there were no more new cartoons. Clarence Nash died in February, 1985. But today's Children can still see the old cartoons on the television and hear that famous voice."	['In 1934']
What is the best title for this passage?	American this year will swallow 15,000 tons of aspirin, one of the safest and most effective drugs invented by man. The most popular medicine in the world today, it is an effective pain reliever. Its bad effects are ly mild and it is cheap. For millions of people suffering from arthritis . It is the only thing that works. Aspirin, in short, is truly the 20th-century wonder drug. It is also the second largest suicide drug and is the leading cause of poisoning among children. It has side effects that, although ly mild, are largely unrecognized among users. Although aspirin was at first sold by a German company in1899, it has been around much longer than that. Hippocrates, in ancient Greek, understood the medical value of the leaves and tree bark which today are known to contain salicylates , the chemical in aspirin. During the 19thcentury, there was a great deal of experimentation in Europe with this chemical, and it led to the introduction of aspirin. By 1915, aspirin tablets were available in the United States. A small quantity of aspirin (two-grain tablets) relieves pain and inflammation. It also reduces fever by interfering with some of the body's reactions.	['The Most Popular Medicine']
According to the passage, we know that Monty is a child who .	"Every month, Julia and her cousins would go to visit their grandparents. They would be excited because their grandfather would give them a few coins. Then they would buy toys and sweets. The grandparents commented that, behaving like this, the children would never learn to manage their money. So they planned a special test, in which the children would have to show, over the course of a year, just what they could manage to get with those few coins. Some thought that they would save their money, but Rubin and Nico continued spending it all on sweets. So they give up saving. Monty decided to manage his money by exchanging it: buying and selling things, or bettering it with others. Soon he surprised the whole family. He had accumulated lots of money. However, Monty was not very careful, and he got involved in more and more risky deals. A few months later he became penniless after a losing bet. Alex, had a will of iron. He saved the money and at the end of the year he had collected more money than anyone. Even better, with so much money, he had managed to buy sweets at a reduced price, so that on the day of the competition he was presented with enough sweets for more than a year. And even then, he still had enough left for a toy. He was the clear winner, and other children learnt the advantages of knowing how to save and how to wait. There was also Julia. Poor Julia didn't enjoy the competition because even though she had a wonderful secret plan, she had spent her money without giving her plan enough time to work. However, she was so sure that her plan was a good one, that she decided to carry on with it, and maybe change the expressions on her s' faces, who had seemed to be saying ""What a disaster that girl is. She couldn't manage to save anything."" When she was about to complete the second year of her plan, Julia surprised everyone by turning up at the grandparents' house with a violin and a lot of money. She did it very well."	['is lack of cautiousness']
What is the good news about wasted food according to Nierenberg?	"The Worldwatch Institute said in 2011 far too many people were living with less than they needed. It says, for example, nearly one billion people were hungry arid just as many were illiterate . Worldwatch Institute's Danielle Nierenberg said while a billion people went to bed hungry each night, it wasn't because of a lack of available food. ""We produce more than enough food in the world to feed not only the 7 billion people who are on earth today, but 9 to 11 billion people. By 2050, we expect the population to be about 9 and a half billion people and we now produce enough food to feed all of those people. But the question is really one of how do we get food to the people who need it the most. Poverty really delays the progress of allowing people to eat well. Not just getting enough basic crops, but being able to buy fruits and vegetables and the things that will really nourish them,"" she said. The director of the Nourishing the Planet Project said besides poverty and a lack of access to food, much food is simply lost. Worldwatch estimates 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted each year. ""20 to 50 percent of the global food harvest is wasted before it can ever reach people's stomachs. And this is really a moral problem when you consider all of the people who are hungry in the world. The good news about that 20 to 50 percent of global food waste number is that it's easy to prevent food waste.We can do it in our homes. Consumers can do a lot to prevent food waste by planning meals better, by not buying too much food. In the developing world there are storage systems that are beginning to be put in place that help farmers protect their food from crop diseases or molds ,""she said. Nierenberg said prevention measures can be put in place all along the food chain. While it may not seem obvious, the Worldwatch Institute project director said malnutrition and illiteracy are closely linked. ""When people, especially farmers, don't have the education that they need to live productive lives, they can't learn new skills. And in sub-Saharan Africa, women farmers, especially, don't have access to education. This prevents them from not only learning new cropping techniques and learning new technologies; it also prevents them from being able to get financial and banking services. They can't have bank accounts. They can't buy land. They can't buy the inputs that they need to make their crops more productive,"" she said. Nierenberg said despite the many challenges, Worldwatch is hopeful for the future. She says there are a growing number of new projects to address hunger and poverty, while at the same time protecting the environment."	['Global food waste can be easily prevented.']
Americans usually use motor homes _	Americans with small families own a small car or a large one. If both parents are working, they usually have two cars. When the family is large, one of the cars is sold and they will buy a van . A small car can hold four persons and a large car can hold six persons but it is very crowded . A van hold seven persons easily, so a family with three children could ask their grandparents to go on a holiday travel. They could all travel together. Mr Hagen and his wife had a third child last year. This made them sell a second car and bought a van. The sixth and seventh seat are used to put other things, for a family of five must carry many suitcases when they travel. When they arrive at their grandparents' home, the suitcases are brought into the home and the two seats can then carry the grandparents. Americans call vans motor homes. A motor home is always used for holidays. When a family are traveling to the mountains or to the seaside, they can live in their motor home for a few days or weeks. All the members of a big family can enjoy a happier life when they are traveling together. That is why motor homes have become very popular. In America there are many parks for motor homes.

"A 13-year-old Shenzhen girl has written a novel about life in junior high school, and the book is expected to hit the city's bookshelves in June, the Shenzhen Economic Dailyreported on Thursday. ""A Fresh Summer Day,"" a 180,000-character novel which Zhao Yue completed writing in three months, is in fact Zhao's second published book.

If you have a model's clothes on, you _	"Sheep always follow each other and never really think about where they are going. Perhaps fashion makes us into "" _ "". Maybe we should find our own way and not follow the crowd. Everyone wants to wear top brand clothing. However, we should remember that clothes designers study what ordinary people wear on the street. Then they make clothes like ordinary people's for everyone. Therefore, fashion really starts with individual finding a new look. Then a company uses that look and then it becomes fashionable! That doesn't mean you will. That is to say, a model might look perfect in a shirt but that doesn't mean you will. The same goes for mobile phones. Young people are always asking me when to change my mobile phones. Mobile phone companies are always putting new functions on their phones but do we really need all these extra functions? I use my phone to call people and to send messages to my friends. I don't need a camera, Internet surfing or a calendar on my phone. Again, if you buy the latest phone, it will only be the latest phone for a month or so. Then something new will come out and you'll be unfashionable again. You can't keep up with fashion all the time, so you don't need to follow the fashion."	['may not look perfect']
Diana understands the sign language well because _ .	"At a supermarket in County Durham, England, the workers are getting ready for some lessons in sign language . They are excited to meet their teacher -- two-year-old Diana Graham. The little girl will teach them how to communicate with deaf customers . Diana is a wonder child. She began to use sign language to ""speak"" to her deaf mother before she said her first word. So whenever the phone rings or there's a knock at the door, her mother can be quickly told by her. Diana understands the sign language well. Her mother even reads story books to her in sign language. Her grandmother said, ""Diana started signing at about five months. She is so clever for her age.""The supermarket officials couldn't think of a better sign language teacher for their workers. So they asked Diana to give some lessons to the workers. They hoped that her lessons would help the workers communicate better with deaf customers during their shopping."	['her mother communicates with her in it']
In the accident, the baby _ .	"The TV shows a baby's pram rolling off a train platform as the mother makes a mad rush to save her son, but she is too late and it falls onto the rails in front of an incoming train. This heart-stopping scene happened yesterday at Ashburton station in Melbourne, Australia. But the story has a happy ending: the six-month-old baby survived with just a cut on his forehead, although the pram was dragged about 35 metres by the braking train. The nurse Jon Wright said the boy just ""needed a feed and a sleep"" and didn't need to stay in hospital. ""Luckily, he was strapped into his pram at the time, which probably saved his life. I think the child is extremely lucky, "" Wright told theHerald Sunnewspaper after the baby was taken to hospital with minor injuries. Fortunately the train was already slowing down to stop at the station so it stopped quickly when the driver put on the brakes as soon as he saw the pram fall in front of him. Rail firm Connex is to look into how the pram rolled off the platform. The accident came one day after Connex started a child safety awareness activity warning parents to keep babies strapped into their prams at all times while on platforms. The accident happened at the same time as the ""balloon boy ""story in the US, in which a six-year-old Colorado boy was reported to be trapped in a flyaway balloon. However, he was later found hiding in the family's garage. Many people believe that it had all been a publicity _ by the parents. No such doubts surround the baby on the train platform."

The church clock that is a half hour slow severs as a symbol of _ .	"Just outside the northern Italian town of Bra, there rises a church tower with a clock that is a half hour slow. Though not far from the industrial city of Turin, Bra smells of roses, and leisure is the law. It is both the home of an international movement that promotes slow food and one of Italian cities that have joined the slow cities. In Bra, population 27,866, the town fathers have declared that all small food shops be closed every Thursday and Sunday. They forbid cars in the town square. All fruits and vegetables served in local schools must be organic . And as the movement goes well, the slow concept gradually spreads across Europe. The argument for a Slow Europe is not only that it is good, but also that it can work. The Slow City Movement, which started in 1999, has improved local economies by promoting local goods and tourism. Young Italians are moving from larger cities to Bra, where unemployment is only 5 percent, about half the nationwide rate. Slow food and wine festivals draw thousands of tourists every year. Shops are doing well, many with sales rising at a rate of 15% per year. ""This is our answer to the world."" says Paolo Samrnini, the founder of Slow Cities. France is in favor of slow economics. Most outsiders have long been doubtful of the French model: short hours and long vacations. Yet the French are more productive than those in the United States and Britain, and have been for years. The mystery of French productivity has risen an Europewide debate about the advantages of working more slowly."	['slow movement']
"""We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer."" The sentence showed that _ ."	"In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. ""We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer."" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The ""gentleman in white"" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel. When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross."	['Dunant had great sympathy for human beings']
What does the passage mainly tell us?	"""Spending as little as $5 a day on someone else can make you happier,"" the researchers from a team at the University of British Columbia and Harvard Business School reported. Their experiments on 600 volunteers in the US showed people were feeling happier when they spent money on others. The team asked their 600 volunteers about their income ,their daily costs, gifts for others and donations to charity. ""No matter how much money each person made, those who spent money on others could get greater happiness than those who spent money only on themselves,"" Dunn said. Dunn's team also surveyed 16 workers at a company in Boston after they received an award of between $3,000 and $8,000. ""Of course they felt happy after receiving the awards,"" they wrote in their report. ""But when they gave the people in need $5, they were happier."" ""The findings showed that as little as $5 could be enough to produce happiness on a whole day,"" Dunn said."	"['Money really can ""buy"" happiness if you spend it on others.']"
From the passage we can see the most joyful the writer think is_.	"The average man who uses a telephone couldn't explain how a telephone works. He takes for granted the telephone, the railway train , the airplane, as our grandfathers took for granted the miracles of the gospels . He neither questions nor understands them. It is as though each of us investigated and _ only a tiny circle of facts. Knowledge outside the day's work is regarded by most men as a gewgaw .Still we are usually in reaction against our ignorance.We excite ourselves sometimes and think deeply.We enjoy thinking about anything at allabout life after death or about such questions as is said to have puzzled Aristotle.""Why sneezing from noon to midnight was good,but from night to noon unlucky"".One of the greatest joys known to man is to take such a flight into ignorance in search of knowledge.The great pleasure of ignorance is.after all.the pleasure of asking questions.The man who has lost this pleasure or exchanged it for the pleasure of dogma ,which is the pleasure of answering,is already beginning to stiffen .One envies so inquisitive a man as Jewell,who sat down to the study of physiology in his sixties.Most of us have lost the sense of ignorance long before that age.We even become proud of our squirrel' store -house of knowledge and regard increasing age itself as a school of omniscience .We forget that Socrates was famous for wisdom not because he was Mr. know-all but because he realized at the age of seventy that he still knew nothing."

The funny side Momand saw in his experience was _ .	"The expression ""keeping up with the Joneses"" was first used in 1913 by a young American Arthur Momand. He told this story about himself: he began earning $125 a week at the age of 23. That was a lot of money in those days. Young Momand was very proud of his riches. He got married and moved with his wife to Long Island, outside New York City. But just moving there was not enough. For when Momand and his wife saw that their neighbors belonged to a country club they too joined a club. And when he saw that rich people were expected to ride horses, Momand went horseback riding every day. Momand and his wife also hired a servant and gave grand parties for their new neighbors. It was like a race, but one could never finish this race because one was always trying to keep up. Momand and his wife could not do that. The race ended for them when they could no longer pay for their new way of life. They moved back to an inexpensive New York City apartment. Momand later said that his experience had been a cruel awakening for him. However, he was able to see the funny side of it. He looked around him and noticed that many people do things just to keep up with their neighbors. He decided that this would make good stories for many papers across the country. He called it ""Keeping up with the Joneses"", because ""Jones"" is a very common American name. ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's stories appeared in different newspapers for over 28 years. People never seem to tire of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read the ""right"" books, go to the ""right"" universities and eat in the ""right"" restaurants. But no matter what one does, Mr. Jones always seems to be ahead."

Students in immersion programs can do the following things EXCEPT _ .	It seems more and more Americans want schools to teach foreign languages to children younger than five years old.The most popular way to teach these young children another language is called immersion . Children in immersion programs hear only the new language in the classroom.The children play games, sing songs and talk to one another in the new languages, some experts say immersion programs are the most effective way for young children to learn a language.But there can be a problem when children in the United States begin to learn another language at such an early age.Not many elementary schools continue to teach a foreign language.Only seven of the fifty states require schools to teach a foreign language to students between the ages of six and twelve.Language experts say it is easier for younger children to learn a language.Still, American schools generally do not begin to teach foreign languages until secondary schools.By then, students are about thirteen years old. American schools face difficult choices about the cost of educational programs.The government has increased support for foreign language study in its education law called No Child Left Behind. At the college, the Modern Language Association says more students than ever are studying foreign languages and more languages are being studied now than in the past.Spanish is the most widely taught in American colleges and universities.French, German, Chinese and Italian are also popular.

What did Qian Xuesen do in Shanghai?	"Qian Xuesen is one of the greatest scientists who devoted all their lives to China's science and technology. In 1911, he was born in Hangzhou, eastern China. Qian received a mechanical engineering degree in 1934 in Shanghai and went to the United States on a scholarship to study aeronautical engineering at MIT at the age of 23. As a student at MIT, and later as a scientist and teacher at the California Institute of Technology, Mr.Qian played a central role in early United States' efforts to develop jet aircraft and rocketry technology. Mr. Qian served on the United States government's Science Advisory Board during World War II. His teacher and colleague, the Caltech physicist Theodore von Karmon, praised him as ""a brain whose work will change the world greatly"". In the 1940s Qian wrote an article for a famous magazine on a winged space plane that led to develop NASA's new space shuttle. In 1955 he came back to his motherland from the US. Under his leadership, China produced its first missile called Long March, and in 1970, launched its first satellite. He was considered as the father of the country's first ballistic missiles, first satellite and the Silkworm anti-ship missile. In 2009, he died in Beijing."

With the money he got, first Hobbs _ .	"Hobbs was an orphan . He worked in a factory and every day he got a little money. Hard work changed him thin and weak. He wanted to borrow a lot of money to learn to paint pictures, but he did not think he could pay off the debts.One day the lawyer said to him, ""One thousand dollars, and here is the money."" As Hobbs took the package of notes, he was very dumbfounded . He didn't know where the money came from and how to spend it. He said to himself, ""I could go to find a hotel and live like a rich man for a few days; or I give up my work in the factory and do what I'd like to do: painting pictures I could do that for a few weeks, but what would I do after that? I should have lost my place of the factory and have no money to live on. If it were a little less money, I would buy a new coat, or a radio, or give a dinner to my friends. If it were more, I could give up the work and pay for painting pictures. But it's too much for one and too little for the other."" ""Here is the reading of your uncle's will ,"" said the lawyer, ""telling what is to be done with this money after his death. I must ask you to remember one point.

According to Pollick and Waal gestures are different from facial and oral expressions in that _ .	In 1966,Allen and Beatrice Garden, two professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, had a bright idea.They were interested in the evolution of language and the language abilities of great apes . Previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to talk had ended in failure and the matter was considered by most people to be closed. But the Gardens realized that speech and the language are not the same thing. Many deaf people, for example, are unable to speak but are perfectly able to communicate by gestures that have all the features of spoken language. The Garders suspected that previous experiments had failed because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak. They therefore decided to try teaching a chimpanzee to sign in the way that deaf people do. And their chosen _ , a female chimpanzee named Washoe after the country in which the university is, proved to be a skillful pupil. Though there is still debate about whether what Washoe learned was really equal to human language, there is no doubt that she learned a lot of words. All of this, however, raises a second question. If Washoe can learn a complex vocabulary of gestures from people, do they have such vocabularies naturally ? To examine that possibility, Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal of Emory University have looked at gestures and expressions in chimpanzees, Signaling by facial and oral expressions is common among primates . Signaling by gestures is limited to great apes. The researchers supposed that the meaning of expressions has been fixed by evolution while the meaning of gestures is learnt. If that were true, particular sorts of facial and oral expressions would occur only in particular circumstances, and this would be the same across groups and even species. The same gestures, on the contrary, would be used in different circumstances. The researchers found exactly what they expected. Expressions almost always occurred in the same circumstances in different groups and different species. Gestures seemed to have completely different meanings. Moreover, even within a single group,the meaning of a gesture could vary with circumstances. It's also worth remembering that gesture is still an essential part of human language, even for those with normal hearing. The old joke that the way to make an Italian speechless is to tie his hands together has much truth in it. Evolution does not come up with complex structures in a single leap. They are built up step by step. This study suggests that the step of speech may have been built on mental features that were acquired millions of years ago when the ancestors of apes and men began to wave meaningfully at each other.

Why didn't the old man ask the previous riders for a ride?	"It was a bitter cold evening in northern Virginia many years ago. The old man's beard was glazed by winter's frost while he waited for a ride across the river. The wait seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid north wind. It was long before he heard the faint, steady rhythm of hooves along the frozen path. Anxiously watching several horsemen coming up, he let the first one pass by without any effort to get his attention, then another passed by, and another. Finally, the last rider drew near where the old man sat like a snow statue when old man caught his eyes and said, ""Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side?"" Stopping his horse, the rider replied, ""Sure! Jump aboard."" Seeing the old man unable to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman got down to help him. The horseman took him not just across the river, but to his destination just a few miles away. As they approached the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's curiosity caused him to inquire, ""Sir, I noticed you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. Then I came up and you immediately asked me for a ride. I am curious why, on such a bitter night, you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you here?"" The old man looked the rider straight in the eyes and replied, ""I reckon I know people pretty good. I looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately found no concern for my situation. It would have been useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I looked into your eyes, your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need."" Those heart-warming comments touched the horseman deeply. ""I'm so grateful for what you have said,"" he told the old man. ""May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion."" With that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House."	['Because he assumed they had no concern for him.']

According to the passage, it is clear that _ .	"Mountain lions live in mountainous areas of the western prefix = st1 /United States. Lately, however, people have reported seeing them in quiet neighborhoods all across the country! Usually considered shy and seldom seen, these lions are becoming more noticeable. In addition, the lions appear to be moving east. They were even reported in the suburbs of Boston, Philadelphia, andChicago. It seems certain that these ""Kings of the mountains"" are moving. Why? Scientists are not sure. Some think that as the mountain lion population increases in the west, younger wild cats are leaving the area. These cats are searching for new homes and new places for food. ""The young males are looking for new homes,"" says Lynn Sadler, who is the director of the Mountain Lion Foundation in Sacramento,Calif.""People tend to create too many barriers, such as buildings, fences, roads, and noise. As the mountain lions seek new places and food and water sources, these barriers get in their way."" The sightings have made people increasingly watchful . Sometimes the ""mountain lions"" that people report seeing turn out to be large dogs or even house cats. But at least a few of the meetings have been real. The building of new roads, the growing of suburbs and the growing popularity of outdoor activities are all increasing the chances that people in various parts of the country may meet up with a mountain lion. Because many people are concerned about the reappearance of the American lion, an expert outlined some ways they can avoid attracting the wild cats: Never leave pets or pet food outside; properly care for farm animals; and plan public land use to enable the lions to move safely from one place to another. ""To be fair,"" says the expert, ""mountain lions are trying to regain their homes. They were here first. Now we need to find ways we can live together."""

Which of the following would be better to visit in summer?	"From Rome and Venice to the rolling hills of Tuscany and the charm of Milan, Italy is a bottomless well of attractions. It is a motherland of artists and scientists that changed the shape of the world. Here are some places you should see on your vacations to Italy. Valley of the Temples Welcome to Sicily and one of its most amazing attractions. The Valley of the Temples in Agrigento is an extensive archaeological site containing the well-preserved remains of various Doric temples dating from the 5thcentury B.C. In accord with standard criteria for both Greek and Roman temples, all structures face east so that the statue of the god housed inside will be illuminated by the rising sun. The site being located on a ridge overlooking the town, the term ""valley"" is obviously a misnomer ,but it quite captures the vastness of the place. Uffizi Gallery The reputation for being one of the finest universally acclaimed museums of all time comes courtesy of masters like Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo and Rubens. Their timeless works are proudly displayed on the top floor of the palace in Florence. Historic Centre of Siena Siena may not equal Florence in overall artistic achievement, but its charm makes it a place that no other can compare to. Centered on Piazza del Campo, the historic district is a container of 12th-century Gothic, and a mirror of the Middle Ages. Full of pearls of architecture and cultural highlights, the historic centre of Siena is an excellent trip back in time, ideally to be taken in summer. Grand Canal Taking the water bus along the Canal Grande is like going back through centuries of history. The famous Venetian waterway runs more than 3.5 km through all six districts of the historic center. The impressive Renaissance palaces rub shoulders with Gothic arches and marble mixes with gold. Numerous landmarks never cease to provoke admirable sighs on the way."	['Historic Centre of Siena']
Some students think it difficult to learn English well because _ .	Some students think it difficult to learn English well. That's because they don't find the right way. I think reading is very important for students. The more you read, the better you'll understand. Reading is helpful to listening, speaking and writing. If you often read English aloud, you'll improve your listening. On the other hand, listening a lot can help you to read better. Reading English everywhere when you are free, if you wish. You can get a lot of knowledge when you read. Sometimes you need to express your ideas, you can either speak or write. That means you are using what you learned from reading. The same as Chinese, the more you read, the better you can write. If you want to remember something, you should read again and again. So from now on, you'd better do more reading. It's a good way to learn English well.	"[""they don't find the right way""]"
What can we tell from the passage?	"Like the post-90s generation in China, today's teenagers in the UK have a problem with how they're represented. Most of them feel unfairly represented by the media and their lives are negatively influenced, says a recent survey. The survey was carried out by the UK Demos, in which more than 1000 14-17-year-old teens from England and Northern Ireland took part. The survey report shows that four-fifths of teens (81%) felt there was a false image of young people in the media and wider society. Most of them (85%) said that it is hurting both their self-esteem and chance of getting a job. By researching six UK newspapers over the past 10 years, Demos found that words most commonly connected with ""teenagers"" and ""young people"" were ""binge-drinking"", ""yobs"" and ""crime"". ""The young people out there are doing good things for the community, but there are always bad things on the news. But we're not all like that, it's only a few,"" said Becky Brunskill, 18, member of Youth Parliament for Liverpool. The survey also found that 80% of UK teenagers believed they cared more about social issues than the older generation. This was a view shared by their teachers, 66% of whom agreed in a separate Demos survey of 500 teachers. The UK youth are also eager to make a difference. But rather than traditional politics, 87% of the teens believed social media was a good way to change society. Jonathan Birdwell, author of the Demos report, said ""They could be the most active citizens we have seen in a generation."""	['Young Britons believe social media is a good way to change society.']
What is Melanie trying to persuade her parents to do?

Safin won his first title as a professional player in _ .	"Handsome Safin is loved by many women fans and he is called ""the most attractive man"". His strength and forehand and backhand skills are the best in the world, which are in fact unbeatable while he is at his best. Marat Safin was born inprefix = st2 /Moscowon 27th January, 1980, and was introduced to the game at a very early age. His mother Rausa, one of the former top 10 Russian women tennis players, used to take baby Marat with her when she practiced at the local Spartak club. This is where Marat also learned to play. Marat had picked up his racket almost as soon as he could walk and at five was hitting balls with a little child until 1992. When Marat was 13, his parents decided to send him abroad for further practice, so in that year Marat and his mother visited a tennis school inValenciawhere Maria Pasqual, former director of Spanish women's tennis, was asked to judge his potential. Pasqual liked what she saw and managed to persuade a Swiss client into keeping him at the school. In the following four years Marat lived in Valenciaemploying Pasqual as his career advisor, working on his great clay court skills and learning the Spanish language. Marat's first title came in 1997 at a Challenger in Espinho and soon afterwards he turned professional. He won his first title on the ATP Tour in August, 1999 when he beat Greg Rusedski in the final of the MFS Professional Championships in Boston. In 2000, Safin won his first Grand Slam title--US Open. He also reached the final of the Australian Open in 2002 and 2004. On November 7, 2004, Marat Safin beat Czech qualifier' Stepanek to win his third Paris Masters title. He also won the Paris Masters in 2000 and 2002. ""I really enjoy tennis because it brings about extreme emotions and allows me to live my dreams,"" said Safin.

Which of the following has the highest percentage of viewers?	Though the Web is becoming increasingly popular, the TV never fails to attract people. Do you know which television network is the largest in America? It is not ABC, CBS, or Fox. Nor is it one of the cable net-works such as CNN, which carries only news and news stories. It is not ESPN, the all-sports cable net-work, or even MTV, which is famous for its music videos. Rather it is PBS, Public Broadcasting System, a non-profit public broadcasting TV service. PBS has 349 member television stations in the U. S. and some member stations by cable in Canada. PBS only attracts a minority of all TV viewers, about 2 percent. The industry leader, NBC, however, attracts 11 percent of viewers. But the growth of public television in the past two decades has been dramatic. This is especially noteworthy when one considers that public television stations must often survive on very limited budgets, on viewers' donations, and on private foundations and some governmental funding. The level of quality of PBS programs, whether in national and international news, entertainment, or education, is excellent. Almost a whole generation of children throughout the world is familiar with Sesame Street and the characters of The Muppet Show. PBS is especially well known for the quality of its many educational TV programs. Over 95 percent of all public television stations have tele-courses. These courses are accepted and supported by more than 1, 800 colleges and universities throughout the US. Each year, over a quarter of a million students take courses this way.	['NBC']
What would be the best title for the passage?	"Marco Polo was from Venice, Italy. In 1271, at age 17, Marco went on a trip with his father and uncle to China. Today people often travel to different places around the world. But it was very hard for people from Europe to visit China then. After three and a half years, the Polos reached China on 1275. While he was there, Marco Polo worked for Kublai Khan, the emperor of China. He was able to learn and experience many things that were new to Europeans. In his diary, he wrote, ""Kublai Khan's palace is the greatest I've ever seen. The streets of the new capital. Daidu, are so straight and so wide."" Paper money also took him by surprise, since it was not yet in use in the West at that time. Homes were heated with ""black stones... which burn like wood."" These stones were coal, and most of the Europeans knew little about it then. After 17 years in China, Marco and his family finally returned to Venice in 1292. After he returned home, Marco completed a book about his trip, full of facts about his wonderful experiences in China."	['Marco Polo in China']

Schools should organize geography field trips to stop pupils from sitting before computer screens for a long time. And children should be encouraged to see the natural world and study geography,"" says Michael Palin. The famous actor and writer, Michael Palin, made the comments days after a study showed that pupils in the UK were less likely to take part in science field trips than in most other developed countries. The study found that 13% of schools in the UK failed to take children out of the classroom regularly. Mr. Palin said that field trips were an important part of geography and that he was interested in geography because he had a good geography teacher and he had many opportunities to ""get out of the school building"". In an interview, Mr. Palin said, ""It was important for children to see things for themselves and learn about the rest of the world. You have to show them a mountain, show them a factory, show them a power station."" Mr. Palin had been to the North and South Poles, the Himalayas , the Sahara and Eastern Europe.

""It's related to everything we do: what we eat, what transport we take to work, where we live, what houses are made of, and so on.""

One morning there was a knock on John' door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. ""I'm looking for a few days' work,"" he said. ""Could I help you?"" ""Yes,"" said the older brother. ""I do have a job for you. Look across the creek at that farm. That's my neighbor, in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow between us and he took his bulldozer to the levee and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll go him one better. I want you to build me a fence--an 8-foot fence --so I won't need to see his place anymore. Cool him down, anyhow."" The carpenter said, ""I think I understand the situation. I'll be able to do a job that pleases you."" The older brother had to go to town for supplies, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing. About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge-- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work-- and his younger brother was coming across, his hand outstretched. ""You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done."" The brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. ""No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,"" said the older brother. ""I'd love to stay on,"" the carpenter said, ""but, I have so many more bridges to build."""

The dress codes are mainly a problem for female students because _ .	"On her first day back at school in August, Stephanie Hughes, a teenage student, was sent to the principal's office at Woodford County High School in Kentucky, US and her mom was called to school. She had made a ""huge"" mistake-at least in the eyes of the school-by wearing a top that showed her collarbone . It was against the school's _ . ""This is ridiculous!"" Stacie Dunn, Hughes's mom, wrote on the social media site Facebook. ""Something needs to change!"" The incident has become an Internet sensation. Across the US, schools like Woodford are being criticized for their dress codes. Some say the rules are especially unfair to young women. Over half of US public schools have a dress code, and they are often different for girls and boys, according to the National Center for Education Statistics in the US. Some dress codes, for example, ban skirts and ask for pants to be at least knee-length. Some have pointed out that these rules are mostly for female students. Women's clothes are usually cut to be more fitted and shorter, while men's clothes are longer and looser. In practice, more women will be caught breaking dress codes. The New York Post reported that last year, one school in Staten Island, New York gave 200 dress code detentions in two weeks-90 percent of which went to female students. Some school administrators say they simply want students to dress professionally to prepare students for their future careers. But others have told female students that their clothes present a ""distraction"" to male students. That idea is being criticized. The ""distraction"" argument is unfair to women, critics say. It suggests that exposed skin means that you want criticism or sexual advances. ""These dress codes mean that girls are getting very clear messages that men have a right to your body in public spaces and it's socially acceptable, but you will be punished,"" Laura Bates, a co-founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, a project that aims to promote equality between men and women, told The Atlantic. Some students have taken action to change the situation. They have started online campaigns and made short films to build public support. Certain schools have now chosen to think again about their dress codes with parents and students. Even Woodford County High School-home of the ""collarbone"" ban-is thinking again about its policies. But, at least for now, the dress code debate is far from over."	"[""women's clothes are often short and fitted""]"
If we say some is in a dilemma, we probably mean he/she _ .	"At the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, the sport of canoe racing was added to the list of international competitions. The favorite team in the four-man canoe race was the Unites States team. One member of that team was Bill Havens. As the time for the Olympics neared, it became clear that Bill's wife would give birth to their first child about the time that the US team would be competing in the Paris games. In 1924, there were no jet airliners from Paris to the Unites States, only slow ocean-going ships. Bill found himself in a _ . Should he go to Paris and risk not being at his wife's side when their baby was born? Or should he stay with his family? Bill's wife insisted that he go to Paris. But after much soul searching, Bill decided to stay at home, where he could support his wife when the child arrived. As it turned out , the Unites States four-man canoe team won the gold medal in Paris. And Bill's wife was late in giving birth to their child. In fact, Bill could have competed in the event and returned home in time to be with her when she gave birth. People said ,"" what a shame!"" The child finally born to Bill and his wife was a boy, whom they named Frank. Twenty-eight years later, in 1952, Bill received a telegram from Frank. It was sent from Helsinki, Finland, where the 1952 Olympics were being held. The telegram read, ""Dad, I won. I am bringing home the gold medal you lost while waiting for me to be born."" Frank had just won the gold medal for the Unites States in a rowing event, a medal his father had dreamed of winning but never did. When people asked Bill about his decision he made twenty-eight years ago, he said he would make the same choice if he was in such a situation again."	['has to make a difficult choice']
According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	"In South America, the rich soil of the Amazon River basin in Brazil is known as ""black gold"". Scientists found that the secret of this rich soil was charcoal . Local people made it from animal bones and tree branches. They mixed the charcoal with the soil about 1.500 years ago. Now, scientists in the United States have done a modern demonstration. They say charcoal fertilization offers a revolutionary way to improve soil quality for hundreds or even thousands of years. Mingxin Guo and his team at Delavare State University heated tree leaves, corn stalks , small pieces of wood and poultry waste into ""biochar"" . They reported their findings at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans. Biochar could be good news for farmers with poor soil and hungry populations to feed. Professor Guo says it could even help against global warming. Intensive farming and overuse of chemical fertilizer give out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biochar does the opposite, he says. It traps carbon in the ground. The researchers planted winter wheat in containers of soil in a greenhouse -- some with biochar, some without. Professor Guo says the wheat grows much better in the pots with biochar. The soil was added two percent charcoal to. But he says even a one percent treatment will increase productivity. The results demonstrated that biochar can increase organic matter in soil. Loss of nutrients in soil is an increasing problem worldwide as farmers try to grow more food for growing populations. Next, the team will carry out a five-year study of biochar with spinach , green peppers and tomatoes. Mingxin Guo says he learns about the ""black gold"" in Brazil from a magazine story. He explains that it was discovered in the jungle, in the area where waters flow to the Amazon, in the 1960's. But it was not until recent years that scientists began to bring public attention to it."

Which of the following is not allowed in Britain?	"Visiting a pub is one of Britain's oldest forms of entertainment. The idea for the first public houses was brought to Britain thousands of years ago by the conquering Roman army. The first pubs served only wine, but after the discovery of hops in the fourteenth century, pubs began to serve mainly beer, as they do today. Today, there are 61,000 pubs in the United Kingdom. One of the oldest, Fighting Cocks in ST. Albans, Herts, is located in a building that dates back to the 11thcentury. Modern pubs are often owned by English breweries and serve only their owner's products. British pubs are required to have a license, which is difficult to obtain, and operate between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. every day except Sunday, when they must close at 10:30 p.m. The drinking age in Britain is eighteen, but fourteen-year-olds may enter a pub unaccompanied if they order a meal. Children may enter a pub with their parents until 9 p.m., which lets families enjoy reasonably priced pub meals together and allows pubs to continue in their traditional roles as community centers. Customs in British pubs differ from those in American bars. In Britain, you must go to the bar to order drinks and food and pay for your purchase immediately, there is no table service. Bartenders are called ""landlords"" and ""barmaids"" and they do not expect frequent tipping. To tip a landlord or barmaid, it is customary to tell him to ""buy himself one"". He or she may or may not take your tip on your offer. At the end of a visit, a polite customer will return his glass to the bar."	['Children of about 15 drinking in a pub with adults.']

About Dr. Roman Gerodimos' experiment, we know that _ .	"Are you a media addict who would go mad after two hours without TV, friend requests, exciting online games and your mobile - or would you easily survive? Recently, university students around the world were asked to volunteer in a global experiment called Unplugged. It was designed to see how young people would react if they were asked to observe a total media ban by unplugging all forms of media devices for 24 hours. Unplugged is being run by Dr Roman Gerodimos, a lecturer in Communication and Journalism at Bournemouth University. The experiment is now over but he doesn't yet know the full findings. However, during the experiment, Dr Gerodimos said there were already signs of how much the exercise affected volunteers. He said: ""They're reporting withdrawal symptoms , overeating, feeling nervous, isolated and disconnected."" During their 24-hour painful experience, three of the experiment's guinea pigs had to endure one intrusion from the media: a BBC reporter plus cameraman who followed them around for the day. They were asked to write down 100 lines about their day offline, but of course, they all waited until the next day when they had access to their laptops. Elliot Day wrote: ""Today, my whole morning routine was thrown up into the air. Despite being aware of the social importance of the media, I was surprised by how empty my life felt without the radio or newspapers."" From Caroline Scott, we read: ""I didn't expect it, but being prevented from the media for 24 hours resulted in my day-to-day activities becoming so much harder to carry out than usual... I didn't break out in a cold sweat like our lecturer expected us all to, but it's not something I would like to do again!"" And Charlotte Gay wrote: ""I have to say the most difficult item for me to be without has been my mobile; not only is it a social tool, it's my main access point of communication."" Earlier in the year, a UK government study found that in the UK we spend about half our waking hours using the media, often plugged into several things at once. And a recent study by Nielson found that on average, US teenagers send and receive over 3,000 texts per month ---that's about six texts per waking hour. So, with technology continuing to develop at an alarming rate, how much time will you set aside for sleep in the future?"	['volunteers felt uncomfortable in it.']
According to Dr. Andy Field, if a child is afraid of a cat, parents should _ .	"Almost every child is scared of something, from monsters in the cupboard to dogs in the park. But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: ""Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge."" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a""scaredy cat"". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: ""You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'."""

According to the researchers, living near the sea _ .	Living near the beach may come with an extra perk : better health. A new study analyzed information from more than 48 million people in England and found that the nearer they lived to the coast, the more likely people were to report good health within the past year. Living near the coast may be associated with better health because the seaside environment reduces stress, the researchers said. They pointed to another British study that found that people who took trips to the coast experienced more feelings of calmness and relaxation than those who visited urban parks or the countryside. The difference from living near the coast was relatively small. But a small effect, when applied to an entire population, can have a substantial impact on public health, said study researcher Ben Wheeler of Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry in Exeter, England. However, it's too soon to advise people to hit the beach to improve health, Wheeler said. The study only found an association, not a cause-effect link, and it's possible that other factors could explain the results. For instance, it could be that people who are wealthier, and therefore healthier, are more able to move to desired locations such as the coast, Wheeler said, a phenomenon known as the migrant effect. But the study did find that the association between coastal living and better health was strongest for those living in the poorest areas, which perhaps indicates that wealth cannot explain the results, Wheeler said. Because the study looked at only England--an island country in which everyone lives within 72 miles of the coast--it's not clear whether the findings would apply to other populations. Far from England, a health expert not involved in the study said that while the British research certainly doesn't prove that people's health and the place they live are linked, it's possible that _ to the seas does something for our bodies. If future studies confirm the results, the next step would be to find out it is what coastal environments that can benefit health. Wheeler said it may then be possible to bring those benefits to people living in other areas, through virtual environments, for instance.	"[""can help get over one's stress""]"
What does this passage mainly tell us?	Bananas are one of the world' s most important food crops. They are also one of the most valuable exports. Bananas do not grow from seeds. Instead, they grow from existing plants. Bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on a farm are copies of each other. They all share the same genetic weaknesses. For example, the Cavendish banana is most popular in North American and European markets. However,some kinds of fungus organisms easily infect the Cavendish. Black Sigatoka disease affects the leaves of Cavendish banana plants. The disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant' s leaves. Farmers put anti-fungal chemicals on their crops up to once a week. Another fungal disease is more serious. Panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant. There is no chemical treatment for this disease. Infected plants must be destroyed. Panama disease has affected crops in Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. There is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the Americas. This could threaten an important export product for Central and South America. The International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain supports research on bananas. The group has headquarters in France and other offices in the major banana-growing areas of the world. The group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas. The group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana. In fact, there are five hundred different kinds of bananas. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has said that the Cavendish banana represents only 10% of world production. The U.N. agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas. This protects against diseases that affect only one kind. Experts warn that disease may cause the Cavendish banana to disappear. This happened earlier to another popular banana because of its genetic weakness against disease.	['The risk to a popular banana shows need to grow other kinds.']
Why does the writer mention Thomas in the passage?	"American teenager Thomas Cheatham had planned to study Latin during his sophomore year at Hebron High School in Texas. But when he learned that the school district was going to offer a Mandarin class, he quickly changed his mind. ""I thought it (Mandarin) would be more beneficial than Latin,"" said Cheatham, who is now in his second year of studying the language. He speaks Mandarin to order food at Chinese restaurants and can read Face book posts from his Chinese-speaking friends. While it'a difficult language to master, the high school junior, who plans to study computer engineering, thinks it will be a valuable thing in his career. ""Chinese is a good language to know, especially with China becoming a growing power,"" he said. Many experts agree that proficiency in a language spoken by a billion people worldwide will give American students an edge in the global economy. ""People are looking at China as our next economic competitor, and interest in Mandarin is growing,'' said Marty Abbott, executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. ''We're seeing it in all parts of the country."" The number of students studying Mandarin in public schools nationwide in grades 7 through 12 grew from 20,000 in 2004-2005 to 60,000 three years later, according to the council's most recent survey. Abbott estimates that as many as 100,000 students are now studying Mandarin, in public and private schools, throughout the nation. She said the US government has considered Mandarin to be an ""important needs"" language and provides professional development programs for teachers. ""Our government wants to increase our language ability for national security and economic competitiveness,"" Abbott said. At the same time, the Chinese government is spreading knowledge of the Chinese language and culture through Confucius Institutes established in many states. The Confucius Institute at the University of Texas in Dallas, founded in 2007, opens Confucius Classrooms at 11 local public and private schools where more than 700 students are learning Mandarin."

Some students' faces turned red because _ .	"Mr. Weeks is fifty years old. He's taught maths in a middle school for twenty years. He works and always comes to his office on time. He hopes his students will be honest and he is strict with them. Some of his students have become famous persons, but they still remember him and often write to him. Of course the man is proud of them. This term he began to teach Grade One. Some of the new students were told about him, but the others didn't know about him. On the first day of school he told the students how to be an honest person. He gave them some examples and said, ""I don't like telling a lie."" Before class was over, he told all his students to finish Exercise 8 in Lesson 1. The next morning, as soon as he came into the classroom, he asked. ""Who's finished Exercise 8?""

What did the wife really want?	"An eighty-year-old couple were having trouble with their memories . One day, they decided to see a doctor. The doctor told him that there was nothing serious, but he suggested that they should start writing things down to help them remember things. The couple thanked the doctor and left. Later that night while watching TV, the old man got up from his chair and his wife asked, ""Where are you going?"" ""To the kitchen.""he said. ""Will you get me an ice-cream?"" asked the wife. ""Sure."" Then his wife asked him to write it down. ""No, I can remember that,"" replied the husband. ""Well, I also want some strawberries and cream on top. You'd better write it down, or you will forget that,"" said the wife. ""No, I can remember that,"" the husband got a little unhappy and went into the kitchen. After about 20 minutes, the husband returned with a plate of fish. The wife laughed, ""Haha! Your bad memory! I wanted some bread with cream."""	['An ice-cream with some strawberries and cream']
According to the passage, we can infer that Ms Calland intends to _ .	"Parents are creating an ""I want it now"" generation by satisfying children's every demand at Christmas, say experts. Youngsters in Britain are becoming increasingly selfish, claim the education analysts. Behavioral consultant Chris Calland said: ""Parents want to make Christmas into magical fairytale for their kids. ""There's nothing wrong with that. The problem arises when it means always giving into all our children's demands--- even if they are beyond our price range or not age-appropriate."" Ms Calland, who runs ""Santa Says No"" style sessions with colleague Nicky Hutchinson, added: ""Many of us go into so much debt providing the gifts our children want that we spend the rest of the year paying off the bills. But so often the gifts we've carefully wrapped, once opened, are just pushed away because the very thing our little boy or girl was once so desperate for, they have now lost interest in."" Ms Calland and Ms Hutchinson have drawn up a list of guidelines to help parents manage their offspring's Christmas lists this year. They say that adults can actually improve their relationships with their children by resisting ""pester power"". Ms Calland said: ""All too often we say yes because we want an easier life when the fact is that we're only building up problems for the future. We are helping create a generation of youngsters who are blind to the needs of others and the necessity of hard work. ""Children learn fast--- if we sometimes change our mind, they quickly realize it might be worth lying on the floor and screaming for it. Make sure you and your partner are working together on this. Be consistent. And try not to get caught up in competition with other families or friends."	['give advice to parents.']
For people who lack Vitamin B-twelve, they can eat more from _ .	Now, we know that if we do not get enough vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. As a result, vitamin supplements ,though expensive, are popular with people who worry that they are not getting enough vitamins from the foods they eat. But contrary to what many people think, medical experts have found little evidence that most supplements do anything to improve health or protect against disease. In fact, medical experts warn that taking too many of some vitamins can be harmful. For example, too much vitamin E can cause bleeding. People should discuss what vitamins they take with their doctors, as some vitamins can produce harmful side effects when mixed with medicines. Experts, however, do say that sometimes vitamins can help prevent disease. People who know they lack a particular vitamin should take vitamin supplements. Some older adults, for example, may not have enough vitamin B-twelve. This is because, as people get older, their body loses its ability to take it from foods. Also, people who spend much time inside may need some extra vitamin D as the skin makes this vitamin from sunlight. Different vitamins are found in different foods. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil. It also is in the yellow part of eggs. Sweet potatoes, carrots and other darkly color1ed fruits and vegetables contain substances that the body can change into vitamin A. Vitamin B-twelve is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, like fruits. Vitamin K can be found in pork products. In fact, for most people, a balanced diet can ensure enough of the vitamins our bodies need. So, it is important for us to eat a mixture of foods every day to ensure that we get enough vitamins our bodies need.	['green leafy vegetables']
What helped Yoshiyuki Morioka come up with the idea?	Those accustomed to looking through thousands of books in big bookstores may find Japan's Morioka Shoten a little strange.That's because this tiny bookstore that is located in luxury shopping district of Ginza,in Tokyo offers just one title to its customers. Opened in May 2015,Morioka Shoten(Japanese for bookstore)is the brainchild of Yoshiyuki Morioka.The experienced bookseller began his career as a bookstore clerk in Tokyo's Kanda district before branching out to open his own store.It was here while organizing book readings that he realized that customers usually came into the store with one title in mind.Morioka began to wonder if a store could exist by selling many copies of just one single book.In November 2014,he partnered with his two friends,to establish a unique bookstore with the idea'A Single Room,A Single Book.' Like its offering,the bookstore is simple.The selections that are picked by Morioka change weekly and vary widely to attract customers with different interests.Recent choices include The True Deceiver,all award-winning Swedish novel by Tove Jansson,Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales.and a collection of artist Karl Blossfeldt's photography of plants.Morioka has also displayed books written by famous Japanese authors Mimei Ogawa and ito Akagi. To highlight his single offering,Morioka often uses clever methods.For example,when selling a book about flowers,he decorated his shop with the ones that had been mentioned in the book.He also encourages featured authors to hold multiple talks and discussions so they can connect with customers.Morioka says his ultimate goal is for the customers to perience being inside a book,not just a bookstore! Risky as the idea might seem,things appear to be going well.Morioka says he has sold over 2,100 books since he opened it.Things can only get better given that his bookstore is becoming increasingly popular not just among the locals but also visitors from other countries*	['The experience of organizing book readings.']
What can we learn from the passage?	"One night, the first floor of the house suddenly caught fire. The fire was big, and soon became a sea of fire. On the second floor lived a little girl and her grandmother; the little girl's parents had died, and she lived together with her grandma. In order to rescue the little girl, the grandmother was burned to death, leaving the little girl crying for help loudly. How could people enter the house? At the very moment, a man carrying a ladder rushed to the flames and got into the window. When he appeared again in the eyes of the people, the little girl was in his arms. He gave the child to the crowd, and then disappeared into the night. This little girl had no family. Two months later a meeting was held to find a person to adopt the girl. A teacher was willing to adopt this child, and said she could give her the best education; a farmer wanted to adopt this child, saying that village life would let the child grow up healthily and happily; a rich man said, ""I can give the child everything that others can do."" A lot of people who wanted to adopt this child said about many benefits of their adopting the child. But the little girl's face had no expression. At this time, a man, through the crowd, walked straight in front of the little girl, and opened his arms for the little girl. People were puzzled, and they found that the man had terrible scars on his arms. The little girl let out a cry, ""This is the man who saved me!"" She suddenly jumped up, and buried her face in his arms and sobbed. Naturally the man adopted the girl."	['The girl recognized the man and was happy to be adopted by him.']
What can we learn from the text?	"The London 20120lympics are being praised as a sporting and logistical success,but the influence on economy is far less certain.Some London tourist attractions,businesses and hotels reported that their business actually fell during the Games.But as Olly Barratt reports from London,the overall UK economy is looking for long-term results.

According to researchers, teenagers with a bedroom TV may have all of the following problems EXCEPT _ .	"Teenagers with a bedroom television tend to have poorer diet and exercise habits and lower grades in school than those without one, US researchers said on Monday. While many studies have examined TV viewing habits of young people, researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health said little had been known about the effects in particular for older teenagers of having a bedroom TV. They questioned 781 teenagers, aged 15 to 18, in the Minneapolis area in 2003 and 2004. Of them, 62 % reported having a television in their bedroom. Not surprisingly, those with a bedroom TV were more likely to watch it a lot, clocking four to five more hours in front of a television per week, the researchers said. Many more teens with a bedroom TV were classified as heavy TV watchers than those without one. Girls with a bedroom television reported getting less exercise -- 1.8 hours per week compared to 2.5 hours for girls without a TV. They also ate fewer vegetables, drank more sweetened drinks and ate meals with their family less often. Boys with a bedroom TV reported having a lower grade point average than boys without one, as well as eating less fruit and having fewer family meals. ""It is clearly important not to allow your child to have a TV in the bedroom,"" said Daheia Barr-Anderson, one of the researchers. ""When you upgrade your TV in the living room and you have this smaller TV that's out of date but still usable, you should really resist putting it in one of your children's bedrooms,"" she said in a telephone interview."

Statistical analysis in this passage is conducted by _ .	"In Google's vision of the future, people will be able to translate documents instantly into the world's main languages with machine logic, not expert linguists, leading the way. Google's approach, called statistical machine translation, differs from past efforts in which it does without language experts who program grammatical rules and dictionaries into computers. Instead, they feed documents humans have already translated into two languages and then rely on computers to decide patterns for future translations. Though the quality is not perfect, it is an improvement on previous efforts at machine translation, said Franz Och, 35, a German who heads Google's translation effort at its Mountain View headquarters south of San Francisco. ""Some people who have been in machine translations for a long time see our Arabic-English output, and then they say, that's amazing; that's a breakthrough ."" Said Och. ""And then other people who have never seen what machine translation was read through the sentence and they say, the first mistake here in Line Five-it doesn't seem to work because there is a mistake there."" But for some tasks, a mostly correct translation may be good enough. Speaking over lunch this week in a Google cafeteria famed for offering free, healthy food, Och showed a translation of an Arabic Web news site into easily digestible English. Two Google workers speaking Russian at a nearby table said, however, that a translation of a news site from English into their native tongue was understandable but a bit awkward. Och, who speaks German, English and some Italian, feeds hundreds of millions of words from parallel texts such as Arabic and English into the computer, using United Nations and European Union documents as key sources. Languages without considerable translated texts, such as some African languages, face greater obstacles. ""The more data we feed into the system, the better it gets."" said Och, who moved to the United States from Germany in 2002. The program applies statistical analysis, an approach he hopes will avoid diplomatic embarrassing mistakes in diplomatic situations, such as when Russian leader Putin's translator annoyed then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder by calling him the German ""Fuhrer (""leader"" in English),"" which is forbidden in that context because of its association with Adolf Hitler. ""I would hope that the language model would say, well, Schroeder is...very rare but Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schroeder is probably 100 times more frequent than Fuhrer and then it would make the right decision."" Och said."	['counting how frequently a word is used in the language']
The best title for this passage may be _ .	"For years and years people have been saying that railways are dead. ""We can do without railways,"" people say--as if cars and planes have made railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, lose money and are dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, railways have become highly _ with cars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they're cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, a railway takes you from the heart of a city center. It doesn't stop you as a car does on crowded roads. And no plane or car can ever carry as many goods as one train does. Far from being dead, railways are much alive. Modern railway lines give you a comfortable journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep comfortably, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are traveling at the same time? And we are only the beginning, for we have just entered the age of super-fast trains, which are traveling 150 miles an hour and more. Soon we will be wondering why we spent so much on highways and planes we can't fly in because we don't have enough money to buy the oil."	['Railways, not the End, but the Beginning']
Why did Jerry want to buy a gun?	Jerry Baldwin was 63 years old. He was manager of a pizza restaurant in America. He lived in an apartment about one mile north of the restaurant. He walked to and from the work. When it was rainy, he took the bus. Jerry loved gangster movies. When a new one came out, he would go to the theatre and watch the new movie three or four times. Jerry would also buy videos at Barney's Video Store. Jerry had a home collection of over 1,000 gangster videos. Old ones, new ones, color, black and white, English, Spanish, Japanese - he loved them all. He could tell you the names, the directors, the stars and all the details of the movies. And then he would invite you to his place to watch a gangster film some time. He was a nice man. Jerry finally decided that he would like to own a gun, just like the gangster. So he saved money for some months. Then he went to a gun store and bought a used revolver for $ 300. While there, he also bought a lot of bullets . The following Saturday morning, he went to the gun club for only ten minutes when the accident happened. The gun went off, and the bullet went into Jerry's right knee.	['Because he wanted to be a person like a gangster.']
Which of the following CANNOT describe Jane's writing style?	Jane Austen was born in the English countryside more than 200 years ago. She lived a simple life. She seldom travelled. She never married and she died from illness when she was only 41. However, people all over the world remember her. Why? It is because Jane Austen is the author of some of the best-loved novels in the English language. These novels include Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. Jane completed her last novel Persuasion in 1816, but it was not published until after her death. Persuasion is partly based on Jane's naval brother. Anne, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, falls in love with Captain Wentworth, a person of a lower social position. But she breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. Eight years later, Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain. He finds Anne's family on the edge of financial ruin. Anne and the captain rediscover their love and get married. Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory , two inches square. Readers of Persuasion will see that neither her skill of delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus to English manners and morals has abandoned her in her final finished work. Persuasion has produced three film adaptations: a 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, a 2007 TV miniseries with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, and a 1971 miniseries with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall. People who are interested in Jane Austen can still visit many of the places she visited and lived. These places include the village of Steventon, although her family house is now gone. Many of the places Jane visited in Bath are still there. You can visit Jane Austen's home in Chawton, where she did her best writing, and Winchester, where she died.	['Her application of symbolism.']
Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?	Friedrich Dobl, a Yugoslav working in Germany, was fed up with traffic jams. At long weekends and holiday times when he wanted to get him quickly he always found himself behind hundreds of other cars moving slowly along the notorious foreign workers' route through Germany and Austria. How easy it all was for police and emergency services. A siren, a flashing light? And like magic everyone was out the way. Going home from work one night he passed a garage. And there in front of him was the answer to his problems. An old ambulance was for sale. The red cross had been removed. But not the flashing light, and the siren. He tried the light. It flashed magnificently. He tried the siren. That too sounded impressive. He bought the ambulance and opened up for himself a dream world of motoring. It began early in the morning, all his luggage in the back of the ambulance and motorway in Germany looking reasonably clear. Soon, as always, a long line of traffic appeared ahead. He switched on the flashing light and set off the siren. Cars swiftly slowed and pulled off the fast lane. Other cars stopped and drivers waved him ahead to an open road all his own. In record time he crossed the border into Austria. The big bluff was working. Police even waved him through the confusion caused by an accident. But then the Yugoslav made his big mistake. Until then he had only stopped for petrol. Now he was driving past a real accident, lights flashing , to late realize that it was not another traffic jam as he assumed. They stopped him, and after hearing the story of his ride across two countries fined him 12. 5 pounds.	['A quick Way Home? By An Ambulance']
How does Mommy feel about her being given away?	"Dear Maya Shao-ming, To me, June 6, 1990 is a special day. My long-awaited dream came true the minute your father cried, ""A girl!"" You are more than just a second child, more than just a girl to match our boy. You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago. Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life. More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born. And so you and your brother and I are the missing leaves on a family tree. Do they ever wonder if we exist? Before I was two, I was adopted by an Anglo couple. Fed three square meals a day, I grew like a wild weed and grasped all the opportunities they had to offer--books, music, education, church life and community activities. In a family of blue-eyed blonds, though, _ . Whether from jealousy or fear of someone who looked so different, my older brothers sometimes teased me about my unpleasing skin, or made fun of my clumsy walk. Moody and impatient, burdened by fears that none of us realized resulted from my early years of need, I was not an easy child to love. My mother and I conflicted countless times over the years, but gradually came to see one another as real human beings with faults and talents, and as women of strength in our own right. Lacking a mirror image in the mother who raised me, I had to seek my identity as a woman on my own. The Asian American community has helped me regain my double identity. But part of me will always be missing: my beginnings, my personal history, all the delicate details that give a person her origin. Nevertheless, someone gave me a lucky name ""Siu Wai."" ""Siu"" means ""little,"" and ""Wai means ""clever."" Therefore, my baby name was ""Clever little one."" Who chose those words? Who cared enough to note my arrival in the world? I lost my Chinese name for 18 years. It was Americanized for convenience to ""Sue."" But like an ill-fitting coat, it made me uncomfortable. I hated the name. But even more, I hated being Chinese. It took many years to become proud of my Asian origin and work up the courage to take back my birth-name. That, plus a little knowledge of classroom Cantonese, is all the Chinese culture I have to offer you. Not white, certainly, but not really Asian, I try to pave the way between the two worlds and bridge the gap for you. Your name, ""Shao-ming,"" is very much like mine--""Shao"" means ""little."" And ""ming"" is ""bright,"" as in a shining sun or moon. Whose lives will you brighten, little Maya? Your past is more complete than mine, and each day I cradle you in your babyhood, generously giving you the loving care I lacked for my first two years. When I pat you, I comfort the lost baby inside me who still cries for her mother. Sweet Maya, it doesn't matter what you ""become"" later on. You have already fulfilled my wildest dreams. I love you, Mommy"	['It is painful but understandable.']
Supermarket managers make the food attractive so _ .	"People in cities all over the world shop in supermarkets. When you enter the supermarket, you see shelves full of food. You walk in the aisles, pushing your shopping cart. You probably hear soft, slow music in the supermarket. This kind of music is playing to relax you and make you walk slowly. Thus, you will probably stay longer and buy more food. Where do you go in the supermarket when you first arrive? Many people go to the meat section first. This area of the store has many different kinds of meat. Some kinds are expensive and others are not. Usually, some kinds of meat are on sale. So it has a special low price. The manager of the store knows where the customers usually enter the meat section. The meat on sale is usually at the other end of the section, away from where the customers enter. If you want to buy this specially priced meat, you have to walk by the more expensive meat first. Maybe you will see something that you want to buy before you reach the cheaper, inexpensive meat. Then you will spend more money in the meat section. The diary section sells milk that is low in fat. Some supermarkets sell three different containers of low-fat milk. Each container looks different, but each contains the same product. One says ""1% fat"", one says ""99% fat free"" and one says ""low-fat"" in big letters and ""1%""in very small letters. If you look carefully you can see that all the milk has the same amount of fat, and each container is the same size. The prices of all these three should be the same. However, in many stores these three containers of milk would each have a different price. The store will make more money if a customer chooses the milk that costs the most. Most of the food in supermarkets is very attractive. People often stop to look at the products in attractive containers. But remember, many products will say, ""Buy me!"". Stop and think which ones are the best value for your money."	['the customers will buy more']
People living near the plants were asked to move away because _ .	Strong earthquakes hit the east of Japan in the afternoon of March 11, causing several meter-high tsunami , which killed more than 10,000 people in areas along the coast. Several nuclear plants at the coast were broken by the earthquake and tsunami. People living near the plants have been asked to move away. People living within 30 kilometers of the first plant are asked to stay indoors and close all windows. The breaking of the nuclear plants is causing electricity shortages in Eastern Japan. As a result, electricity is cut off for 3-hour periods in the area of Tokyo and some other areas during daytime. In order to save electricity, some shops, restaurants and tourist places in the areas are closed for some time every day. But all major airports and train lines are still open and operating. For the above reasons, tourists are _ not to visit the eastern areas in the near future. Visits to Western Japan are not affected by the event. People who plan to travel over the coming weeks and months are advised to pay attention to the situation for a few more days before making decisions.	['several nuclear plants had been broken']
From Toby's mother's words, we know that at first _ .	"In June 2013 a five-year-old boy, Toby, was walking home from school thinking about the long summer ahead. Money was tight that year and Toby's parents had told him they would not be able to afford a holiday. Instead of dreaming about foreign travel, he had been reading a book, Letter to New Zealand, where the author explains what happens in an envelope's journey from England to the other side of the world. As they neared their house, Toby asked his mum, Sabine, if he could write a letter to New Zealand. After a few more steps he was struck by an even better idea. ""Can I write a letter to every country in the world?"" Sabine says she often wonders what would have happened if she had replied differently that day. ""It was just one of those typical questions that five-year-olds have,"" she says. "" If he had asked me in the evening when I was tired, I might have refused. But as parents you realize there's a lot of power in just allowing kids to have a go. Also, it seemed a nice way to do some armchair exploration. So I told him"" Let's see how far you get."" The answer was very far indeed. Toby has since written and posted letters to all 193 UN mumber states, as well as numerous other bad-conditioned areas with comforting ones. To date he has written 681 letters- the best of which have been selected to appear in a new book called Dear World, How Are You?- although so productive is Toby' pen that the number will have risen by the time you read this. ""Writing these letters has made me realize that the world isn't actually all that big,"" he says with a grin. In the future, part of him would like to be a musical director to turn his beloved Star Wars into a ballet. Of course, he also hopes to travel the globe in person to see some of the countries where his letters have ended up. ""We're so lucky to have this wonderful world, and I hope we can live on planet Earth in peace."""	['she thought she should give her son a try']
Which of the following is true?	"Dick was a twenty-year-old man. His father was a teacher and taught chemistry in a middle school and his mother worked in a shop. They lived a happy life until his parents died one night when suddenly an earthquake broke out. Luckily his sister took him to see their aunt in the city and they did not stay at home. Everything was destroyed in the earthquake and the two children got into trouble. Thanks to their aunt who was not rich enough, they grew up but they lived a hard life. His sister was so sad that she became a nun . After he finished middle school, he was introduced to an owner of a hotel and began to work there. One day the young man fell to the ground while he was cleaning a window on the second floor. He was sent to the hospital and the doctor looked him over. One of his legs was broken and he had to be in hospital. He said to the nurse, ""I'm a poor man, madam. Arrange a third-class ward for me, please."" ""Can't anybody help you?"" ""No, madam,"" answered Dick. ""I have only a sister. She's a nun and she's poor, too."" ""I don't think so,"" the nurse said angrily. ""Nuns usually marry God.

Which of the following doubtful points is not mentioned in the passage?	"A three-year independent investigation into the September 11, 2001 attack on the Pentagon has _ new eyewitness evidence which, according to the Southern California-based researchers who conducted the investigation conclusively (and unfortunately), establishes as a historical fact that the violence which took place in Arlington that day was not the result of a surprise attack by suicide hijackers, but rather a military black operation involving a carefully planned and skillfully executed deception."" A CNN Reporter at the scene states that there is no evidence that a 757 hit the Pentagon. What hit the Pentagon? A Boeing 757 loaded with passengers and fuel right? Who was on Flight 757? According to the Flight Information there were No Arabs on it. That makes me wonder if Flight 757 actually existed at all. From the pictures and the videos, people can find that there are several doubtful points that need to be taken into consideration, for example the marker line on the grass in the satellite and ground pictures, the different colors of the smoke, the hole which the plane impacted, and the standing pylons . Also, from the comparison of the different pictures, people can find some other strange points. For example, the gear is not the matching one. The wreckage of the plane is not the one from the American Airlines. The glass on the pavement of the pole is another doubtful point. The last thing that need considering is about the collapse. One of the gif video shows the plane impacting the Pentagon. The only problem with this video footage is that it has been altered and can not be fully trusted. These crash photos and videos shown here clearly have been doctored and don't even match the physics of what happened. So where is the real video? It leaves me many questions. Is this a missile? It is a real enigma."	['the model of the plane']
What do parents worry about most according to the passage?	"When Nick Pasqua hits his bedroom after school, he's tired. The 14-year-old high school freshman from New Rochele, New York, plays computer video games online for a couple of hours, pausing only to instant-message his friends, check his blog or download a new song to his IPOD. When his cell phone vibrates , he scans the text message and fires back a reply. ""We're leagues behind,"" sighs Nick's mom, Kimberly Pasqua, 45. And many parents like her are feeling increasingly out of step with their children. The technology gap between parents and kids is widening, says Amenda Lenhart, senior research specialist for Internet & American Life Project, a research group that explores the impact of the Internet on children and families. In a series of reports released last year, researchers found that 87 percent of the prefix = st1 /United States' kids aged 12 to 17 use the Internet, compared to only 66 percent of adults. Half of those teens go online daily. Eighty-one percent play games online and 75 percent use instant-messaging. Nearly half(45 percent) have a cell phone. One out of five has a blog. Why are children increasing past their parents? Because today's kids learn to use computers by playing and think technology is fun, says Lenhart. But adults generally view computers as mere tools for work , not toys. Despite this difference, most parents realize that computers, cell phones and the like are fixtures in their children's lives. With that acceptance comes worry about what makes appropriate usage and more important, what's safe. Experts say the best way to keep up is to learn the technology for yourself. Visit blogs. Send some instant and text messages. Download music. ""This stuff may never be as necessary to your life as it is to your kids,"" says Susannah Stern, assistant professor in the Communications Department at UniversityofSan Diego, ""but you won't get their respect about online issues if you don't know what they're talking about."" Children can be great teachers, so let them show you the ropes. ""It's empowering for them to share their knowledge,"" says Stern. Once you know what's what, try to keep the lines of communication open and carefully watch what they're doing."	['Computers and cell phones may do harm to their children.']

The father may agree that _ .	"Dear daughter, As we drove off from Columbia, I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind. I want to tell you how proud we are. Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great well-rounded student you are. Your academic, artistic, and social skills have truly blossomed in the last few years. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"". I encourage you to be inquisitive, but I also want to tell you: ""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten."" What I mean by that is the materials taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. That is really what learning in college is about - this will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired, after which you must become self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life, the skills of learning will be something you cherish forever. Follow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy. Don't be trapped in what others think or say. Steve Jobs says when you are in college, your passion will create many dots, and later in your life you will connect them. In his great speech given at Stanford commencement, he gave the great example where he took calligraphy, and a decade later, it became the basis of the beautiful Macintosh fonts, which later ignited desktop publishing, and brought wonderful tools like Microsoft Word to our lives. His expedition into calligraphy was a dot, and the Macintosh became the connecting line. Enjoy picking your dots, and be assured one day you will find your calling, and connect a beautiful curve through the dots of yourself . Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience. So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny, evolve yourself into a bi-cultural talent, be bold to experiment, learn and grow through your successes and challenges. When I faced the greatest challenge and opportunity in my life in 2005, you gave me a big hug and said ""bonne chance"", which means ""good luck"" and ""good courage"". Now I do the same for you. Bonne chance, my angel and princess. May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be. Love, Dad (& Mom)"	"[""the skills of learning is very important for his daughter's life""]"
The writer wanted to buy _ for his brother at the store.	"My father died when I was 5. It was hard on us all. My brother is 8 years older than me, he began to look after my mother and me. My mother had to do a full-time job. My brother would get me up for school, and cook breakfast for me .When I was eating he would get my clothes and school bags ready and make my bed.

What does the author try to tell us?	"Salesman Ramesh lived in the southern part of India. He got his first assignment in the month of June, the start of the rainy season in the area. He was given a list of local laundry owners whom he had to approach and sell products to. He was scared and thought he wouldn't be able to fulfill the task, but he accepted the challenge as he had no other choice. The next day he started approaching the laundry owners, and within 15 days he got a really nice response. Most of them purchased his products, but they borrowed money from Ramesh to buy the products. Everyone promised to pay him back within the next 15 days. During the last week of June amidst heavy showers, he started visiting the laundry owners to collect money. Upon visiting half of them, he realized he hadn't collected a penny. After almost 14 days, on a bright sunny Monday morning, he started visiting the laundry owners once again. Suddenly, by noon Ramesh realized that he had collected the payments from almost 50% of the owners. He worked hard throughout the day, and by the end of the day he had completed 90% of his target for June and July. At last, he became the ""star performer"" for the months of June and July. Why did the laundry owners look at the sky and tell him to come the next day when Ramesh visited them? He went to a laundry owner and asked him the question. The owner said, ""This is the month of the rainy season and we have to wash the clothes, dry them off and iron them before handing them over to customers. If the sun doesn't shine, how can we dry our clothes and earn money to pay you back?"" Ramesh then realized that it was his patience and endurance that kept him going and ultimately helped him achieve success. Like Ramesh, each one of us should realize that apart from being honest and hard-working, if we can keep our patience, we are inching up the ladder of success."	['Patience leads to success.']
From the passage, we know that the coral reefs _ .	"Every year thousands of young people in England finish school and then take a year off before they start work or go to university.

Which of the following words can best describe the butterfly?	Walking down a path through some woods in Georgia, I saw a small pool of water ahead on the path. I angled my direction to go around it on the part of the path that wasn't covered by water or mud. As I reached the pool, I was suddenly attacked! Yet I did nothing for the attack. It was so unpredictable and from somewhere totally unexpected. I was surprised as well as unhurt though I had been struck four or five times. I backed up a foot and my attacker stopped attacking me. Had I been hurt I wouldn't have found it amusing. And I was laughing. After all, I was being attacked by a butterfly! Having stopped, laughing, I took a step forward. My attacker rushed me again. He charged towards me at full speed, attempting to hurt me but in vain. For a second time, I took a step backwards while my attacker paused. I wasn't sure what to do. After all, it's just not everyday that one is attacked by a butterfly. I stepped back to look the situation over. My attacker moved back to land on the ground. That's when I discovered why my attacker was charging me only moments earlier. He had a mate and she was dying. Sitting close beside her, he opened and closed his wings as if to fan her. I could only admire the love and courage of that butterfly in his concern for his mate. He had taken it up on himself to attack me for his mate's sake , even though she was clearly dying and I was so large. He did so just to give her those extra few precious moments of life, should I have been careless enough to step on her. His courage in attacking something thousands of times larger and heavier than himself just for his mate's safety seemed admirable. I couldn't do anything other than reward him by walking on the more difficult side of the pool. He had truly earned those moments to be with her, undisturbed. Since then, I've always tried to remember the courage of that butterfly whenever I see huge barriers facing me.	['Courageous.']

According to the passage, we can know _ .	In America: There are many more cars than in China. Maybe the number of cars in California is the same as the number in China. But there are fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey traffic rules strictly , and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About America traffic rules, there are many better terms , such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop line in all crossing without traffic lights(some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines); all cars must stop while meeting the stop lines. 2.Traffic lights: There are traffic lights in the crossing of the road .Cars may almost turn every direction. the traffic lights can give signals step by step including u-turn . There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe he may turn left. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (its color are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are streets in some residential areas, and no car can park at any time or any period time. 4. About the priority of passengers and cars: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. But only after passengers have passed the road and gotten the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead. In general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient and safe.	['California may have as many cars as China']
In order to raise the efficiency of the water supply, measures should be taken to _ .	Humanity uses a little less than half the water available worldwide. Yet occurrences of shortages and droughts are causing famine and distress in some areas, and industrial and agricultural by-products are polluting water supplies. Since the world's population is expected to double in the next 50 years, many experts think we are on the edge of a widespread water crisis. But that doesn't have to be the outcome. Water shortages do not have to trouble the world---if we start valuing water more than we did in the past. Just as we began to appreciate petroleum more after the 1970s oil crises, today we must start looking at water from a fresh economic perspective. We can no longer afford to consider water a virtually free resource of which we can use as much as we like in any way we want. Instead, for all uses except the domestic demand of the poor, governments should price water to reflect its actual value. This means charging a fee for the water itself as well as for the supply costs. Governments should also protect this resource by providing water in more economically and environmentally sound ways. For example, often the cheapest way to provide irrigation water in the dry tropics is through small-scale projects, such as gathering rainfall in depressions and pumping it to nearby cropland. No matter what steps governments take to provide water more efficiently, they must change their institutional and legal approaches to water use. Rather than spread control among hundreds or even thousands of local, regional, and national agencies that watch various aspects of water use, countries should set up central authorities to coordinate water policy.

What is the author's attitude toward Gao Xiaosong?	"Gao Xiaosong,the 42-year-old singer,music producer and director was three times over the legal alcohol limit when he crashed his Infiniti SUV into a car stopped at a red light in Beijing May 9. A blood test showed Gao had 243.04 milligrams of alcohol for 100 milliliters of blood,well over the 80 milligram limit within a 100 milliliters of blood. On Tuesday afternoon the man known to million for his harsh comments to participants on China's Got Talent had to face the judge himself at Beijing Dongcheng District People's Court under China's newly amended Road Traffic Safety Law. ""I've nothing to defend myself only regret,"" he told the courtroom filled with people. ""I always thought alcohol could bring me freedom,but it never occurred to me that drunk driving will rid others of their freedom. l' 11 be responsible for all the loss it has caused. This incident showed my irresponsibility for life. I'm willing to be a volunteer for my life promoting the non-drunk driving."" A day earlier at an administrative punishment hearing, wearing an orange detention suit,he was banned from driving for five years and fined 1,000 yuan for having an expired license. On May 10 he was pictured at Beijing's traffic police headquarters where he turned down requests for interviews,but wrote on a piece of paper,""sorry,never drive when drunk."" Now he has become the first celebrity to be punished under the tough new rules that came into effect on May 1. Guo Shudong,the first driver sentenced since the new law was introduced,was jailed for four months for being twice over the legal limit on May 9.

According to the passage, if all the people in the world knew a major world language, _ .	The time may soon come when we say goodbye to most of the world's languages. Today humans express themselves in over 6,000 different languages. But that is quickly changing. Many scientists say that over half of these languages will disappear within the next 50 years. After 100 years, the languages used in the world will not be more than 20. Why? It is because people from different cultures live and work together much more often than before. This brings changes. The languages of the world's main culture are replacing the languages of the smaller cultures. Most international trade takes place in world languages such as English. People respect their own cultures and traditions, but when it comes to getting a job, knowing a world language is often necessary. It may mean the difference between success and failure. Technology works on the change of languages in an even more amazing way. Modern media such as radio and television give young people in developing countries much knowledge about the world. But this knowledge doesn't come in words from the mouths of their parents or the elders in their neighborhood. It usually comes in the language of a different culture. People in different cultures think it good for them to share a popular language. They can quickly share ideas and work together. Knowing the same language means easier communication and is a basis for trust. Is the death of a small local language such a terrible thing? The answer is maybe. Many cultures may have words for many useful things we know nothing about. If their languages die, their valuable wisdom may be lost forever. The future of the world's language depends on our actions now. Will we protect endangered languages or allow them to quietly disappear? Time will have the last word.

Why did the author decide to join in the marathon?	"I am a long distance runner. When I was thirty-one, I was in a serious car accident. The doctor told me that they would try to get me to walk ""normally"" but I would never run again--terrible news for someone who views running as the oxygen she breathes. The doctors were right. For the next nine and a half years, I was unable to run more than twenty-five feet. In 2006, I began self-training to take part in a 60-mile walk. Three months into preparing, I realized that walking 4-5 hours a day was too long. If only I could jog part of it--that would cost me less time. I started jogging without my knees aching. Slowly, I increased the distance. The doctor were proved wrong--it only took nine and a half years to do so. While practicing, I suffered a loss--a dear friend suddenly died. His work had been to help women to accept themselves and reach their fullest potential . He believed that people should let nothing hold them back from achieving their goals. Soon after his death, a crazy thought entered my mind: what if I could run the LA Marathon? I knew that if I didn't train to my fullest, the doctor would win. So I trained seven days a week. And I succeeded in crossing the finish line of the LA Marathons all over the United States to the _ of my doctors. They never believed that I would achieve that. The aches and pains I experience while training and racing are nothing compared to the suffering people whom I respect must accept."	"[""Because she was encouraged by her dead friend's words.""]"

It is important for parents to be aware of their children's learning style because _ .	"We all know that good study habits are essential to success. We probably can reduce the academic dishonesty by promoting good study habits among students. Letting the students know how important good study habits are when they come to school. Still, even procrastination can be overcome by proper study habits, and improving study habits is the key to better studying. Good study habits are a great tool to have in the toolbox of life. Many of the tips for success for online students are the same as those for students in a classroom. Consider asking the school's student union to take on a study tips project. Following a few simple study tips can help students effectively learn new concepts and theories. A good way to stay organized is to use folders so that your child can keep his / her assignments. Once children reach the grades where homework and tests are part of the curriculum, there are many things parents can do to encourage good study habits. An effective way is to study before and while they do their homework. Being organized and having homework routines are the most important things in helping your child develop good habits for life. Learning, however, is a process which settles into certain steps. Students with learning problems, however, may still have generally inefficient and ineffective study habits and skills. Becoming aware of your child's learning style will help you understand why they sometimes get frustrated with common study methods. Effective study habits are a very important part of the learning process. Good study habits are all about keeping to a daily routine and giving all subjects equal treatment. If your child's study habits are weak, take a ""study skills"" course or have someone show him/her good study habits. The problem is that those high-school study habits are hard to shake. Hard work and good study habits are two characters to be nurtured . Motivation and study habits are obviously very important as well."	['it helps to know exactly what problems their children have']
where is this passage probably from?	When you are traveling, it's vital to know about the customs and etiquette(,)of the global village. What we consider polite behavior at home isn't always accepted outside our borders. * Etiquette of Gift Giving Gift giving should be a happy, positive experience. When selecting a present for someone in Netherlands, don't purchase fancy kitchen knives or scissors. Giving sharp, pointy objects as gifts is considered unlucky. Be careful when presenting flowers to a friend or a business partner in Russia. Yellow blooms suggest cheat or a relationship break up. Traditionally, red carnations are placed on the tombs of the dead. Writing cards or notes while visiting South Korea, be mindful of your pen's ink color1. Writing a person's name in red ink traditionally suggests that the person has passed away--an important point to remember when giving a birthday card. * Eating Customs Being early or on time is viewed as being rude, too eager or even greedy in Venezuela. If you are invited to someone's home for a meal, it's recommended that you arrive 10 minutes later than the requested time. When having a meal in Egypt, don't use the salt shaker . It's insulting to your host to spread salt on your food, which means that you find the meal terrible. Japan is a very polite nation, and their fondness for etiquette extends to the use of chopsticks. According to Japanese custom, if you're in the middle of eating, use the opposite end of your chopsticks to secure food from a shared plate. When doing business in Turkey, it's the custom for your host to pay for your meal. Requests to split the bill won't be accepted. If you would like to pay your fair share, Turks recommend inviting your host to a follow-up meal.	['A culture column.']
What do we know about the Marsdens?	"Campers Gene and Marie Marsden took pride in being good citizens when in the wild. While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service. Mr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp. The Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear. They all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on. The next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear. After spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree. She slapped her head and shouted, ""Oh no!"" ""What is it?"" Gene asked. Marie pointed at the ground where Spike's dog food bowl lay upside down. A week after their return home, the Marsdens read the headline in their local paper. ""Bear Killed in Wind Rivers."" According to the article, the Fish and Game Department had shot the young bear because, having been rewarded for invading a human campsite, it would likely to do so again. The Marsdens knew they had been lucky in the encounter, yet much to their shame and sadness, they also knew that the bear had not."	['They did what the bear safety handbook had said.']
What can a visitor do if he gets a Schengen visa?	"Travelling abroad for leisure is becoming more and more popular for Chinese. The UK is high up in the list of places that the Chinese want to visit. There is a sense of mystery about the UK; it's often the images of England's green parks, countryside and Victorian houses that people point to as an alternative to polluted, overcrowded cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. The capital is viewed as modern and dynamic, while being filled deep with history. When asked what other images are thought of by the UK, the reply is often ""the Queen, tea and Oxbridge"". So what's stopping them actually coming? Sebastian Wood ,the British ambassador in Beijing, has described the UK as a _ , and while this is perhaps an exaggeration ,Britain does have a reputation as a country that is harder to access. The main problem for Chinese tourists is obvious. Although visa applications are now completed online, visitors are still required to visit one of 12 UK centers across the country for a face-to-face interview and fingerprinting. If you don't live near one of these enters already, you'd have to travel some distance to get there. Another problem is also to be mentioned. If travelers from China visit the UK, they also want to cover as much ground as possible. But the UK is not included in the Schengen visa, which allows access to a host of 26 European countries such as France and Germany. So it makes the former seem a less worth it. There is also the issue of cost: PS47 for a Schengen visa, PS82 for the UK. On top of this, the UK is viewed as stricter in its handing of visas compared with the rest of Europe, fed by urban legends of rejected applications. In the end, the decision comes down to one question: Is Britain worth a visit?"	['He can only visit 26 European countries.']
Black Hawk Down is a(n) _ .	This is a true story. Tristin Saghin enjoyed the movie Black Hawk Down very much,which is about the conflict in Somalia.The battle scenes and the exciting rescues of people who are dying,interested him greatly. There was just one problem:Tristin was only 9 years old,and it was thought that movie was not for children. When his parents caught him watching it on TV,they made him turn it off,though he had finished his homework and it was not late. Then one day,Tristin and his family were visiting his grandmother in Mesa,Arizona. Tristin's 2yearold sister got out of the house and fell in the backyard pool. Realizing the little girl was missing,the family ran outside,only to find the girl had fallen into the water. Pulled from the pool and placed on the ground,the child wasn't breathing. The family called the ambulance ,but no one knew how to do first aid. No one,that is,except for Tristin. A scene in Black Hawk Down describes a doctor giving first aid. Tristin remembered it. Then the 9yearold gave first aid to his sister at once and saved her life. His parents don't stop him seeing the movies he likes any more. Tristin taught himself how to do first aid but he had never thought he could use it to save his little sister's life. Any skill can be used in time,so you should always learn.	['war movie']
Music and drama are not included in the high-school curriculum mainly because _ .	"Music died here last spring, or rather, it was killed by members of the school committee who ignored the importance of music and drama as part of the high-school curriculum. The committee decided that teaching students how to take a standardized test is more important than a curriculum in which students can explore their interests in the arts as well as academics. Because the school system is running out of funding, it needs to make sure that students pass the mastery test or even more money will be lost. If students fail the state standardized test, it is not the fault of drama and music classes-- they are failing because the "" academic"" classes are not sufficient. It is painful to think of how many students will be discouraged from singing, acting, and playing instruments because school programs are no longer offered. Many families cannot afford private music lessons, and many potential musicians and artists may not find their calling if they are not exposed to it in school. The fact that the school committee thinks the arts are not worth the investment will certainly make some students believe the arts are not worth their time or support and the cycle will continue. Teaching for a test does not shape students into complete, well rounded people. It blocks the natural sense to create and express feelings through art-- there is more to life than the analytical thinking that math and English provide. What happens after a test? Sure, a student might graduate, but they will have limited knowledge -- certainly not a good preparation for the real world."	['the school is afraid of losing financial support']
What was Napoleon's attitude to walking on the left?	About a quarter of the world drives on the left, and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies like Australia , and Ireland. But Thailand, Indonesia and Japan also do so. This strange quirk puzzles the rest of the world; however, there is a perfectly good reason . Up to the late 1700's , everybody travelled on the left side of the road because it's the most sensible option for feudal , violent societies with mostly right-handed people. Soldiers with their swords under their right arm naturally passed on each other's right, and if you passed a stranger on the road, you walked on the left to ensure that your protective sword arm was between yourself and him. Revolutionary France, however, overturned this practice as part of its sweeping social rethink. A change was carried out all over continental Europe by Napoleon. It changed under Napoleon because he was left-handed. His armies had to march on the right so he could keep his sword arm between him and any opponent. From then on, any part of colonized by the French travelled on the right. After the American Revolutionary War (1775--1783), the US became independent and decided to make traffic drive on the right in order to cast off all remaining links with its British colonial past. As America became the center of the car industry, if you wanted a good reliable vehicle, you bought American right-hand-drive cars. From then on, many countries changed out of necessity. Today, the EU would like Britain to fall into line with the rest of Europe, but this is no longer possible. It would cost billions of pounds to change everything round. The last European country to change driving on the right was Sweden in 1967. While everyone was getting used to the new system, they paid more attention and took more care, resulting in a reduction of the number of road accidents.	['Disapproval.']

In this passage the author advises us to _ .	If you want to become a better reader, here are four important points to remember about rate or speed of reading: First, knowing why you are reading and what you are reading to find out will often help you to know whether to read rapidly or slowly. Second, some things should be read slowly. Examples are directions for making or doing something; arithmetic problems, science and history books. They are full of important information. You must read such things slowly to remember each important step and understand each idea. Third, some things should be read rapidly. Examples are simple stories for enjoyment, news, letters from friends, items or bits of news from local or hometown paper, telling what is happening to friends and neighbors. Fourth, in some of your readings, you must change your speed from fast to slow, and slow to fast, as you read. You'll need to read certain pages rapidly and then slow down and do more careful reading when you come to important ideas which should be remembered.	['be better readers']
Which of the following is NOT true, when an earthquake suddenly happens?	Earthquakes can be very scary . But you need to keep your mind stable in order to make sure you are safe. Be calm and try not to run here and there. If you manage to come out of your house, go to an open space like a garden or a park where you will be a lot safer. If you live quite some floors above in your building, try to find a place near a bulky object such as a bed. Curl up and sit on the floor and make sure you are not near a window, fireplace, gas stove and so on. Remember don't use lifts or escalators. Some people say you should stand on a doorway. That is not true. If the doorway jambs are weak, they might fall on you. Also if people want to pass through that door, you may stop them. Leave all doorways free. Another important thing to keep in mind is that you mustn't climb down the stairs during an Earthquake. If the tremors stop, after a few seconds, just climb down the stairs as quickly as you can and move out of the building, but don't run. Earthquakes usually destroy gas pipes and electrical wires. Turn off the main gas. And don't light candles or lighters and create an even bigger disaster. If you're driving and feel a shake, stop your car at the side of the road and get out. Make sure you are not on a bridge. Bridges and overhead roads have the biggest danger of falling.	['Curling up may be very dangerous.']

"The first time I went for a walk around my father-in-law's neighborhood was garbage day, and I was shocked to see what people were throwing out. It was back in 1981, and I saw many people gathered in someone's front yard. As I went nearer to see what was happening I got my first introduction to yard sales. For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight. The following weekend, at another yard sale, I saw a 14-inch color1 TV being sold for almost nothing. I felt I could not miss the offer and bought it. Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to s. So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business. Every few months I would gather several boxes of American ""junk"" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home. As word got out about my father's ""trash"" market, people all came to buy these things. Three years later, when I visited my family for the first time since leaving home, I learned that many of the families in our neighborhood had a piece of ""trash"". It proved that I had the responsibility to keep people back home up to date with the latest technology you no longer need.(304words)"	['sell unwanted things in their own yards']
It is hard to raise cocoa production probably because_.	The next time you eat a piece of chocolate, be sure to enjoy it, because according to two of the world's largest chocolate makers--Mars Inc and Barry Callebaut, the treat may soon be in short supply. The problem? We are consuming the candy at a faster pace than farmers can grow cocoa. The manufacturers say that in 2013, people consumed 70,000 tons more cocoa than was produced. Experts say that this is the worst supply-demand imbalance they have experienced in more than 50 years. Parts of the reason for the condition is the large reduction in supply, caused by a continuous drought in the west African countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa is produced. Additionally, a certain disease known as frosty pod has destroyed 30 to 40 percent of global cocoa production. As a result, many farmers have turned to more profitable and easier grown crops like corn. This means that even if conditions improve, cocoa production may never get back to normal. Meanwhile, the world is only getting hungrier for chocolate. The biggest increase in demand is from the residents of emerging market countries like India. Though their consumption is nowhere close to the amount European devour, their newly acquired amount for the treat , is making a huge dent in an already tight market. There is also the growing desire for dark chocolate, which contains more than 70 percent cocoa compared to normal chocolates. Experts believe that if consumption continue at this pace, cocoa deficits could swell to one million tons by 2020 and to an even more worrisome, two million tons, by 2030. Not surprisingly, cocoa prices have risen by 60% since 2012, a cost that manufacturers have offset by raising the prices of everyone's favorite candy. As the situation worsens, the price of chocolate can only rise--so be sure to enjoy piece of the sweet treat, like it is your last!	"[""Many farmers don't grow any longer""]"
The writer went to America by _ .	"Like most English children, I learned foreign languages at school. When I made my first visit to the United States, I was sure I could have a nice and easy holiday without any language problem. But how wrong I was! At the American airport, I was looking for a public telephone to tell my friend Danny that I had arrived. An American asked if he could help me. ""Yes,"" I said, ""I want to give my friend a ring."" ""Well, that's nice. Are you getting married?"" he asked. ""No,"" I replied, ""I just want to tell him I have arrived."" ""Oh,"" he said, ""there is a phone downstairs on the first floor."" ""But we're on the first floor now,"" I said. ""Well, I don't know what you are talking about. Maybe you aren't feeling too well after your journey,"" he said. ""Just go and wash up, and you will feel a lot better."" And he went off, leaving me wondering where on earth I was: At home we wash up after a meal to get the cups and plates clean. How can I wash up at an airport? At last we did meet. Danny explained the misunderstanding: Americans say ""to give someone a call"", but we English say ""to give somebody a ring"". When we say ""to wash your hands"", they say ""to wash up"". And Englishmen start numbering from the ground floor so the first floor is the second for Americans."	['plane']
Why didn't the writer reply to his father?	"Some people are so rude! Who sends an e-mail or a text message that just says ""Thank you""? Who leaves a voice mail message rather than texts you? Who asks for a fact easily found on Google? Don't these people realize that they're wasting your time? Maybe I'm the rude one for not appreciating life's little politeness. But many social agreed standards just don't make sense to people drowning in digital communication. In texts, you don't have to declare who you are or even say hello; E-mail, too, is slower than a text; Voice mail is a now impolite way of trying to connect. My father learned this lesson after leaving me a dozen voice mail messages, none of which I listened to. _ , he called my sister to express his dissatisfaction that I never returned his phone calls. ""Why are you leaving him voice mails?"" my sister asked. ""Just text him."" In the age of the smartphone, there is no reason to ask once-acceptable questions about: the weather forecast, a business's phone number, or directions to a house, a restaurant, which can be easily found on Google Maps. But people still ask these things. And when you answer, they respond with a thank-you e-mail. How to handle these differing standards? Easy: Consider your audience. Some people, especially older ones, appreciate a thank-you message. Others, like me, want no reply. The anthropologist Margaret Mead once said that in traditional societies, the young learn from the old. But in modern societies, the old can also learn from the young. Here's hoping that politeness never goes out of fashion but that time-wasting forms of communication do."	['He liked text messages better.']
In Britain, most national papers give their voices for _ .	British Newspapers In Britain there are 11 national daily newspapers and most people read one of them every day. There are two kinds of newspapers. One is large in size and has many detailed articles about national and international events. These newspapers are called the serious papers or the quality papers. The other kind, called the tabloids , is smaller in size. They has more pictures and shorter articles, often about less important events or about the private lives of wellknown people. Although some people disapprove of the tabloids , more people buy them than buy the serious newspapers. The Sun, for example, which is a tabloid,is the biggest-selling newspaper in Britain. The tabloids are sometimes called the gutter press And in 1997, some photograph reporters of the tabloids were said to be involved in the tragic death of Princess Diana in France and they were criticized as gossip reporters by the public. Most national newspapers in Britain express a political opinion and people choose the newspaper that they read according to their own political beliefs. Most of the newspapers are right-wing, which means they support the Conservative Party . These are The Daily Telegraph ( serious newspaper ) , The Daily Express,Daily Mail, Daily Star, The Sun and Today ( all tabloids) . Of the other serious newspapers, The Times,the oldest newspaper in Britain,did not formerly have one strong political view but it is now more right-wing. The Independent does not support any political party, and neither does The Financial Times, which concentrates on business and financial news. The Daily Mirror^ a tabloid) is the voice of the Labour Party.	['the Conservative Party']

A most suitable title for the passage could be _ .	The popular college rankings focus primarily on prestige as measured by the SAT scores of incoming students and how many applicants are turned away. An initiative started last fall by the Obama administration could help families go beyond these limited, and far too easily exploited, indexes to learn quickly and easily how a college is compared with its competitors nationally on important criteria like graduation rates, what a degree actually costs and how much debt a student can expect to run up by graduation day. If the federal government makes it legally necessary to disclose this information in a clear and consistent way, as it should, families will be better able to make informed college choices. And this will help put pressure on colleges that perform poorly to improve. Critics may regard this initiative as an example of government overreach. But given that the federal government spends nearly $190 billion a year on higher education aid to students, it has a legitimate interest in making sure that the money flows to the schools that best meet their responsibilities to families and students. Congress has taken some steps to require greater transparency from colleges. The 1990 Student Right to Know Act, for example, required colleges and universities that receive federal aid to disclose graduation rates. And the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act required schools to offer a way for consumers to determine actual costs after student aid is taken into account. But many colleges have done a poor job of obeying federal disclosure rules, and much of the available information is not in one place. The administration's new efforts would enforce reporting requirements and provide some new tools. President Obama wants to expand campus-based aid to about $10 billion from the current $2.7 billion. He has proposed moving money away from colleges that fail to control tuition increases or provide good value to others that do a better job. That is a worthy idea in principle, but he will need strong data-based evidence to determine how colleges are doing. The transparency initiatives are a good place to start and should be embraced by both parties in Congress. If students and families, facing higher tuition and rising debt, are to make sound choices, they need more and better information.	['What College Parents and Students Need to Know']

We can conclude that in the Netherlands cycling is _ .	"In the Netherlands,cycling isn't seen as eccrfriendly exercise; it's part of everyday life, as it's people's top choice to school and work. There are more bicycles than residents in the Netherlands. In cities like Amsterdam and The Hague, up to 70 percent of all journeys are made by bike. So how did cycling become such a popular means of transportation in the European country? In the 1970s, the Dutch government began to improve its cycling infrastructure due to both a social movement demanding safer cycling condition for children and the oil crisis in the Middle East, when oil producing countries stopped their exports to Western Europe. To make cycling safer and more appealing, the Dutch have built the widest cycling net- work in the world. The country has over 40,000 kilometers of bicycle lanes and paths,which are clearly marked. They have smooth surfaces,separate signs and lights for those on two wheels. The lanes are wide enough to allow side-by-side cycling and passing. In many cities the bike lanes are completely segregated from motorized traffic. And in many traffic situations cyclists are given priority over drivers. Sometimes, where space is limited and both must share, you can see signs showing an image of a cyclist with a car behind accompanied by the words ""Bike Street:Cars are guests"". As young people aren't allowed to drive alone until they are 18,cycling offers Dutch teen- agers an alternative form of freedom. The government also makes cycling training lessons a compulsory part of the Dutch school curriculum . Bike parking facilities are ubiquitous in the country. Cyclists are accommodated in the way motorists are elsewhere. Take Groningen, a city in the northeastern part of the Netherlands,for example. The city's central train station has underground parking for 10,000 bikes."	"[""thought of as part of people's life""]"
Researchers studied the following aspects of the children except _ .	"A new study has found evidence of aggressive behavior in children who drink four or more servings of soft drinks every day. Information for the study came from the mothers of 3,000 5-year-olds. Researchers asked the women to keep a record of how many servings of soft drinks their children drank over a two-month period. They were also asked to complete a checklist of their children's behavior. The researchers have found that 43 percent of the children drink at least one daily serving of soda, and 4 percent of the youngsters have even four or more sodas to drink every day. Shakira Suglia, a famous expert, says they've found that children who drink the most soda are more than twice as likely as those who drink no soda to show signs of aggression. ""For the children who consume four or more soft drinks per day, we see more _ behaviors, which make them hard to get along well with others."" The aggressive behaviors include destroying possessions belonging to others, taking part in fights and physically attacking people. The researchers have determined the link after considering factors like the child's age and sex. They have also considered other possible influence, such as whether the boys and girls are eating sweets or giving fruit drinks on a normal day. In addition, the researchers have examined parenting styles and other social conditions that may be taking place in the home. Researches are trying to find why young children who drink a lot of soda have behavior problems. An ingredient often found in soft drinks is caffeine, which helps to make people feel energetic. Doctor Suglia suggests that caffeine could cause the 5-year-olds to be more aggressive. Earlier studies of adults have found the highest sugar levels in those who carry weapons and show signs of negative social behavior."	['games']

Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?	"I have a friend named John Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Ysidro.The last time I was there he shared a story with me. ""It is a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer. When he was a senior,he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up."" That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings,the stables and the track. ""The next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'"" ""The boy went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?'"" ""The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'"" ""The boy went home and asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.'"" ""Finally,after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.'"" John continued, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace."" He added, ""If I had changed my paper at that time, maybe we would not have the chance to be here talking about the dreams ."""	['Keep My Deam']
The author lists 13 values in his booklet to _ .	"Most Americans would have a difficult time telling you, specifically, what the values are which Americans live by. They have never given the matter any thought. Over the years I have introduced thousands of international visitors to life in the United States. This has caused me to try to look at Americans through the eyes of foreign visitors, I am confident that the values listed in this booklet describe most (but not all )Americans, and that understanding these values can help you, the international visitor, understand Americans. It is my belief that if foreign visitors really understand how deeply these 13 values are _ in Americans, they will then be able to understand 95% of American actions --actions which might otherwise appear ""strange,"""" confusing,"" or ""unbelievable"" when evaluated from the perspective (aspect) of the foreigner's own society and its values. The different behaviors of a people or a culture make sense only when seen through the basic beliefs, assumptions and values of that particular group. When you encounter (meet) an action, or hear a statement in the United States which surprises you, try to see it as an expression of one or more of the values listed in this booklet."

Which statement is true according to the passage?	Birdwatching is becoming more and more popular in many parts of the world. Birdwatchers enjoy looking for and listening to different kinds of birds.To watch birds, all you need is a pair of binoculars, a field guide and love for birds. If you are just starting birdwatching, buy one of the cheaper pairs of binoculars.You can choose better ones when your needs and skills grow.A field guide helps you leam about the birds' appearances, calls and habits before birdwatching. When you are ready, it's best to go to the wild with someone who is more experienced.You can join a birdwatching group to learn about some beginning skills.A local bird club is ideal. Start birdwatching in the morning, when birds are searching for food.Most of the time, you will hear bird calls from all around you, but will not see any birds easily.Look for movement in trees, and bring your binoculars to your eyes. The most important work for a birdwatcher is to identify the birds he/she sees.A bird's shape, size, colour and habits can help a birdwatcher identify it.When you identify a bird, don't forget to take notes about it on your notebook. To find more and different birds, you may wish to plan trips to birds' different living areas: forests, lakes, rivers, wetlands, etc. When watching the birds, you should always keep in mind: respect wildlife and protect its living areas.

Which word best describes people's attitude to oPhone's market in the future?	"Say you forgot about Valentine's Day, and it's too late to send someone some roses. Someday, you'll at least be able to send their odors . A Paris lab under the direction of David Edwards, Michigan Technological University alumnus, has created the oPhone, which will allow odors to be sent, by Bluetooth and smart phone attachments, to oPhones across the state, country or ocean, where the person who receive it can enjoy American Beauties or any other kinds of rose. It can be sent by email, tweet, or text. Edwards says the idea started with student designers in his class at Harvard, where he is a professor. Normally, he says, there's a clear end in sight, but with their project no one had a clue who was going to pay for the research or if there was even a market. With the early major buzz produced -- Wired Magazine, National Public Radio, and the British press -- Edwards is sure the market will come. ""We create odor profiles ,"" says Blake Armstrong, director of business communications at Vapor Communications, an organization operating out of Le Lab in Paris. ""We put that into the oChip that gives away that smell."" Edwards said that the original four chips that will come with the first oPhones can be combined into thousands of different odors -- produced for 20 to 30 seconds. In fact, Le Lab is working with Cafe Coutume, the premier coffee shop in Paris, using oPhones to create nice experiences. ""Imagine you are online and want to know what a particular brand of coffee would smell like,"" Edwards says. ""Or, you are in an actual long line waiting to order. You just tap on the oPhone and get the experience."" And there are other benefits. ""Fragrance houses, of course, culinary, travel, but also healthcare. ""A patient with brain damage had lost memory, and the oPhone can help bring that memory back. Improvements are already planned at the end of year--give phone to audience in 2015. ""The oPhone will finally be smaller. "" according to Armstrong."	['confident']
The passage mainly tells us that _ .	This is a doubtful age, but although our faith in many of the things has weakened, our confidence in the curative (,) properties of the bottle medicine remains the same. This modern faith in medicine is proved by the fact that the annual drug bill of the Health Services is increasing to huge figures and shows no signs at present of stopping to rise. The majority of the patients attending the medical out-patients departments of our hospitals feel that they have not received enough treatment unless they are able to carry home with them some tangible curative in the shape of a bottle of medicine, a box of pills, or a small jar of ointment , and the doctor in charge of the department is only too ready to provide them with these requirements. There is no quicker method of treating of patients than by giving them what they are asking for, and since most doctors in the Health Services are overworked and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits etc. Nor is it only the ignorant and ill-educated person who has such faith in the bottle of medicine. It is said that Thomas Carlyle (a famous Scottish writer), when he heard of the illness of his friend, went off immediately to visit him carrying with him in his pocket what remained of a bottle of medicine formerly used for a slight illness of Mrs. Carlyle's. Carlyle was entirely ignorant of what the bottle in his pocket contained or the nature of the illness from which his friend was suffering, but a medicine that had worked so well in one form of illness would surely be of equal benefit in another, and comforted by the thought of the help he was bringing to his friend, he rushed to Henry Taylor's house. History does not relate whether his friend accepted his medical help, but probably he did.	"[""people's faith in the bottle of medicine has not weakened in the modern age""]"
As with the dog Barney, people _ .	"Whenever my dog, Barney, comes into the house after having been for a ride in the car, he runs to the pen we have set up for him by the back door. It's not something we intentionally trained him to do. The habit came simply because my husband tended to put him in his pen whenever they came in. After doing it a few times, Barney just figures that's what you do when you come inside after a car ride. It's the same with your thinking. You get into the habit of thinking a certain way and then you'll rarely question it after that. This is especially true when you were growing up. You developed habits that just made things easier for you. You probably didn't even think about them. That's just the way it was and that's what you did. Just like Barney thinks he has to go into his pen, you do things automatically as well. For example, when you were a kid, you may have been told not to ""talk back"" and to just keep quiet about things that were bothering you. These are habits that might have worked to keep you safe and out of trouble when you were young. Now that you're grown up, you may be finding that these previous strategies are actually causing you problems. In a relationship, not communicating isn't going to work as your partner can't read your mind. What works when you're a child may not work when you become an adult. When you decide you need to change your thoughts, your brain may at first feel that it's not a safe thing to do. Lots of practice and years of experience says it's not. Also, you don't know to question the thought. It's a truth for you. The trick is to look at your results and see if your thoughts are the cause. Be willing to question your thinking and ask yourself if there are thoughts that are hindering you. As you are now in a different phase of your life, different strategies may be needed."

What is the main idea of the passage?	Just because you are in a wheelchair doesn't mean you can't enjoy the competitiveness --the all-around fun --that playing sports offers you. More and more wheelchair users are playing sports every day --some even on a professional level. The following are just a few examples of the different choices you have. Wheelchair basketball is a very common wheelchair sport. It was started over forty years ago as part of a medical recovery program. Over the years it has grown rapidly. Today wheelchair basketball is a professional sport that has more than 180 teams across the United States. In order to play wheelchair basketball, it is essential to have a lightweight wheelchair. Several different kinds of sports wheelchairs are on the market today just for sports fans. Another wheelchair sport, quad rugby , was specifically designed for people who can't move their arms or legs and are unable to play wheelchair basketball. It is a mixture of wheelchair basketball and ice hockey. To play the game you must have two teams of four players each. Power soccer is another fun wheelchair sport that can be very fun and exciting. Players in power soccer must have an electric wheelchair. Two teams have two 30-minute halves to push the soccer ball over the other team's goal line. The first team to reach the other team's goal line most frequently wins. Based on the sport you choose to take part in, there are several things you can buy for your wheelchair, including belts, gloves, bags for carrying things, drink holders and special back supports.

From Fannie Mae's survey report, we can know that _ .	Cities with high levels of homeownership--in the range of 75%, like Detroit and St. Lous -had on average considerably lower levels of economic activity and much lower wages and incomes. Far too many people in financial problems are trapped in homes they can't sell, unable to move on to new centers of opportunity. The cities and regions with the lowest levels of homeownership--in the range of 55% to 60% like Los Angeles and New York--had healthier economies and higher incomes. They also had higher levels of happiness and well-being. I was shocked to read these interesting points that Richard Florida made in his recent article. Let me try to understand. The people in Detroit and St. Louis are less happy than the people in New York, and Los Angeles. And, the reason is because of home ownership rates? First, to compare them to New York City (the economic capital of the world), Los Angeles (the entertainment capital of the world) seems unfair. Most people in almost any other city in the world might be less happy! Next, let's try a different way of determining whether renters are happier than homeowners. Why don't we ask them? Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey 2010 reported: 75% of current renters believe owning a home makes more sense. 67% plan to buy a home at some point in the future. When they asked current renters for the major reason to buy a house, these were their answers (they could pick several answers): 78% said it was a good place to raise children. 75% said because they would feel safe. 70% said because you have control your own space. If you believe renters are happier, you would also have to believe the majority enjoy living in a less safe environment, which wouldn't be a good place to raise children and would be a place where they have less control of their space. ks5u	['most renters prefer to become homeowners']
Why can't we eat a mint and drink cola at the same time?	Coca-Cola is probably the most famous brand in the world, and in some areasyou can even access it easier than clean drinkable water. Although the company is trying to present itself as a health-conscious company, you can't really say that drinking cola is healthy for you. Still, we all drink cola, some more and some less, and we tell ourselves that it's all okay as long as we don't overdo it. However, Coca-Cola has other functions besides drinking. Cola removes the tarnish from old pennies. Got some old rusty pennies? Not to worry! Put them inside a glass of cola and let them rest for a while. When you get them out, you'll have shiny pennies that will look as if they were coined a couple of days ago. If you couldn't clean those pennies with industrial acids, just buy a can of cola and let it do its magic! You can remove gum from your hair with cola. If you've got gum stuck in your hair and don't know a better way to get it out, don't worry, you won't have to cut it. Just pour some cola into a bowl and dip the part of your hair with gum on it inside. Leave it for a couple of minutes and then simply wipe off the gum. You can make an exploding fountain. You probably know about this one. You can make an exploding fountain by putting a mint inside a two-liter bottle. Then move away from the bottle and get ready for a Coca-Cola explosion. This is a fun thing to do, but it is also a warning -- don't eat a mint and drink cola at the same time, because a similar thing could happen to your stomach.	['It can cause harm to our stomach.']

What is the text mainly about?	Solar water heaters can use energy from the sun to heat water. They are used around the world. The solar water heater is based on a design developed some years ago in Afghanistan. Since then, it has been built and used in many countries. It can heat seventy liters of water to 60degC. It can do this between sunrise and noon on a clear day with an average temperature of 32degC. There are two parts of the solar water heater. One part, the collector, is made of a metal plate painted black. This metal surface, placed in contact with the water, will heat the water. Black-painted surfaces that receive the sun's heat become hotter than those of any other color1. Metal plates that have raised parts on the surface work better than those without them. Once the water is heated, it is kept hot with special material, which allows the water to stay warm for a long time. The second part of the solar water heater holds the water for the system. This water tank can hold about one hundred liters of water. Two rubber pipes are connected to the water tank. One pipe lets water go into the system. The other lets water go out. When the water heater is working correctly, water will flow from the tank to the collector and back again. You can use the hot water at the top of the tank for washing and cleaning. This solar water heater is easy to build and operate. It will last about two years before the rubber pipes need to be replaced.	['Knowledge of solar water heaters.']
Up to a point, their success is due to _ .	"A high school in Hiroshima City has been the first to do something with DNA in the world.

The school is one of the Super Science High Schools allowed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, where students are given an opportunity to study science at an advanced level. Here, students use the same type of hitech experimental laboratories as those found at universities. In these labs, they conduct experiments and research in new fields of study not found in textbooks. As part of this science course, the students, with the help of Hiroshima University, used a machine called sequencer , and over the course of a year and a half they succeeded in decoding the DNA. They then presented their results to academic groups. Achieving a world first might sound very wonderful, but the process of decoding the DNA involved very hard work. The students were also responsible for maintaining the equipment, and they had to read difficult research papers and put in extra study beyond their regular schoolwork. ""Researchers need to work hard. The work was tiring, but the students worked toward their ambitious goal of achieving a world first.

"The sentence ""it's out of the question"" means "" _ ""."	We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer.

As a matter of fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it might be advisable to stay home this summer and not go any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I could offer to work instead of taking two weeks off; then maybe my boss would suggest that I be given four weeks' vacation next summer instead of two weeks.

Which of the following is right ?	"When we buy a house, we all want to have nice neighbours, because most of us think that it is helpful to live with some good neighbours. But what kind of neighbour is good? The answers are different from people to people. Here are my answers. First, it is very important to respect each other. If our neighbours try to know more about our life, what will we feel? He or she may also talk with others about our life. Do you want to live with him or her any more? The answer is ""No"". We will feel very sad to have this kind of neighbour and move away quickly. Next, a good neighbour is always ready to give us a hand when we need him or her. For example, if we are not at home, our good neighbours will watch our house for us. Finally, a good neighbour should love the environment . He or she never puts rubbish here and there. Good neighbours should keep the place clean, because the good environment can make us comfortable and happy. I think we all should learn to be good neighbours, and I also hope everyone will have good neighbours and live a happy life."	['People should learn to be good neighbours .']
Beilock's attitude towards Overdeck's idea is _ .	"A lot of people say math is not their strong suit. One New Jersey parent wants to help change that. Laura Overdeck grew up with numbers. She always helped measure ingredients when her mother baked, and she learned about angles from her father. She went on to major in astrophysics in college. Overdeck knew she wanted her own children to be good at math, too. ""And when our first child was about two, we just started giving her a math problem every night,"" Overdeck said. The problem was usually a story, involving animals, cars or candies that let the kid count. ""Our third child started, at age two, yelling that he wanted his own math problem because he saw his brother and sister doing it. And we thought, 'Wow, we have a household where math is the popular thing at bedtime,'"" Overdeck said. In February, Overdeck launched Bedtime Math, an Internet website where she posts daily puzzles for children. Overdeck is particularly keen to hook children on numbers before they go to school. So why introduce little ones to math so early? Sain Beilock, an expert on performance anxiety, says the more fun and familiar math is early on, the less likely children will feel nervous when they start to learn math in school. ""My lab has shown recently that kids as early as first grade report feeling anxious about doing math,"" Beilock said. ""You can hear totally educated adults say, 'You know I'm just not that good at math.' or 'I'm kind of afraid of math.'

What are the statues like?	The well - known Rushmore National Monument in the United States is built on the Rush More Peak, 1829 meters above sea level, of the Black Hills in the southwest of South Dakota. It is a group of huge stone statues of four American presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. President Washington is the founding father of the country;the 3rd President Jefferson drafted the U. S. Declaration of Independence;the 16th President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and the26th President Roosevelt protected the average people's right to compete fairly with trusts. All of them,made outstanding achievements for their country. They were pioneers of U. S. history. The stone statues of presidents were built at the suggestion of an historian in the State of Dakota,with a view to carrying forward the U. S. pioneering spirit everlastingly. The statues are 18 meters high. They are the highest and greatest realistic stone statues in the world,taller than a 6-storied building and larger than the Great Sphinx of Egypt. The size of each head is 20sq mt,with a 20-meter- long face,a 7-meter -long nose,a 2.6-meter- wide mouth and two 1.5-meter -wide eyes. Though not facing the same direction,they are all lifelike and look ahead gravely in harmony with fixed gazes. On clear days,one can have a sight of the four presidents with their firm and steady expression at a distance of dozens of kilometers. Since the stone sculpture is unique in style,the Monument is now the U. S. National Art Centre of Popular Education. Groups of people keep streaming everyday to the site for a visit and tourists across the world are also interested in taking a view of this great Monument.

What Michelle Obama said suggests that while watching cartoons _ .	"You might notice something new in the next few years as you watch Disney programs: Starting in 2015, there won't be any candy, sugary cereal or fast-food commercials aimed at kids. The Walt Disney Company has become the first major media company to ban ads for junk food on its TV channels, radio stations and websites. It hopes this will stop kids from making poor food choices. First Lady Michelle Obama called it a ""game changer"" that is sure to send a message to the rest of the children's entertainment industry. ""Just a few years ago, if you had told me or any other mom or dad in America that our kids wouldn't see a single ad for junk food while they watched their favorite cartoons on a major TV network, we wouldn't have believed you,"" said the First Lady, who heads a campaign to help stop child obesity. The ban would apply to Disney-owned ABC stations as well as Radio Disney and Disney-owned websites aimed at families with young children. In addition, Disney plans to make changes to its kids' menus at theme parks and resorts . Fast-food options will be replaced with healthier choices, such as smoothies , apples, vegetables and yogurt. In addition to candy bars and fast-food meals, other foods that don't meet Disney's nutritional standards will be banned from the company's kid-targeted media. Any cereal with 10 grams or more of sugar per serving will be _ . There will be no ads for full meals of more than 600 calories. Juices with high levels of sugar and foods with too much salt will also be pulled. Leslie Goodman, Disney's senior vice-president of Corporate Citizenship, said a company that wants to advertise will need to show that it offers a range of healthy options. Disney isn't the only one pushing away unhealthy foods. Last week, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg suggested a ban on drinks over 16 ounces sold in movie theaters, restaurants and convenience stores in the Big Apple. He says large, sugary drinks are partly to blame for obesity."	['kids would see a lot of fast-food commercials on TV']

What does the coin in vasilopita signify for its receiver in the New Year?	Food serves as a form of communication in two fundamental ways. Sharing bread or other foods is a common human tradition that can promote unity and trust. Food can also have a specific meaning, and play a significant role in a family or culture's celebrations or traditions. The foods we eat--and when and how we eat them--are often unique to a particular culture or may even differ between rural and urban areas within one country. Sharing bread, whether during a special occasion or at the family dinner table, is a common symbol of togetherness. Many cultures also celebrate birthdays and marriages with cakes that are cut and shared among the guests. Early forms of cake were simply a kind of bread, so this tradition hits its roots in the custom of sharing bread. Food also plays an important role in many New Year celebrations. In the southern United States, pieces of corn bread represent blocks of gold for prosperity in the New Year. In Greece, people share a special cake called vasilopita. A coin is put into the cake, which signifies success in the New Year for the person who receives it. Many cultures have ceremonies to celebrate the birth of a child, and food can play a significant role. In China, when a baby is one month old, families name and welcome their child in a celebration that includes giving red-colored eggs to guests. In many cultures, round foods such as grapes, bread, and moon cakes are eaten at welcome celebrations to represent family unity. Nutrition is necessary for life, so it is not surprising that food is such an important part of different cultures around the world.	['Success.']
The author's attitude towards young people not giving up seats to the old is _ .	Nowadays, the younger generations are often complained about the selfishness and lack of respect by the older generations. It is undeniable that some young people do need to be educated on mutual respect and concern for others, especially senior members of society. But we older people should have some understanding about the young, too. Today's society is rather different from what it was when we were young. The social, financial and psychological pressure today's young people have to face is much higher than what we did back in the 1950s through the 1990s. They are in the early stage of their career. They have to find proper jobs to support themselves and work hard to rise. They have to live in smaller houses, because they are unable to afford the rising housing prices. Considering these facts, we may find it understandable why young people sometimes appear aloof and disrespectful. I don't mean that we should put up with it without reminding them of the need to mend their ways. What I mean is that we should be more patient, understanding and tolerant toward them. For instance, when we get up on a bus or a subway train, we should not complain about not being offered a seat. A young person does not offer a senior citizen his/her seat probably because he/she has to travel a long way to work or because the carriage is too crowded for one to move at all. In fact, young people do offer their seats to the seniors. I seldom take a bus or a subway train, but more than a quarter of the times I have done so, I was offered a seat. That is fair enough, considering that I do not look so old. But on occasions, I have seen old people not showing any sign of gratitude when offered a seat. China has become an aging society since the end of the last century. According to a recent survey, people older than 60 accounted for 11.4 percent of the nation's population. And the percentage is expected to rise because of the one-child family planning policy our country has practiced for more than three decades. In other words, the younger generations will have to shoulder a heavier burden in looking after the parents and grandparents. Theoretically, there will come a day when one couple may have to support four parents and eight grandparents. What a burden it would be! All this require that we should show more concern and understanding to our younger generations.	['understandable']
Which is the best title of the passage?	"Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes in reducing population growth--but more by accident than design.While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates,Brazil has had better result without really trying,says George Martine at Harvard. Brazil's population growth rate has dropped from 2.99% a year between 1951 and 1960 to 1.93% a year between 1981 and 1990,and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average.Martine says this figure may have fallen still further since 1990,an achievement that makes it the envy of many other Third World countries. Martine _ ,among other things,soap operas and installment plans introduced in the 1970s.Both played an important,although indirect,role in lowering the birth rate.Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas.Globo,Brazil's most popular television network,shows three hours of soaps six nights a week,while three others show at least one hour a night.Most soaps are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. ""Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction ,they describe middle and upper class values--not many children,different attitudes towards sex,women working,""says Martine.""They sent this message to all parts of Brazil and made people realise other patterns of family life and other values,which were put into a very attractive package."" Meanwhile,the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers.""This led to change in consumption patterns and consumption did not get along well with unlimited reproduction,""says Martine."

Fagin must be _ .	"The success of Pickwick Papers made Dickens very popular. He suddenly found himself at twenty-four the most famous novelist of his day. Busy as his social life was, he worked on two novels at the same time-Oliver Twist and Pickwick Papers. He was particularly proud of Pickwick Papers, which was a huge success and was regarded as a comic masterpiece . ""If I were to live a hundred years and write novels in each, I should never be so proud of any of them as I am proud of Pickwick Papers,"" he said. It has been said of Dickens that he grasped the imagination of' his readers because his imagination grasped himself. The people in his works were so real that they could make him laugh or cry. When writing Oliver Twist he said that he could not rest until Fagin, the wrongdoer , had been hanged. Dickens' marriage to Catherine Hagarth, with whom he had nine children, ended unhappily in 1858. He started to travel about giving readings of his works. His interest in theater gave his novels the qualities that made them suitable for reading aloud on the stage. A tiring trip to the United States affected his health. On June 9th, 1870, when he was working on a new novel, he died. Dickens had always wanted to die of working."	['a character in Oliver Twist']
Mrs. Jones was very happy when told about her room because she _ .	"The 92-year-old, thin, calm and proud lady, who is fully dressed each morning by eight o'clock, even though she is nearly blind, moved to a nursing home today. Her husband of 70 years recently passed away, making the move necessary. After many hours of waiting patiently in the hall of the nursing home, she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready. As she walked slowly to the elevator, I provided a true description of her tiny room, including the old sheets that had been hung on her window. ""I love it,"" she said with the happiness of an eight-year-old girl having just been presented with a new puppy. ""Mrs. Jones, you haven't seen the room...just wait."" ""That doesn't matter,"" she replied. ""Happiness is something you decide ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not doesn't depend on how the furniture is arranged. It's how I arranged my mind. I have already decided to love it. It's a decision I make every morning when I wake up. Each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open I'll focus on the new day and all the happy memories I've stored away."" She went on to explain, ""Old age is like a bank account. You take what you've put in. So, my advice to you would be to put in a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories. Thank you for your part in filling my memory bank."" And with a smile, she said, ""All my memories are happy ones."" Mrs. Jones was always happy in the nursing home and she died at the age of 108."	['had already made up her mind to be happy']
Which of the following colours belong to cool colours?	In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.	['Blue, violet.']
Susan failed to renew her license the first time in Maryland because _ .

I argued,pointing to a very large belly of mine,""I am married.I am having a baby.Why should I have to have someone sign for me to drive?""He answered coldly.""It's the law,madam."" Henry encouraged me to calm down,just go ahead and get the license and be done with it.""No,""I said.I refused to have him sign for me.So I left without a Maryland license. I called the North Carolina Motor Vehicle office and renewed my NC license by mail--using my name Susan Brown.And thus it was for the next twelve years.Since Henry was in the army I could drive under my home state license.By the time Henry left the army we were once again living in Maryland,and I had to take the Maryland driver's exam.Since then I just go in and renew every four years--sign the name Susan Brown,have my new picture taken, and walk out with a license to drive."

Why does relaxation play an important part in your good communication?	"Knowing how to communicate well needs very personal attention between you and another human being. Is there a better way to learn how to communicate effectively? Yes, there is. Please follow the 3 basic steps below. 1. Relax and Breathe. Whether it's a business meeting or the first date, the first thing you must do in order to communicate is to relax. When you relax you are in control. You control your reactions and your reactions do not control you. Breathing is central to relaxation. Take a few deep breaths and your body will begin to be more at ease. This will help you apply what you already know about how to communicate well. 2. Think and you will be prepared. Have you ever heard the old saying, ""think before you speak""? Well, it is true. By thinking ahead about how the conversation might flow, you will be better prepared, more at ease and more confident. 3. Follow the flow of the conversation. If you are uncomfortable, being silent will only make it worse and make the other person uncomfortable as well. So when all else fails, follow through with small talk until a common topic appears. A good way to keep a conversation going is to ask the other person questions. People love to talk about themselves and if you do this they will think very highly of you. . If you make an effort, you will succeed."	['Because it can help you put your communication skills that you know into use.']
"What do ""Feathered Friends"" probably refer to?"	"Students across the country are finding ways, with the help of devoted teachers, to raise funds for causes near and dear to their hearts.

Why did the office manager leave after directing Lillian to type a letter?	"Lillian was a young girl who grew up in a village. At the age of 16, her father forced her to drop out of school and find a job to help the family. With limited education, skills and hope, she would take the bus into the big cities of Windsor and Detroit, walk aimlessly about and then return home every day. She couldn't even bring herself to knock on a door. As the days passed, Lillian knew she would soon have to knock on a door. On one of her trips, Lillian saw a sign at Carhartt Overall Company, saying, ""Help Wanted, Secretarial. Apply Within.""

It can be inferred from the passage that	"In some urban centers, workaholism is so common that people do not consider it unusual. They accept the lifestyle as normal. Government workers in Washington D. C, for example, frequently work sixty to seventy hours a week. They don't do this because they have to; they do it because they want to. Workaholicm can be a serious problem. Because true workaholics would rather work than do anything else, they probably don't know how to relax. Is workaholism always dangerous? Perhaps not. There are, certainly, people who work well under stress. Some studies show that many workaholics have great energy and interest in life. Their work is so pleasurable that they are actually very happy. For most workaholics, work and entertainment keep them busy and creative. Why do workaholics enjoy their jobs so much? There are several advantages to work. Of course, it provides people with paychecks, and this is important. But it offers more than financial security. It provides people with self confidence; they have a feeling of satisfaction when they're finishing a challenging piece of work and are able to say, ""I made that."" Psychologists claim that work gives people an identity through participation in work, they get a sense of self and individualism. In addition, most jobs provide people with a socially acceptable way to meet others. Perhaps some people are compulsive about their work, but their addiction seems to be a safe--even an advantageous-one."

Which of the following snacks is unhealthy according to the text?	"You may have noticed that you feel hungry a lot. This is natural----during teens, a person's body needs more nutrients to grow. Snacks are a great way to satisfy that hunger and get all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs. But you need to pay attention to what you eat. Filling your stomach with a lot of fries after class may give you a short-time help, but a snack high in fat and calories will only slow you down in the long time. To keep energy levels going---and avoid gain weight---keep away from foods like candy or soda. Look for foods like bread and grains and combine them with some food like peanut butter or low-fat milk or cheese. Choosing healthy snacks means shopping smart. Be careful of the health instructions on food bags. Here are some things to watch out for. That something is ""all natural "" doesn't necessarily mean that it's nutrients. For example, ""all natural"" juice drinks or sodas can be filled with sugar (which means they'll be high in calories and give you little nutrition.) A granola bar is a good example of a snack that people think is healthy. Although granola bars can be a good source of certain vitamins and nutrients, may also contain a great deal of fat, including a particularly harmful type of fat called trans fat. Check the Nutrition Facts instructions on the bag to be sure."	['Candies and soda']

"Sir John Hawkwook's Italian name ""Giovanni Acuto"" was one which _ ."	"There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for ""protection"". If the money was not paid immediately, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop. Getting ""protection money"" is not a modern means. As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters. Then Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a group of soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to those who were willing to pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money with this method. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero .When he died at eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had his picture painted, which was in memory of ""this bravest man""."	"[""he earned through his sharp practice of selling his 'protection'""]"
We can infer from the passage that _ .	"We've all experienced a ""good cry"". Shedding some tears can often make us feel better and help us put things in perspective. But why is crying beneficial? And is there such a thing as a ""bad cry""? The researchers analyzed the detailed accounts of more than 3,000 recent crying experiences and found that the benefits of crying depend entirely on the what, where and when of a particular crying episode . The majority of persons reported improvements in their mood following a short period of crying. However, one third reported no improvement in mood and a tenth felt worse after crying. Criers who received social support during their crying episode were the most likely to report improvements in mood. Research to date has not always produced a clear picture of the benefits of crying, in part because the results often seem to depend on how crying is studied. The researchers note several challenges in accurately studying crying behavior in a laboratory setting. Volunteers who cry in a laboratory setting often do not describe their experiences as making them feel better. Rather, crying in a laboratory setting often results in the study participants feeling worse; this may be due to the stressful conditions of the study itself, such as being videotaped or watched by researchers. This may produce negative emotions, which neutralize the positive benefits usually connected with crying. However, these laboratory studies have provided interesting findings about the physical effects of crying. Criers do show calming effects such as slower breathing, but they also experience a lot of unpleasant stress, including increased heart rate and sweating. What is interesting is that bodily calming usually lasts longer than the unpleasant. The calming effects may occur later and overcome the stress reaction, which would account for why people tend to remember mostly the pleasant side of crying. Research has shown that the effects of crying also depend on who is shedding the tears. For example, individuals with anxiety or mood disorders are least likely to experience the positive effects of crying. In addition, the researchers report that people who lack insight into their emotional lives actually feel worse after crying."	['a good cry can sometimes help us face problems rightly']
Why did families buy Katie's lamb and return it repeatedly?	"Jayne Fisher watched anxiously as her 17-year-old daughter Katie pulled her lamb into the Madison County Junior Livestock for sale.

This was her first chance in months to be outdoors having fun, away from hospitals and treatments, and she had come with high hopes for earning some money for her treatment. She had _ a little on her decision to part with the lamb, but with lamb averaging two dollars a pound, Katie was looking forward to it. So the bidding(began. That's when Roger Wilson, the auctioneer , had a sudden inspiration that brought some unexpected results. ""We sort of let everybody here know that Katie had a situation that wasn't too pleasant,"" is how he tells it. He hoped that his introduction would push the bidding up, at least a little bit. Well, the lamb sold for $11.50 a pound, but things didn't stop there. The buyer paid up, then decided to give the lamb back so that it could be sold again. That started a chain reaction, with families buying the animal and giving it back, over and over again. When local businesses started buying and returning, the earnings really began to pile up. The first sale is the only one Katie's mom remembers. After that, she was crying too hard as the crowd kept shouting, ""Resell! Resell! "" Katie's lamb was sold 36 times that day, and the last buyer gave it back for good. Katie ended up with more than $16,000 to pay her medical expenses----and she still got to keep her famous lamb."

In which order will the Presidential1 coins come out?	"Hundreds of people lined up at Grand Central Terminal yesterday, but they weren't there to catch a train. They came to New York City's famous railroad station to trade in old dollar bills for the new George Washington Presidential1 coin. The gold-colored coin is the first in a new series by the U.S. Mint that honors former U.S. Presidents. The Mint will issue four Presidential1 coins a year through 2016. Like the popular 50 State Quarters program, which issues coins in the order in which each state joined the Union, Presidential1 coins will come out in the order in which each President served. The George Washington coin is the first to be released. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison coins will come out later this year. The Presidential 1 coins will be the same size and color as the Sacagawea Golden Dollar. However, there is an important difference. For the first time since the 1930s, there is an inscription on the edge of each coin. Each coin will show a different President on its face, or head side. It will also show the President's name, the order in which he served and his years in office. The other side of the coin will show the Statue of Liberty and the inscriptions ""United States of America"" and "" 1"". There will be one Presidential1 coin for each President, except Grover Cleveland. He will have two! Cleveland is the only U.S. President to have served two nonconsecutive terms. The last President scheduled to get a coin is Gerald Ford because a President must have been dead for two years before he can be on a coin."	['Each President took office.']

She lives in a village of the Yinjiang Tujia and Miao Autonomous County at the foot of the Fanjing Mountains on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau . Twenty-two years ago, One day her parents were out, she fell into a fire stove at home, and the fire burned her fingers badly. The family was too poor at the time to afford the expensive medical treatment ,at last she lost all her fingers. ""When I was a child, I was unable to hold chopsticks. My parents taught me for a long time. It was really difficult, but I tried it over and over again ,and at the age of seven, I overcame it. From then on I knew that one had to put great efforts into what she was doing,"" said PengJiangya. As a child , PengJiangya often saw others make cross-stitch and then she decided to learn how to make it herself. "" Of course, it took me many years to do that, when I was 18, I got it."" Said Peng. Now she can make as good cross-stitch works as her companions ,but she is faster than other people. Her hometown of Yinjiang Tujia at the foot of the Fanjing Mountains on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateauhas become a tourist attraction. As for her future, Peng Jiangya said: ""I will gather a few other people to embroider the beautiful landscape of our hometown as a souvenir and lasting memory for tourists.

What is the author's attitude towards the future of preventing women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth?	"Pregnancy and childbirth kill more than 536,000 women a year. More than half of the cases happened in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. In fact, most of the deaths are preventable with basic medical care. The five leading causes are bleeding, infection, high blood pressure, longtime labor and bad abortions . Mothers' deaths from such causes were largely reduced nearly a century ago in developed countries. Experts say that what kill many women are ""the three delays""-- the woman's delay in deciding to go to the hospital, the time she loses traveling there and the hospital's delay in starting treatment. Only about 15 percent of births have dangerous complications . Women lack education and information about birth control. Husbands and inlaws, may decide where a woman gives birth and insist that she stay at home to save money. However, there is no single solution to a problem with so many factors--shortages of doctors, nurses, drugs, equipment, roads and transportation--though hospital officials are trying many things now. One _ measure to solve the problem for the present has been to train assistant medical officers, to perform certain operations. Some African countries are now struggling to train more assistants and midwives , and provide places for pregnant women to stay near hospitals. But there is a long way to go. Only 20 percent of women in the continent give birth at the hospital. More than 50 percent stay at home to give birth, and the rest go to local clinics that cannot handle emergencies."	['Objective.']
Why don't landfills make good neighbors?	Most of the things around you will be replaced or thrown away someday. Where will they go when they are thrown out? What kinds of waste will they create, and how will it affect the environment Most of our crash goes to places called landfills. A LANDFILL is a low area of land that is filled with garbage .Most modern landfills are lined with a cover of plastic to keep dangerous liquids from polluting earth and ground water supply. The problem is that more than half of the states in this country are running out of places to landfill their garbage. Because of the unhealthy materials, landfills do not make good neighbors,and people don't want to live near them. Many landfills are set in poor neighborhoods. The Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, New York, was the largest garbage landfill in the world. For years, people who live nearby complained about air and water pollution caused by the enormous pile of trash. They say that the smoke have made people sick. The landfill closed in April 2001.Now can a harmful waste--material that can pollute air, land, and water -be disposed of in a safe way. Another way to get rid of trash is to burn it. Trash is burned in an _ Because incinerators in operation can get rid of almost all of the trash, some communities would rather use incinerators than landfills. There is a problem, though. Leftover ash and smoke from burning trash may have dangerous chemicals, and even make it hard for some people to breathe. They can harm plants, animals, and people. You can help reduce waste by reusing bottles, batteries, and paper. You can also recycle newspaper, glass, and plastics t to provide materials for making other products. From recycled materials, many things are made. For example, from recycled paper we can get newspapers, boxes and so on. From recycled plastic we can get soda bottles, tables, and backpacks.

Steve Jobs is mentioned to prove that doing exercise _ .	"We get it: You're tired. You're busy. And your shoes are away over there. Excuses are OK sometimes, but not every day--and especially not today. So put on your sneakers, get up off the couch, and let us kick your excuses to the curb . ""I...dislike...panting !"" Being really out of breath may mean you're trying too much too soon, which will kill your confidence. But you don't have to be _ to get a workout. Being active doesn't have to mean high-intensity. It's just about moving. ""I hate exercise."" It may seem unbearable, but you just have to get started. Exercise releases endorphins (your brain's own feel-good chemicals), which can be habit-forming. What' s the best exercise? The one you'll do regularly. So you may hate running. Don't run! Ride your bike or just dance. Even cleaning your room is active. As long as you're moving and getting your blood pumping, it counts. So get creative. ""I don't have time."" You may not have lots of time to spare when you're busy with schoolwork, but we bet you can find 10 minutes. Bonus: An activity break will send oxygen to your brain, making you super-alert and more creative too. Famous thinkers like Aristotle and Steve Jobs liked ""walking meetings,"" and you can follow in their footsteps by moving around while you brainstorm about a tough task or memorize your English vocabulary. ""I never see results!"" Even if you train with the help of a professional, you won't see results right away. But you will feel them almost immediately. Don't focus on how your body looks--focus on how you feel. Keep a journal of when you exercise (or don't) and how you feel that day: Stressed? Focused? Tired? When you start noticing the amazing effects of exercise, you'll have no excuses."	['makes one more productive']
This text can most likely be found in _ .	There are some strange driving laws in different countries. Vietnam: If you're in Vietnam without a Vietnamese driver's license, you risk a prison sentence of up to 3years. Russia: In Moscow, if your car is dirty enough to draw dust art, you will be fined about 2,000 rubles. Worse yet, it's not legal to wash your car by hand in public places--forcing you to take it to one of the few car wash facilities. Thailand: Drivers--males or females--can't drive shirtless, whether it's a car, a bus or a tuk-tuk. France: France requires its drivers to carry a potable breathalyzer all the time when driving a car. The one-time breathalyzer cost around US $ 5, and if you don't have one, you will be fined US $ 15. Cyprus: Raising your hands in the car can get you fined of US $ 35. The law states a driver can be fined if the person is not in a regular position inside the car or raises his hands from the steering wheel unnecessarily. Japan: Politeness isn't just the culture in Japan; it's part of driving laws. Splashing a person by driving through a puddle with your car will cost you over US $ 60. The country is also strict with its DUI laws---riding with or lending your car to a driver who gets caught drinking can lead to a fine costing thousands of dollars.

The writer suggests that _ .	"When should a child start learning to read and write? This is one of the questions I am most frequently asked. There is no hard and fast rule, for no two are alike, and it would be wrong to set a time when all should start being taught the intricacies of reading letters to form words. If a three-year-old wants to read(or even a two-year-old for that matter), the child has the right to be given every encouragement. The fact that he or she might later be ""bored"" when joining a class of non-readers at child school is the teacher's affair. It is up to the teacher to see that such a child is given more advanced reading material. Similarly, the child who still cannot read by the time he goes to junior school at the age of seven should be given every help by teachers and parents alike. They should make certain that he is not dyslexic(having difficulty in reading). Although parents should be careful not to force youngsters aged two to five to learn to read( if badly done it could put them off reading for life ), there is no harm in preparing them for simple recognition of letters by labeling various items in their rooms. For instance, tie a nice piece of cardboard to their bed with BED written in neat, big letters. Should the young child ask his parents to teach him to read, and if the parents are capable of doing so, such an attraction should not be ignored. But the task should never be made to look like a hard job and the child should never be forced to continue, or his interest should start to flag."

A snail _ .	We've talked about snails and their slow move. But much of the time snails don't move at all. They're in their shells ---sleeping . Hot sun will dry out a snail's body. So at the least sign of hot sun, a snail draws its body into its shell and closes the opening with a thin cover. Then it goes to sleep. A snail will die in a heavy rain. So whenever it rains, it goes inside its shell house and goes to sleep. A snail can sleep for as long as it needs to. It can take a short sleep. Or it can sleep for days at a time. And it spends all the winter months in its shell, asleep. In spring the snail wakes up. Its body, about three inches long, comes out of from the shell. When hungry, the snail looks for food. It can't see very well. Its eyes, at the ends of the top feelers are very weak. But its sense of smell is very strong. It helps the snail to the new greens. Then the snail's little mouth goes to work. A snail's mouth is no longer than the point of a pin . Yet it has 256,000 teeth! The teeth are so small that you can't see them. But they do their work.. If you put a snail in a hard paper box, it will eat its way out. And if a snail wears out its teeth, it will grow new ones. Mostly, a snail looks for food at night .But on cloudy days it eats in the daytime. It eats all day long. A snail can go on eating for hours and never feel full.	['sleeps much of the time']
A person with empathy is often _ .	"Empathy lets us feel another person's pain and drives us to help. Do any other animals feel empathy? Scientists recently found that rats do, too. Most people don't like rats. In many people's eyes, rats are only bad. But Jean Decety and his partners at the University of Chicago did an experiment. It showed that rats are kind, warm-hearted animals. They can feel each other's pain. Scientists placed pairs of rats in plastic cages for two weeks. During this time they got to know each other. Then they put one of the rats from each pair into a small container in the cages. The small container had a door. It was so designed as to fall to the side when the free rat touched it. Many of the trapped rats squeaked to show their discomfort. The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. ""The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,"" Decety said. ""Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior. But unlike those animals, rats can be ready used in laboratory studies. They will help us to learn which parts of the brain lead to empathy and helping behavior and whether empathy is natural."""	['kind-hearted']
"What does the writer mean by saying ""However,convenience call be a crutch""?"	"Facebook means never having to say goodbye. The social media web site has earned a reputation for reconnecting old friends. Last week,a guy whom I hadn't seen since my bachelor party five years ago sent me a friend request. I accepted and waited for ""Easy E"" to send me a greeting of some kind. He had sought me out,after all. I learned from his profile that he was in a relationship and had a son. However,I'm pretty sure we won't ever write wall--to--wall,let alone e--mail each other. But he'll remain a friend of online until one of us makes a point of removing the other from his official list. My pool of friends consists of family members,college buddies,co--workers from past and present,and friends of friends. There are 35 in all. If I spent some time uploading old e--mail addresses,I'm confident that I could increase my friend count actually. A person could make a mission out of reconnecting with childhood friends,former classmates,distant cousins, and those one would like to get to know better. And some people can even handle hundreds of on--screen relationships,keeping up with the daily happenings of their small army of companions. After all,there are worse fates than having too many friends. Thanks to e--mail,the inability to schedule face--to--face meetings no longer means a friendship must come to a close. But even with e--mail,people will lose touch if one or both parties stop writing back. That's normal. People move from school to school,job to job,city to city.

He's dying of cancer. In his final days, he tells you, ""I have 100,000 dollars in a bank back home. When I die, make sure my son goes to medical school."" Then he dies. But his son is a no-good playboy who has no interest in going to medical school and will waste that money away in a very short time. But your son is entering college, and he is willing to become a doctor. Which one do you give the money to for medical school? I've asked this question of everyone from the president of a famous university to an ordinary young soldier, and it has never failed to get a discussion going.

The passage mainly gives information about _ .	"Every culture has a recognized point when a child becomes an adult, when rules must be followed and tests passed. In China, although teenagers can get their ID cards at 16, many only see themselves as an adult when they are 18. In the US, where everyone drives, the main step to the freedom of adult life is learning to drive. At 16, American teens take their driving test. When they have their license, they drive into the grown-up world. ""Nobody wants to ride the cheese bus to school,"" said Eleanor Fulham, 17. She brought the pressure back to memory, especially from kids from wealthier families. ""It's like you're not cool if you don't have a car,"" she said. According to recent research, 41% of 16 to 19-year-olds in the US own cars, up from 23% in 1985. Although, most of these cars are bought by parents, some teens get part-time jobs to help pay. Not all families can afford cars for their children. In cities with subways and limited parking, some teenagers don't want them. But in rich suburban areas without subways, and where bicycles are more for fun than transportation, it is strange for a teenager not to have a car. But police say 16-year-olds have almost three times more accidents than 18 and 19-year-olds. This has made many parents pause before letting their kids drive. Julie Sussman, of Virginia, decided that her son Chad, 15, will wait until he is 17 to apply for his learner's permit. Chad said he has accepted his parents' decision, although it has caused some teasing from his friends. ""They say that I am unlucky,"" he said, ""But I'd rather be alive than driving, and I don't really trust my friends on the road, either."" In China, as more families get cars, more 18-year-olds learn to drive. Will this become a big step to becoming an adult?"	['an American culture']

In the author's opinion, many people like to gossip because it _ .	"""Did you hear what happened to Adam last Friday?"" Lindsey whispers to Tori. With her eyes shining, Tori brags, ""You bet I did. Sean told me two days ago."" What are Lindsey and Tori talking about? It just happens to be yours truly, Adam Freedman. I can tell you that what they are saying is (a) not nice and (b) not even true. Still, Lindsey and Tori aren't very different from most students here at Linton High School, including me. Many of our conversations are gossip . I have noticed three effects of gossip: it can hurt people, it can give gossipers a strange kind of satisfaction, and it can cause social pressures in a group. An important negative effect of gossip is that it can hurt the person being talked about. Usually, gossip spreads information about a topic--breakups, troubles at home, even dropping out--that a person would rather keep secret. The more embarrassing or shameful the secret is, the juicer the gossip it makes. Probably the worst type of gossip is the absolute lie. People often think of gossipers as harmless, bur cruel lies can cause pain. If we know that gossip can be harmful, then why do so many of us do it? The answer lies in another effect of gossip: the satisfaction it gives us. Sharing the latest rumor can make a person feel important because he or she knows something that others don't. Similarly, hearing the latest rumor can make a person feel like part of the ""in group"". In other words, gossip is satisfying because it gives people a sense of belonging or even superiority . Gossip can also have a third effect: it strengthens unwritten, unspoken rules about how people should act. Professor David Wilson explains that gossip is important in policing behaviors in a group. Translated into high school terms, this means that if everybody you hang around with is laughing at what John wore or what Jane said, then you can bet that wearing or saying something similar will get you the same kind of negative attention. The do's and don'ts conveyed through gossip will never show up in any student handbook. The effects of gossip vary depending on the situation. The next time you feel the urge to spread the latest news, think about why you want to gossip and what effects your ""juicy story"" might have."	['gives them a feeling of pleasure']
The author wrote this passage in order to _ .	"At one time it was the dream of many little girls to become a nurse. Today, however, America is facing its worst nurse shortage since World War I. Recently about 2, 000, 000 nurses are needed and 60 percent of all hospitals in the US have shortages large enough to threaten the quality of care provided. The demand for nurses spreads widely throughout the nursing field. What has become of these women in white? The answer lies in not one but several causes. One possibility is the fact that women have greater career options . In the past, women who chose to work outside the home had two basic choices: nursing or teaching. Today, more women than ever are in the work force, but their options have greatly increased. There are women doctors, lawyers, firefighters and police officers. In fact, women today are found in nearly every field of work. Nursing has been left behind, as women move on to jobs with higher pay and greater status . A woman or man in the nursing field is often looked down upon as ""merely a nurse"". Teachers may be also at fault. Many high school students are actually being persuaded to keep away from nursing, told by teachers that they are ""too bright to be a nurse"". Americans are living longer than ever and requiring more medical attention. In fact, the number of elderly patients has almost doubled in the past twenty years. Obviously a larger population requires more nurses. AIDS and other diseases have caused more and more people to need nursing care. Usually fatal diseases mean long drawn-out hospital stay, that is to say, more nurses are needed to care for these patients. It is said that the demand for nurses will be doubled in the coming ten years."	"[""draw people's attention to the nursing shortage problem""]"

The passage is mainly about _ .	Emotional eating is when people use food as a way to deal with feelings instead of to satisfy hunger. We've all been there, finishing a whole bag of chips out of boredom or eating cookie after cookie while _ for a big test. But when done a lot -- especially without realizing it -- emotional eating can affect weight, health, and overall well-being. Not many of us make the connection between eating and our feelings. But understanding what drives emotional eating can help people take steps to change it. One of the biggest myths about emotional eating is that it's prompted by negative feelings. Yes, people often turn to food when they're stressed out, lonely, sad, anxious, or bored. But emotional eating can be linked to positive feelings too, like the romance of sharing dessert on Valentine's Day or the celebration of a holiday feast. Sometimes emotional eating is tied to major life events, like a death or a divorce. More often, though, it's the countless little daily stresses that cause someone to seek comfort or distraction in food. Emotional eating patterns can be learned: A child who is given candy after a big achievement may grow up using candy as a reward for a job well done. A kid who is given cookies as a way to stop crying may learn to link cookies with comfort. We're all emotional eaters to some extent. But for some people, emotional eating can be a real problem, causing serious weight gain or cycles of binging and purging. The trouble with emotional eating (apart from the health issues) is that once the pleasure of eating is gone, the feelings that cause it remain. And you often may feel worse about eating the amount or type of food you did. That's why it helps to know the differences between physical hunger and emotional hunger. Next time you reach for a snack, check in and see which type of hunger is driving it.	['what emotional eating is and its harm']

Never say never"", said a rising 17-year-old singer, Justin Bieber, who was just an ordinary boy in Canada a few years ago. After the accident of falling from the 18th floor and lying in the snow for three hours, my hands were frozen and my spinal cord was seriously injured.

What was worse , I suffered a lot from depression ( ).On top of this , I suffered from insomnia , I couldn't fall asleep the whole night. Hopelessly , mom and I came back to my hometown, which is small town in Guangdong. At that time , I thought that I would never be able to walk again. I would never love and be loved. I would never be able to earn even a penny. I would never be able to repay the kindness I got from my parents and many nice people . Life was meaningless. Now two years has passed.My hands are 80% recovered.I can even type faster than a healthy person ! Up to now, I have worked for a company as an interpreter for half a year already.

The author felt he could not miss the offer because _ .	"The first time I went for a walk around my father-in-law's neighborhood was garbage day, and I was shocked to see what people were throwing out. It was back in 1981, and I saw many people gathered in someone's front yard. As I went nearer to see what was happening I got my first introduction to yard sales. For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight. The following weekend, at another yard sale, I saw a 14-inch color1 TV being sold for almost nothing. I felt I could not miss the offer and bought it. Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to s. So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business. Every few months I would gather several boxes of American ""junk"" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home. As word got out about my father's ""trash"" market, people all came to buy these things. Three years later, when I visited my family for the first time since leaving home, I learned that many of the families in our neighborhood had a piece of ""trash"". It proved that I had the responsibility to keep people back home up to date with the latest technology you no longer need.(304words)"	['the second TV set was very cheap']
What side of the author matters a lot to Super according to him?	We met in a crowded showroom fifteen years ago. As I inched forward I eyed him with suspicion, unsure what to make of this stranger.A salesman made the proper introductions and although we got to know each other, I didn't trust him. I call him Super. I would find myself staring at him, wondering what secrets he held. I found myself spending more and more time with Super, getting to know him, learning to trust him. My other friends soon became a little jealous, stating that I spent too much time with him. It was true, but I didn't feel guilty, for I could just be myself with him. He didn't care about my appearance, pay and failure. None of these things mattered to him. Then _ one _ day _ he _ said _ he _ was _ going _ to _ show _ me _ the _ world.He _ said _ that _ I _ could _ ask _ to _ go _ anywhere, _ anywhere _ at _ all. When I asked him to show me New York, he didn't hesitate. He showed me the bright lights of Broadway, the majestic Statue of Liberty and so much more. Late at night we played games. Sometimes I won, sometimes he did.It didn't matter because we had fun. Through him I met other people. Men and women I never would have met if it wasn't for him. Then suddenly he became sick. He was unable to do anything and I felt so helpless because I didn't know what was wrong. But I knew those who could.I paced around the room while he was examined.What if it was something serious? What if he died? I cried but luckily he was fine again. I looked at him and saw my companion, teacher, instructor, travel guide and so much more.He was my friend, my best friend.He is ... my computer.	['Nothing.']
This passage is mainly about _ .	Anger is a kind of feeling. Many things can make you angry. When your teacher gives you too much homework, when your team loses an important game, when a friend borrows your favorite thing and then breaks it, you may get really angry. Usually, your body will tell you when you are angry. For example, you breathe faster, your face turns red, and you may want to break something or hit someone, but sometimes, you hide your anger. For example, you may hide it in your heart. The problem is that if you do this, you may get a headache or your stomach may hurt. In fact, it's not good to hide your anger, and it's normal for you to get angry sometimes. But anger must be let out in the right way, without hurting others or yourself. When you get angry, you can talk about it with other people. It's helpful to talk about your anger with an adult, such as parents, a teacher, etc. When you talk about anger, those bad feelings can start to go away. Here are some other things you can do when you start to feel angry: talk to a good friend; count from 1 to 100; give someone a hug ; go for a bike ride; think about good things, etc. Remember that how you act when you are angry can make everything better or worse. Don't let your anger you.	['anger']
Children may be more rebellious if _ .	"Teens are more likely to behave badly if their parents expect them to,a new US study has found. ""Parents who believe they are simply being realistic might actually be having a bad effect on their children,"" Christy Buchanan,a teacher at Wake Forest University and one of the authors of the study,said. ""Bad expectations on the part of both parents and children predict more rebellious behaviors later on."" The finding came from a study of more than 250 sixth and seventhgraders and their mothers. They were examined at the start of the study and again one year later. If kids' mothers expected them to take more risks and be more rebellious,higher chances of risky behavior were seen. _ _ _ when kids had bad expectations of themselves. ""Sometimes parents expect more negative behavior from their children than they should based on the children's history of behavior,"" Buchanan said.Parents shouldn't be naive about the possibility of bad behavior,she said,but it's also a mistake to think that children who are wellbehaved will naturally become rebellious at the age of 13. ""By thinking risktaking or rebelliousness is normal for teenagers and showing that to their children,parents might add to other messages from society that make teenagers feel that they are strange if they are not willing to take risks or break laws,"" she said.""This can mean,for example,that when parents expect teens to drink before they turn 21 or to do other risky behaviors,kids are less likely to refuse to do so later in their lives."" On the other hand,parents' expectations that teens can exhibit good behaviors and refuse to behave badly or to take risks could help reduce the possibility of bad behavior,Buchanan said.""As a parent,you should put expectations on your children carefully."""

The benefits from anti aging creams are the following except that _ .	"One of today's hottest topics among women (and to an extent among men too now) is anti aging and how to reverse the signs of age.The beauty industry has responded to this by offering a wide collection of anti aging creams and other anti aging products aimed at all pocketbooks,ranging from economical to highly priced. And the question is ""do any of these often much-vaunted anti aging creams actually work?"" And if they do,how precisely do they perform their miracles? Well the appropriate response to that is that they do work - after a fashion.There certainly are anti aging creams available for a ly modest price that will reduce the appearance of wrinkles in a comparatively short period of regular application.But this really is the limit of their powers: they won't actually undo skin damage or eradicate all signs of age;they will simply modify them,some more effectively than others. The way they work is like so: they remove upper layers of dead skin cells and make deeper layers absorb water,serving to plump them up and make them look fuller and healthier.But since such anti aging creams only go skin deep,as it were,skin damage will reappear once you stop using the anti aging wrinkle cream. This means fairly heavy regular use,which might be costly depending on your choice of product.However,if you can afford it or think it's worth the cost,it won't be such an issue.After all,what woman wants to look older than her years when looking good is so tied up with many women's self-esteem and sense of identity. A compromise solution for those _ is to use the cheaper creams.In addition,it's always wise to be a little experimental to make sure you end up with the one that suits your skin best. So,to sum up: an anti wrinkle face cream will work within limits,depending on your objective."	['they make wrinkle faces rough']

What is the best title of this passage?	Are you going into skiing? Is winter your favorite time of year? If you like snow and ice, maybe you should stay at Ice Hotel in Quebec, Canada. But, you can only check in at this hotel during the winter. Why? Because this hotel is built every December. It has 32 rooms and 80 people can stay there each night. The hotel even has a movie theatre, art gallery, and church. Of course, all of these parts of the hotel are made of ice. In fact, all the furniture, art, lights, and even plates and drinking glasses are made out of ice. Because this hotel is so unusual, it is becoming very popular. People from all over the world come to the Ice Hotel to look at the fantastic ice art, drink and eat from designed ice dishes and experience the unique atmosphere. Some couples have even gotten married in the hotel's ice church. But all these guests keep their winter coats on!

Every guest gets a special cold weather sleeping bag and some fur blankets. These keep the room cozy until morning.	['What makes the Ice Hotel special']
Most people liked to buy books in the shop because _ .	"Mr. Green once worked in a big company. He was so busy that he couldn't do any reading.

The author wrote this passage in order to _ .	"Until recently, I hadn't done much community service.In face, I did nothing to benefit anyone but myself.My selfishness and laziness were clear before I received an assignment from my teacher.Each student was required to complete 10 hours community service.To me, 10 hours was a huge amount of time to spend helping others.Volunterring, for me, has been a truly life - changing experience. My mom suggested that I organize a food drive in our development and donate what I collected to a local shelter.Anything that would help finish the project seemed like a good idea, so I agreed.I made up flyers asking for donations and placed flyers at every house in my neighborhood. I was getting ready to fetch the cans from my neighbor's yards on the day of the food drive when all of a sudden it started to pour.Rain flooded the roads and wind blew hard, but I was determined to complete my task.My mom drove me around our development and I jumped out at every house to collect items people had put out. When we finally arrived the shelter, I was a little nervous because I had never been there before.The woman in charge was extremely grateful for the donations and said that the world would be ganizing the food drive and delighted that my service to the community would make a difference in people's lives. As I was leaving the shelter, a man asked if I was the one who had brought all the food.I shyly nodded, and he said, ""A round here, you are a hero."" From that point on, I made myself a promise that I would serve the community more often, even when it was not required.Through this school assignment, I have realized that caring for others is an important part of living and the world would be a completely different place if people all help those who are less fortunate."

How did the woman probably feel after reading the e-mail?	"A couple from Minneapolis decided to go to Florida for a long weekend to warm themselves up during one particularly icy cold winter. They planned to stay at the very same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years ago. They both had jobs, so it was decided that the husband would fly to Florida on a Thursday, and his wife would follow him the next day. Upon arriving as planned, the husband checked into the hotel. There he decided to open his laptop and send his wife an e-mail back in Minneapolis. However, he accidentally left off one letter in her address and sent the e-mail without noticing his error. In the same time: In Houston, a woman had just returned from her husband's funeral . He was a minister of many years who had been ""called home to glory"" following a heart attack. The woman checked her e-mail, expecting message from family and friends. Upon reading the first message, she fainted and fell to the floor.

Cars in the future mustn't bring _ pollution in the air.	Now cities are full of cars. Some families even have two or more cars. Parking is a great problem, and so is the traffic in and around the cities. Something will have to be done to change it. What will the cars of tomorrow be like? Little cars may some day take the place of today's big cars. If everyone drives little cars in the future, there will be less pollution in the air. There will also be more space for parking cars in cities, and the streets will be less crowded. Three little cars can fit in the space now needed for one car of the usual size. The little cars will cost much less to own and to drive. Driving will be safer, too. What is more, these little cars can go about 65 kilometers per hour. Little cars of the future will be fine for getting around a city, but they will not be useful for long trips. If big cars are still used along with the small ones, two sets of roads will be needed in the future. Some roads will be used for the big, fast cars, and other roads will be needed for the slower small ones.	['more']
What can we learn from the article?	"WASHINGTON -- President Obama brought together the leaders of Japan and South Korea to discuss cooperation on containing North Korea and its nuclear weapons programs. Japan and North Korea have had tense relations over unresolved issues, some of them dating back 100 years. The three leaders emphasized the importance of cooperation in dealing with North Korea. The meeting took place Tuesday in the Hague, after a twoday nuclear security summit. President Obama praised South Korean President Park Geunhye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for overcoming their differences to discuss a serious threat to regional peace. He emphasized the importance of cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue. Obama said the three discussed steps to deepen diplomatic and military cooperation, including joint military exercises and missile defense against Pyongyang. He said further discussions would take place next month, during his visits to Seoul and Tokyo. The South Korean president stressed the importance of a united response to North Korea, but also called on the North to choose a peaceful path. ""I sincerely hope that this meeting will offer a chance for us to reconfirm our trilateral coordination and strengthen the cooperation on the nuclear front,"" said Park. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed. ""Particularly it is extremely important that we were able to confirm close cooperation among Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea on the issue of North Korea, the three countries who would like to cooperate so that North Korea will be able to take a positive position with regard to nuclear and missile issue,"" said Abe. Japan and South Korea have several unresolved issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize again for crimes committed 70 years ago. Former U.S. diplomat Richard Armitage told an audience this week that painful historic injustices take a long time to heal, and that it is in Japan's interest to continue apologizing for as long as necessary. ""There is a historical record of enormous generosity, achievement and respect for human rights and human freedom,"" said Armitage."

From the text, we know water can carry _ .	"""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" Similarly, if we drink a little more water ever day, we may find that we need to go to the doctor a lot less often. A healthy diet is made up of water and a great many different kinds of foods. We know that healthy foods like fruits, vegetables and fish, are important as they provide us with energy and fibre, without giving us too much fat and sugar. But why is water important? The human body needs water to survive. Water is important as it carries poisons and waste out of our bodies. However, doctors advise us to drink plenty of water, much more than the small amount we need to stay alive. Some doctors believe that water is important for our health in all kinds of ways. They believe that a great many illnesses and health problems stars as a result of dehydration--a lack of water in the body. Most people are dehydrated at least some of time, although they probably don't know it. It is surprising to learn that if we feel thirsty, we are already in the first stages of dehydration. In fact, we are advised to drink water before we feel thirsty. These doctors think that health problems such as headaches, high blood pressure and asthma could be helped if people drink more water. They also believe that drinking more water can help people who are overweight. Water contains no calories so it will not make us put on weight. If we drink water, we will probably drink less sugary soft drinks such as Coca-cola. Doctors also believe that drinking more water may stop people from overeating. They say that many people think that they are hungry when they are, in fact, thirsty. Doctors suggest, therefore, that we eat less food and drink more water. There are still many health problems that cannot be solved by drinking water, so we should not stop going to seeing the doctor completely. However, if we make a decision to drink water every day, we may find that we need to go to the doctor a lot less often."	['poisons and waste out of our bodies']
The girl wanted to borrow a pen, because _ .	I found out one time that doing a favor for someone could get you into a lot of trouble. I was in the eighth grade at the time, and we were having a final test. During the test, the girl sitting next to me whispered something, but I didn't understand. So I leaned over her way and found out that she was trying to ask me if I had an extra pen. She showed me that hers was out of ink and would not write. I happened to have an extra one, so I took it out of my pocket and put it on her desk. Later, after the test papers had been turned in, the teacher asked me to stay in the room when all the other students were dismissed . As soon as we were alone she began to talk to me about what it meant to grow up; she talked about how important it was to stand on your own two feet and be responsible for your own acts. For a long time, she talked about honesty and emphasized the fact that when people do something dishonest, they are really cheating themselves. She made me promise that I would think seriously about all the things she had said, and then she told me I could leave. I walked out of the room wondering why she had chosen to talk to me about all those things. Later on, I found out that she thought I had cheated on the test. When she saw me lean over to talk to the girl next to me, it looked as if I was copying answers from the girl's test paper. I tried to explain about the pen, but all she could say was it seemed very very strange to her that I hadn't talked of anything about the pen the day she talked to me right after the test. Even if I tried to explain that I was just doing the girl a favor by letting her use my pen, I am sure she continued to believe that I had cheated on the test.

Which of the following can be the best title for this passage?	"Almost nothing we do in this world is done in isolation*. At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, ""True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens."" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people."	['How to be successful leaders']
When giving this speech, Severn Suzuki probably felt _ .	Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for E.C.O.--The Environmental Children's Organization. We are a group of twelve and thirteen-year-olds from Canada trying to make a difference. Vanessa Suttie, Morgan Geisler, Michelle Quigg and me. We raised all the money ourselves to come six thousand miles to tell you adults you must change your ways. Coming here today, I have no hidden agenda. I am fighting for my future. I am here to speak on behalf of the starving children around the world whose cries go unheard. I am here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go. I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the ozone . I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals are in it. I used to go fishing in Vancouver with my dad until just a few years ago we found the fish full of cancers. And now we hear about animals and plants going _ every day. In my life, I have dreamt of seeing the great herds of wild animals, jungles and rainforests full of birds and butterflies, but now I wonder if they will even exist for my children to see. Did you have to worry about these little things when you were my age? All this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions . I'm only a child and I don't have all the solutions, but I want you to realize, neither do you!	['worried']
What can we infer from the passage?	"All Ric O Barry wants is to stop the dolphinkilling, so he is headed to this seaside Japanese town, Taiji.The American activist, who is the star of a new awardwinning documentary that portrays the dolphinkilling here, got an unwelcome reception when he showed up here this week for the start of the annual hunt. His movie, The Cove , directed by National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos, was released in the United States a month ago but has not yet to come out in Japan. Scenes in the film, some of which were shot secretly, show fishermen banging on metal poles stuck in the water to create a wall of sound that scares the dolphins-- which have supersensitive sonar --and sends them fleeing into a cove. There, the fishermen sometimes pick a few to be sold for aquarium shows, for as much as $150,000. They kill the others, spearing the animals repeatedly until the water turns red. The meat from one dolphin is worth about 50,000 yen, and is sold at supermarkets across Japan. Greenpeace and other groups have tried to stop the hunt for years.Activists hope The Cove will bring the issue to more people internationally--and eventually in Japan. Already,the Australian town of Broome dropped its 28year sistercity relationship with Taiji last month,partly because of the movie. ""Some regions have a tradition of eating dolphin meat,"" said fisheries official Toshinori Uoya. ""Dolphinkilling may be negative for our international image, but it is not something orders can stop."" The town government in Taiji--which has made whales and dolphins its trademark--refused to comment about The Cove, or the growing international criticism against dolphinkilling. Many in Taiji take the dolphin hunt for granted as part of everyday life. They are _ about The Cove,seeing themselves as powerless victims of overseas pressure to end a simple and honest way of making a living."

It is the author' s view that _ .	"A is for always getting to work on time. B is for being extremely busy. C is for the conscientious way you do your job. You may be all these things at the office, and more. But when it comes to getting ahead, experts say, the ABCs of business should include a P, for politics, as in _ Dale Carnegie suggested as much more than 50 years ago: Hard work alone doesn't ensure career advancement. You have to be able to sell yourself and your ideas, both publicly and behind the scenes. Yet, despite the obvious rewards of engaging in office politics--a better job, a raise, praise--many people are still unable or unwilling--to _ ""People assume that office politics involves some manipulative behavior,"" says Deborah Comer, an assistant professor of management at Hofstra University, ""But politics derives from the word 'polite'. It can mean lobbying and forming associations. It can mean being kind and helpful, or even trying to please your superior, and then expecting something in return."" In fact, today, experts define office politics as proper behaviors used to pursue one's own self-interest in the workplace. In many cases, this involves some forms of socializing within the office environment--not just in large companies, but in small workplaces as well. ""The first thing people are usually judged on is their ability to perform well on a consistent basis,"" says Neil P.Lewis, a management psychologist. ""But if two or three candidates are up for a promotion, each of whom has reasonably similar ability, a manager is going to promote the person he or she likes best. It' s simple human nature."" Yet, psychologists say, many employees and employers have trouble with the concept of politics in the office. Some people, they say, have an idealistic vision of work and what it takes to succeed. Still others associate politics with flattery , fearful that, if they speak up for themselves, they may appear to be flattering their boss for favors. Experts suggest altering this negative picture by recognizing the need for some self-promotion."	['self-promotion does not necessarily mean flattery']
From the passage we may conclude that _ .	Paris is the capital of the European nation of France. It is also one of the most beautiful and most famous cities in the world. Paris is called the City of Light. It is also an international fashion center. What women are wearing in Paris will be worn by women all over the world. Paris is also a famous world center of education. For example, it is where the headquarters of UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Seine River divides the city into two parts. Thirty-two bridges cross this beautiful river. The oldest and perhaps most well-known is the Pont Neuf, which was built in the sixteenth century. The Sorbonne, a famous university, stands on the left bank of the river. There are many other famous places in Paris, such as the famous museum, the Louvre, as well as the Notre Dame. However, the most famous building in this city is Eiffel Tower. Paris is named after a group of people called the Parisii. They built a small village on an island in the middle of the Seine River about two thousand years ago. This island, called the lie de la Cite, is where Notre Dame lies.

Let's take the student life for example. There are some students who study too hard and play too little, while there are others who play too much and study too little. On the one hand, it is harmful to his health if he has too few physical exercises, and on the other hand, it is harmful to his mind if he plays too much. In the matter of eating, one also should be moderate. Do not eat too much or too little. Too much eating will make you sick, while too little eating will make you weak. The man of progress is he who neither has too high an opinion of himself nor thinks too poorly of himself. If he thinks too highly of himself, he is surely to become very proud, but if he has too poor an opinion of himself, he will have no courage to make an advance. Both the conditions above will make you lose your aim in life. A broadminded man is he who always moves within the orbit of reasonableness . In any activities in one's life, moderation is one of the best ways to enjoy real happiness.	['correctly arrange his time for study and play']
How many kinds of bears there in the zoo?	In our town, there is a big zoo with a lot of animals in it. There are some beautiful tigers and two old lions. They eat a lot of meat every day. There are also two big elephants and one baby elephant. The elephants are kind animals. They eat a lot every day. They like children. Children often give them bread and bananas. Elephants like bananas best. In our zoo there are also brown bears , black bears and white bears. They stand on their hind legs,hold up their fore legs and ask for food. They like cakes very much. There's also a children's corner in our zoo. Children ride horses and donkeys and watch the monkeys there. The monkeys are very funny. They climb up ropes and jump down again and play with each other(,) like small children. ,.	['Three.']
What do you think of the author in the passage?	The Christmas season is often considered the season of giving. Many of us spend a lot of effort and money in an attempt to give our friends and loved ones the best possible gift. But what is the best gift you could possibly give? Imagine that your bank gave you an account with $86,400 every morning of every day. You could use this amount of money for anything you want. But at the end of every day, the bank tells you that money in the account can only be used within that day. How would you choose to spend this money? This is the attitude we should take towards the time. Time can never get back. It is the only resource that no one can get more than another person. Around the holiday season, we find ourselves very busy. It is a point in the year where how you spend your time is crucial. Spending this valuable time to help another human being in need is one of the greatest gifts we can give. We never know when even giving a short amount of time to help or listen to a stranger, could make the rest of their day much more pleasant. However, the saying that money is time is one of the truest statements ever made. By the act of donating money to a non profit organization which helps -- for example, you are allowing that single mother to spend more time looking after her children, instead of being forced to spend time looking for a temporary second job. By donating some money, you have helped someone else use their time for a better cause. One organization I personally would encourage you to consider spending your time and/or money would be Eva Initiatives, an organization created for the homeless. I have volunteered there twice. It was a very positive experience, and being able to learn more about who lived there really gave me a perspective on the real struggles of the people around us.	['Warm-hearted.']
The author's course is welcomed by the prisoners because _ .	"I have been teaching animal behavior at the Boulder County Prison in Colorado for 10 years. The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own ""animal behavior"" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too. I get as much out of it as the students and it has made me a better teacher."	['they feel it easier to get along with animals']

Which of the following statements is the writer's opinion?	"If you live in a big city, there are many thing to drive you crazy on your daily route, and it's not just overcrowded subway trains. Vicky Zhao is a mainlander working in Hong Kong. For her, one thing she can't put up with is people standing on the wrong side of the escalator in subway stations. ""Escalators help us move faster and save time. It isn't a place to rest,"" the 24-year-old says. ""I often see tourists block the way with their suitcases or chatting on the escalators during rush hours. _ annoys me to no end."" Admitting she is not the patient type, Zhao says things are much better in Hong Kong than in cities on the mainland where ""stand right, walk left"" signs are often ignored. The logic behind the ""stand right, walk left"" escalator etiquette seems obvious. Even though you may want to catch your breath while you're transported up or down, you should still consider others and leave enough space for people in a hurry, so that they can run and catch the train. Many cities' escalators, including London's and Beijing's, use the ""stand right, walk left"" system to speed up the flow of people. (Australia is an exception and you should stand on the left side instead.) But some cities discourage people from moving on escalators out of safety reasons. In Hong Kong's subway stations there are regular announcements asking people to ""stand still"" on escalators. Even so, most people in thisfast-paced cityobserve the ""stand right, walk left"" etiquette. But the people who stand on escalators defend themselves by telling the walkers not to be so impatient. The BBC quotes one stander as saying: ""If the person is in such a rush, why not just take the stairs? Even when the escalator is packed and there's nowhere to move, I see these same people complaining about not being able to pass."" Whatever the escalator etiquette is in the place you live or visit, do what most people are doing and always be mindful of others: leave enough space between each other, don't stay at the end of the escalator, and if someone is blocking your way, a simple ""excuse me"" is enough."

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Ron Meyer is the president and COO of Universal Studios.As one of the most successful business leaders in Hollywood, he heads up Universal Pictures and Universal Parks & Resorts.He's the guy who oversees the production of Multimillion-dollar extravaganzas likeKing KongandCinderella Man. Meyer's story sounds like the plot of one of his motion pictures.He grew up in a modest home where there was little income.It was a big deal to go to a restaurant.At 15, he quit high school and spent his time hanging out with the neighborhood toughs .He was then a kid quick with his fists who seemed to get into fights somewhat regularly.At one point, he was separated from others with an infectious disease, having no TV and nothing to do.His mother sent him two books.One wasThe Amboy Dukes, a novel about kids in street gangs.The other wasThe Flesh Peddlers, about a guy in the talent agency who lived a successful life.""I realized,"" he says, ""that I was no longer that silly kid I had been, and I wanted to change my life."" Meyer took any job he could get.He worked as a busboy and short-order cook.He cleaned offices and sold shoes.That attitude made an impression on people.One day he received a call from Paul Kohner, a successful agent who represented stars like John Huston, Charles Bronson and Lana Turner.Their messenger and driver had quit, and they knew Ron was willing to take whatever job they offered. He started the job the next day. Meyer was lucky to work with a good boss--and _ .In nearly six years of driving for Kohner, Meyer became his right-hand man and learned a lot.By the 1970s, Meyer had built many relationships in the business.In 1975, the fate presented an opportunity and he started his own operation Creative Artists Agency, which became a huge success, representing Hollywood legends like Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. Twenty years later, Meyer was appointed to run Universal Studios, a position far beyond his youthful dream.But once he saw success was possible, he was driven to achieve it.Today, colleagues regularly owe his success--and theirs--to his humility and perseverance.It's a level of success that takes determination, personality and intelligence, whether it comes from a college education or from the street."

The sponsoring matter between Sun Li and Zhang Haiqing was probably first released _ .	"Sun Li has bumped into the headline of the press recently not because of her role of an actress but of a sponsor of a university student. The student named Zhang Haiqing, who studies in prefix = st1 /ShanghaiFisheriesUniversity, wrote a letter to a reporter named Qiu Zhaoju working in Chongqing Satellite TV , saying that Sun, who had sponsored him for two years, stopped the financial aid after his entry into university and insulted him with words like ""you are no better than a pet dog. "" In 2002, Sun decided to sponsor the student who had lived in a poverty-stricken area when she shot a TV series in YunnanProvince. According to Sun's spokeswomen Ms. Wang, the actress and her mother bought pens, notebooks, even a mobile phone and a camera besides tuitions for him. Qiu revealed the complaint in his blog, which has soon set off a heated debate over whether Sun should stop or continue her aid to Zhang. Most of netizens who responded to the news expressed strongly different views to-wards the issue. The issue has answered for an old Chinese saying that longtime sponsorship will lead to hatred, an article written by a reader named Yin Guo'an on people. com. cn. The saying tells us that longtime contacts will set off conflicts. If Sun had donated 5,000 yuan to Zhang once and for all, the student would have had heartfelt gratitude for her. Now, however Sun's two -year-old funding has induced his complaint. It could be seen, the article said, that Sun had planned to shoulder Zhang's tuition until his graduation from university, as showed the actress' responsible attitude. As a student being sponsored, Zhang should have some self-control so he could neither feel justified to ask for constant help nor return kindness with hatred, the article suggested. The reporter Qiu also voiced his own views on kindness. There is no real kind and enmity between Sun and Zhang, he said. Both parties have not done something wrong, the reporter believed, _ , which results in mis-understanding and such a result no one could expect at the very beginning. That is why he put the student's letter in his blog, the reporter explained. ""I want you to think of the questions: why will a kind action lead to a bad ending? How should we help an innocent student deal with the action? What sort of kind actions will get the best result?"""	['on the Internet']
Many experts in America agree that _ .	"American teenager Thomas Cheatham had planned to study Latin during his sophomore year at Hebron High School in Texas. But when he learned that the school district was going to offer a Mandarin class, he quickly changed his mind. ""I thought it (Mandarin) would be more beneficial than Latin,"" said Cheatham, who is now in his second year of studying the language. He speaks Mandarin to order food at Chinese restaurants and can read Face book posts from his Chinese-speaking friends. While it'a difficult language to master, the high school junior, who plans to study computer engineering, thinks it will be a valuable thing in his career. ""Chinese is a good language to know, especially with China becoming a growing power,"" he said. Many experts agree that proficiency in a language spoken by a billion people worldwide will give American students an edge in the global economy. ""People are looking at China as our next economic competitor, and interest in Mandarin is growing,'' said Marty Abbott, executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. ''We're seeing it in all parts of the country."" The number of students studying Mandarin in public schools nationwide in grades 7 through 12 grew from 20,000 in 2004-2005 to 60,000 three years later, according to the council's most recent survey. Abbott estimates that as many as 100,000 students are now studying Mandarin, in public and private schools, throughout the nation. She said the US government has considered Mandarin to be an ""important needs"" language and provides professional development programs for teachers. ""Our government wants to increase our language ability for national security and economic competitiveness,"" Abbott said. At the same time, the Chinese government is spreading knowledge of the Chinese language and culture through Confucius Institutes established in many states. The Confucius Institute at the University of Texas in Dallas, founded in 2007, opens Confucius Classrooms at 11 local public and private schools where more than 700 students are learning Mandarin."

The passage suggests that when we learn a language , _ .	"In most languages, a greeting is usually followed by ""small talk"". Small talk means the little things we talk about at start of a conversation. In English-speaking countries people often make small talk about the weather: ""Nice day, isn't it?"" But there is something special about small talk. It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable. People usually agree about the weather, so it is a safer topic for small talk. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk in English. The topics for small talk also depend on where the conversation is taking place. At football matches, people make small talk about the game they are watching: ""Great game, isn't it?"" At bus stops, people may comment about the transport system: ""The bus service is terrible, isn't it?"" Greetings and small talk are important parts of conversation in any language. The way people greet each other and the things they talk about, however, may be different from one language to another. This shows that there is much more to learn when we learn a language than just the vocabulary and the grammar of the language. We also have to learn the social behavior of the people who speak it."

He got quite a good job with a building company, and as he did not drink or smoke, he saved up quite a lot of money. His wife's parents were still in Ireland, and one day she got a telegram saying that her mother was ill, so Pat gave her some money and she went to Ireland to see her mother. After a week, Pat wanted to write a letter to her, but he could not read or write very well, so he went to his priest and asked him to do it for him.

In the author's opinion, German high school leavers _ .	"For high school leavers starting out in the working world, it is very important to learn particular skills and practice how to behave in an interview or how to find an internship . In some countries, schools have programs to help students onto the path to work. In the United States, however, such programs are still few and far behind. Research shows that if high schools provide career-related courses, students are likely to get higher earnings in later years. The students are more likely to stay in school, graduate and go on to higher education. In Germany, students as young as 13 and 14 are expected to do internships. German companies work with schools to make sure that young people get the education they need for future employment. But in America, education reform programs focus on how well students do in exams instead of bringing them into contact with the working world. Harvard Education school professor Robert Schwartz has criticized education reformers for trying to place all graduates directly on the four-year college track. Schwartz argued that this approach leaves the country's most vulnerable kids with no jobs and no skills. Schwartz believed that the best career programs encourage kids to go for higher education while also teach them valuable practical skills at high school. James Madison High School in New York, for example ,encourages students to choose classes on career-based courses. The school then helps them gain on-the-job experience in those fields while they're still at high school. However, even for teens whose schools encourage them to connect with work, the job market is _ . In the US, unemployment rates for 16-to-19-year-olds are above 20 percent for the third summer in a row. ""The risk is that if teenagers miss out on the summer job experience, they will become part of this generation of teens who had trouble in landing a job,"" said Michael, a researcher in the US."

Which of the following can be used to describe the author's father?	For Canadians, backpacking Europe is a special ceremony signifying a new life stage. Unlike package tours, backpacking is a struggle, full of discovery and chance connections. It is about focusing on something different from our own lives and losing ourselves in a new world, if only for a moment. Well, that's what backpacking Europe is supposed to do. That's what it used to do before modern communications, social media, and commercial hostelling . Older Canadians would not recognize the Europe that they backpacked in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Far from a rough adventure into foreign cultures, the European experience has been _ in part by today's technology. A few years ago, I took my then 60-year-old father on a backpacking trip across part of Europe and Turkey. As he is an experienced traveler and someone who possesses a strong sense of adventure, I decided that we'd travel on a budget, staying in hostel dorms. For him, backpacking through Europe in 1969 was about independence and struggle. But two things surprised him at the end of our journey. First was how technology-based backpacking had become: Young people were so directly connected to home that they were hardly away in any meaningful sense. Second, the lack of connections we made with locals. Instead of making us feel closer to a place, he found commercial hostelling actually made us more alienated . But there was some room for hope. While technology takes our attention away from the beauty and history before us, there were also ways in which it helped us to connect with our surroundings. Websites like Airbnb have made it easier to stay with enthusiastic locals. Couch Surfing helps organize meet-ups between locals and travelers. The online marketplace Dopios offers a chance to meet locals through enjoyable experiences like a personalized city tour. Backpacking can never be the way it was for our parents' generation. But doing a little study of history and culture before leaving, and bravely getting rid of any electronic devices while traveling, will help give young travelers a taste of the glory days.

Which of the following can not help people get more Vitamin D?	"Cancer researchers urged people on Wednesday to take more vitamin D to lower risk of cancer, saying studies showed a clear link. ""Our suggestion is for people to increase their intake, through diet or a vitamin supplement,"" Dr. Cedric Garland said in a telephone interview. Garland's research team reviewed 63 studies, including several large long-term ones, on the relationship between vitamin D and certain types of cancer worldwide between 1966 and 2004. ""There's nothing that has this ability to prevent cancer,"" he said, urging governments and public health officials to do more to fortify foods with vitamin D.Garland is part of a University of California at San Diego Moores Cancer Center team that published its findings this week online in the American Journal of Public Health. Vitamin D is found in milk, as well as in some fortified orange juice, yogurt and cheeses, usually at around 100 international units (IU) a serving. People might want to consider a vitamin supplement to raise their intake to 1000 IUs per day, Garland said, adding that it was well within the safety guidelines established by the National Academy of Sciences. The authors said that taking more vitamin D could be especially important for people living in northern areas, which receive less vitamin D from sunshine. African Americans, who don't produce as much of the vitamin because of their skin colour, could also benefit significantly from a higher intake, the authors said."	['Have more meat']
What common things can tourists learn about at the four interesting places in the passage?	"There is more to tourism in Britain than you might think. When you think of tourist sites in Britain, what do you think of? Big Ben and the Tower of London? Lock Ness? Shakespeare's birthplace at Strafford-upon-Avon?

What caused Valderzak to gain back his hearing according to Dr.Smullen?	"For Robert Valderzak of Washington D.C.,Tuesday's earthquake was a miracle .

The soldiers didn't say anything because_.	"Mr Parker was born in a small village. His father was so poor that he couldn't send him to school. The boy had to help his parents to do some farming and learned English and maths by himself when he was free. Later on he was made to leave his home village and hoped to find a job in a city. And as soon as war broke out, he joined the army . He couldn't forget his terrible past and fought with the enemies bravely . So he became a general when he was fifty. He was honest and friendly to his soldiers and often punished those who tried to pocket a portion of the soldiers' pay . And his soldiers liked him very much. Once Mr Parker heard from a soldier. In the letter the young man said the food in their military camp was very bad and he wished the general could go to find out the reasons. The old man went there at once without telling anybody. He went in the kitchen and examined everything carefully and found it was very dirty. Then he went in the soldiers' bedrooms and found there were a lot of fleas. He became angry and asked the soldiers, ""What do you think of your food, young men?"" The soldiers saw their officer standing by the general and said nothing. Only a new soldier said, ""Very bad, sir!"" ""What did you have for lunch today?"" asked Mr Parker. ""A fried chicken, some fish and pork, a cake, six eggs and I had three cups of wine ."" ""Really?"" Mr. Parker called out in surprise. ""It's the King's lunch, I think!"" ""So do I, General,"" said the young man. ""But it's my birthday today. I paid three hundred dollars for them all in the restaurant!"""	['the officer followed the general']
What the author's purpose in writing this passage?	"The phrase ""live, love and laugh"" was one my cousin Roger lived by every day of his life. Even in his sickness, he found the positive in what some would see as a negative situation. He enjoyed life. He loved to laugh and most importantly, he lived life to the absolute fullest. He loved to travel, learning new things about different people and their culture. Roger was born and raised in Alabama, and he then moved to Buffalo, New York where he lived for many, many years until he relocated to Atlanta, Georgia, his final resting place. Whether his travels were long visits or short visits, large cities or small towns, his favorite souvenir item was T-shirt. Everywhere he went he would buy a T-shirt to remind him of his travels. Every T-shirt he owned had a story behind it that he would share with others. As long as he was laughing, living and traveling, he was happy. He loved everybody he came in contact with and everybody loved him. The old saying, ""He never met a stranger"", definitely applied to Roger and his life. His last few years of life were in and out of the hospital at least 10~15 days a month, sometimes more. Two weeks before he passed away, I spoke with him on the phone, and even then he managed to tell jokes about life. I know he left this world happily; he refused to allow anything or anyone to hold him down, even his severe illnesses. He was definitely a model to look up when it comes to not allowing any situation to keep you from moving forward in life. I will forever miss his smile and his love for life. My cousin Roger knew the true meaning of the phrase ""live, love and laugh""."	['To encourage readers to be positive all the time.']

According to the passage, Stacey's final goal is _ .	"Stacey Hillman, who is 10 years old, was reading a magazine about police dogs needing bulletproof vests . She thought that someone should start raising money for the police dogs. After she got permission from Chief LaBrusciano, she went to the County Sheriff Don Eslinger. She got busy visiting all the police dogs and telling the departments about her new charity. She made ""collection boxes"" by using bottles and put a picture of her with a police dog on it. She put these bottles in vet's offices and pet stores. The Chief from her hometown police department helped make Stacey's idea an official charity -- Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. The more money she collected, the more popular she became, and the more people offered to donate and help her with her goal of giving every police dog effective protection. Stacey travels all around her state to raise money and tell people how important the police dogs are. She speaks at schools, and they donate to her charity, too. Since Stacey started her charity, she has bought bulletproof vests for the police dogs with all the 140 thousand dollars she has raised. But she has many more K-9 friends that still need to be protected and she promises to keep doing her charity until every police dog in the whole country has a bulletproof vest. Each vest costs $700, and every police dog should have one. There are not always tax dollars to provide K-9s with these vests, and very few departments have them. The police dogs save lives just like police officers do, and often the police dogs are the first to go in. Stacey depends on donations from everyone to provide the dogs with bulletproof vests."

She thought for a while and then said, ""Yes, I remember now, doctor. When I married, I was twenty-two years old, and my husband was thirty then. Now he is sixty, I know, and that is twice thirty.

The magazine didn't publish one of David Salinger's stories at first because _ .	"Jerome David Salinger was born in Manhattan on New Year s Day,1919.His father was a Jew.His mother was of Irish descent. Never much of a student attended the progressive McBurney School.But he left school after two years and in 1934was packed off to Valley Forge Military Academy.In 1937,after a couple of unenthusiastic weeks at New York University,he traveled with his father to Austraia and Poland,where father s plan for him was to learn the ham business.Deciding that wasn t for him.he returned to America and driturned to America and drifted through a term or so at Ursinus College.His most sustained exposure to higher education was an evening class he took at Columbia in 1939,and under Mr.Burnett s directions he managed to sell a stpry""The Young Folks""to Story magazine.He afterwards sold stories to Esquire,Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post.In 1941,after several rejections,Mr.Salinger finally cracked The New Yorker,with s story""Slight Rebellion Off Madison,""that was an earlu sketch of what became a scene in""The Catcher in the Rye<<>> . ""But the magazine then had second thoughts,apparently worried about seeming to encourage young people to run away from school and held the story for five years--a long time even for The New Yorker--before finally pubishing it in 1946,buried in the back of an issus. Meanwhile Mr.Salinger had been drafted and was stationef for a while in Tiverton,Devon,the setting of ""For Esme--with Love and Squalor,""probably the most deeply felt of the ""Nint Stories"".On June,6,1944,he landed at Utah Beach,and he later saw action during the Battle of the Bulge.In 1945 he was hospitalized for""battle breakdown""and after recovering he stayed on in Europe past the end of the war.He married a German woan doctor,very briefly."

So he sent resumes to many companies he liked on the Internet. But, most got no reply, he said, ""Maybe they were surprised about my primary school education."" By chance, one of his friends was looking for someone, who could work as an egg porter in the supermarket, for 0.5 Yuan a box. Facing lots of difficulties in getting a job, he said, ""I'll take this job. At least I can make some money for my petrol ."" Then every day, he drove his car, his 18th birthday gift, to work in the supermarket. He did that for three months. Later, he heard that a newspaper was looking for a network technician , so he asked for it. But they were also worried about his school education. He practiced his skill right in front of the computer, and showed the managers web pages he had designed. He started to work the next day, and became the director of network department in less than a year. And now, the 23-year-old man is a boss.

In Donne's poems he believes that death is _ .	Directions:Read the following three passages.Each passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D.Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage you have just read. Death is a serious theme worthy of great poets.For example, John Keats's 'When I Have Fears That I May Cease to Be' and John Donne's 'Death, Be Not Proud' both discuss death in reflective ways.However, the imagery in these poems shows that while Keats believes that death can only destroy, Donne believes that death can be overcome. Keats is afraid of death, because to him death means the loss of those things that make his life worth living: 'On the shore/ of the wide world I stand alone, and think/ Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink.' Earlier in the poem, Keats says that he hopes this 'Love' will be a 'high romance' with a 'fair creature.' He also says that he hopes the 'Fame' he seeks will be the result of the 'high piled books' produced by his 'crowded brain.' In other words, Keats's fear is that death is a 'nothingness' that will arrive before he can finish his life's work or find his true love. Donne has a different attitude toward death, and so the imagery in his poem is different, too.To Donne, death should 'be not proud,' because it is not 'mighty and dreadful.' Unlike Keats, Donne sees death as weak and merely a 'slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men.' He also says that death is like 'rest and sleep'.Donne believes that we will all wake from the sleep of death to everlasting life, just as we wake from our normal sleep to our everyday lives.In fact, Donne believes that it is death itself that will die: 'One short sleep past, we wake forever,/ And Death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.' Keats and Donne both know that death is a prat of life, and both poets use powerful imagery to talk about that difficult theme.The differences in this imagery show two very different attitudes toward the subject, one of which is much more positive than the other.Which poet to believe is up to the reader to decide. Not surprisingly, the readers' own experiences may play a part in the way they respond to these poets' approaches.Like the two poets and their beliefs, contemporary readers also may be divided on the subject.This may explain why Keats's and Donne's poetry remains fascinating years after their won deaths.

"What makes the scene so""impressive""?"	"The sun is setting on a summer night.At the entrance of a deep,dark cave,a few bats fly out.Within a few minutes,millions and millions of bats are pouring out of the cave. Sounds like a scary horror movie? Believe it or not,this scene takes place all summer long,at Bracken Cave in Texas,where 20 million bats come out to feed on insects every night.""It is magical,""says Jim Kennedy of Bat Conservation International in Texas.""It is one of the most impressive animal movements on the planet."" Every March or April,Mexican free-tailed bats migrate up to 1,600 kilometers from their winter home in Mexico to their American home in Texas,where they raise their young. Soon after they arrive,each mother gives birth to one baby.As many as 500,baby bats crowd into 30 cubic centimeters of space.and all those bodies create nice warm tem- peratures to keep them cozy and comfortable. If you have ever lost sight of your parents in a crowded playground,you may be won- dering how mother bats recorgnize their children.They use their sense of smell to tell which baby is theirs when it is time for the babies to have milk. When twenty million bats fly out of one cave opening,they make a column so thick that they show up on the radar at the nearby airport.It can take three hours for all of them to get out from the cave.""You can feel the breeze from their wings,and see the plats wa- ving,""says Kennedy.""The movement of all those wings makes a very relaxing soft sound.I've always thought it would make a great relaxation music to help you go to sleep. So much for bats being scary!"""	['The huge number of bats flying together.']
What can we learn from the passage?	Maybe you often have arguments with your parens about clothes , homework,friends and many other things. But what's going on when your parents fight with each other? Most teenagers feel sad or afraid when their parents fight. They might think their parents don't love each other any more and that their arguments will lead to a divorce . In fact, it is normal for parents to disagree and argue sometimes. They might disagree about important things like jobs and family decisions. They might even disagree about little things that don't seem important at all---like what's for dinner. Maybe sometimes parents feel so strongly about their differences that it may lead to arguments. However, these arguments are often over quickly. Parents may say sorry and _ ,and the family returns to normal. As a family member, you should find out what it really means when your parents fight. When your parents get angry with each other, they might say things they don't really mean.Most people may lose their cool, so if your parents are fighting, don't worry too much about it. Try to find a good way to solve it . If your parents' fighting really bothers you, you might find it hard to sleep or go to school. If this happens, try talking to your parents about their behavior. They may not even realize it until you tell them how their arguments has affected you. You can also tell other relatives, a teacher or a close friend. Just remember that no family is perfect and arguments are common in every family.	['Parents might fight over small things.']
What is David Prior's attitude towards current food system?	"In 1986,when Carlo Petrini first coined the term ""Slow Food,"" he organized locally in his native Italy to preserve the food and wine culture and protest fast food. Today, slow food has spread to 132 countries with over 85, 000 members, addressing worldwide issues like farmer equity and _ --the actions people take to respect the rights of all living things and all environments, to contribute to healthy and livable communities. Characterized by Slow Food International as ""good, clean, and fair food,"" slow food must enrich the eaters' life,have no negative impact on human or environmental health,and compensate fairly for food producers' work. The average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to its final destination, with producing of food traveling by plane from overseas and other items shipped across the country. However,cost for food travel and heavy processing are not the only problems in the food industry that the environment faces. Industrial agriculture also has unsustainable practices like inefficient water use and decreased biodiversity. Our ideas in feeding ourselves are exceptional, but at various points our technologies come into conflict with nature's ways of doing things. A great many of the health and environmental problems created by our food system owe to our attempts to oversimplify natures complexities, at both the growing and the eating ends of our food chain. ""Slowing"" food, by purchasing locally and sustainably, allows consumers to reduce the impact of ""food miles"" and develop a closer relationship with their food producers."" We need to change our food system,"" said David Prior, organizer of Slow Food Nation EatIn. ""Our current food system is sick and we need to support farmers and agriculture to ensure that everyone has the right to nutritious food."""	['Unsatisfied.']

In the writer's opinion, the best home is_.	"Dear Lan Lan, I'm now writing to you at Hartsop, a village in the Lake District, a place to have most beautiful scenery in English couple here to spend Christmas with them. This was planned for overseas students to know British way of life by living with British families. We came two days before Christmas and during our stay, we have had everything we expected. Christmas turkey, Christmas cake, Christmas puddings, Christmas parties and Christmas gifts under the Christmas tree. All are exciting and amusing, but above all these, we are deeply touched by the hospitality of the family, Roger and Anne Marie. Anne Marie was a nurse and all these days, she had been busy cooking meals, washing dishes and showing us around. Roger, who was a doctor, knows a lot about China and still wants to know more. He plays us Chinese music and it seems to me he does better in that than we do. In the evenings, we all sit around the fireplace with Tim, a lovely dog, by our side. Like long-time-no-see friends, we talk about all the things that have happened or we hope to happen in our lives. There is always so much to tell and to know. After three months away from home, we are again feeling how sweet a home can be. Roger and Anne Marie are not like most of the other people we have met who always make us feel we are foreigners in a foreign country. They show such kindness to us that they bring us a person-to-person feeling, instead of a British-to-Chinese feeling. They make us believe that though there are differences of languages and cultures, one may always expect to find in every corner of the world the feeling of love and being loved. How I wish Mum and Dad could meet them! How I wish you were here with me! How strange it is that the more I feel at home here, the more I miss my real home and all of you. We always talk about ""when we go back home next year..."" and soon we will turn this into ""when we go back home THIS year..."" for the New Year's Day is coming. Miss you. Love Cao Wen"	"[""one's own home""]"
According to the passage, it might be appropriate for you to tell a joke at a business or social gathering if _ .	"What is funny? The short answer is: Who knows? The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another. In general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it. Admittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations. The best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight. Jokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an ""in"" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa . Never joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way. When you are the subject of the joke, the laughter doesn't feel good no matter how hard you try to tell yourself they're not laughing at you. Because that's what it feels like. What do you say if you realize your joke upset someone? Apologize as briefly and as sincerely as you can, and hope that someone changes the subject. Try saying: ""I'm sorry. I should have known better"" or ""I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking."" What do you do if people don't get your joke or don't appear to find it as funny as you do? First, do not retell it, only louder this time, hoping the point of the joke will be seen. Second, don't try to push people to get it. People do not like people whose jokes they don't understand. They feel stupid and need to blame someone. If you want to leave with the goodwill of your listeners, say something to make them feel less foolish. You could say: ""I don't know why I tell jokes when I'm so poor at it."" The world needs laughter, and good humour is a success wherever it goes, so this caveat about joke-telling is not meant to dampen high spirits or to advocate dull conversation. If you're a gifted story-teller and you know people love your jokes, go for it. We need your kind. The rest of us will save our jokes for family and close friends."

There are ten times as many newspapers and magazines because _ .	BEIJING, June. 30(Xinhua)----There are ten times as many Chinese newspapers and magazines than there were 30 years ago. That's when the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy. Figures from the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP)show there were 186 newspapers and 930 magazines in China in 1978. Today, the country has 2,081 newspapers and 9,363 different magazines. In the meantime, official figures show China has some 600 publishing houses producing nearly 300,000 kinds of books. That's a dramatic increase from the 105 publishers of the past that produced only 10,000 different books. Rapid economic development and universal education since China adopted the reform has helped fuel the need for more information sources. Under the market economy, hundreds of publishing houses and newspapers have taken steps to restructure management systems into corporations listed on the stock market. The legal system overseeing the news and publishing industries in China has also changed over the last three decades. Since 1990 a law and five relevant regulations were adopted in 1990 to govern the sectors. Since it started in 1993, digital publishing has _ . Its industrial volume amounted to 20 billion yuan (2.93 billion U.S. dollars) in 2006. More than 500,000 kinds of digital books were produced last year alone in China, which is more than any other country in the world.	['economic and education have developed under the policy.']
Dreams _ .	Everybody dreams. But only some people remember their dreams. Our dreams often include all the senses--smells, sounds, sights, tastes and things we touch. Early in the twentieth century, two famous scientists developed their personal ideas about dreams. Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud believed people often dream about things they want but can't have. Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung worked closely with Freud for several years, but he believed dreams provide solutions to problems we face when we are awake. Other researchers are studying how dreaming helps our bodies work with problems and very sad emotions . Robert Stickgold is a professor of psychiatry . He says that when we dream, the brain is trying to make sense of the world. He does not agree with Sigmund Freud that dreaming is the way we express our hidden feelings and desires . Scientists believe it is important to keep researching dreams. Yet there is still no agreement on exactly how the brain works when we are dreaming or why we dream.

First John _ some trousers, but at last he _ a coat instead of them.	"John wanted to buy some new clothes, so he went to a shop.

The man gave him a coat and said ""This one costs the same as the trousers."" John took the coat and walked out of the shop. The shopkeeper ran after him and said, ""You have not paid for the coat!"" ""But I gave you the trousers for the coat,"" said John. ""They cost the same as the coat, aren't they?"" ""Yes,"" said the shopkeeper, ""But you didn't pay for the trousers!""

How do the teachers deal with students with excess energy?	If a child has a learning problem before he leaves the Second or Third Grade, it's difficult for him to study well. ADHD is one of the most common learning disabilities. Even with parents and doctors working together without schools' help, it is very hard to get rid of the disability. Sadly, even today, there are many schools that don't know how to deal with the children with these disabilities. Fairfield Primary School is a good place for children that have been diagnosed with ADHD. The teachers really care about all of their students and they are willing to work with parents and doctors in order to help these children. When they see the child want to act up in class, they usually give the child something physical to do in order to get rid of the excess energy. They never punish the child for something that is beyond the child's control. Overall, Fairfield Primary School has all of things that a child with ADHD needs. They provide interesting class games for the child's excess energy. They also provide the school rules the child needs. They give the child a caring environment where they are not kept apart because they are different. This is a very good school for a child who is suffering from one or more of these problems. We believe your child with ADHD can learn, change and succeed if they come to study in Fairfield Primary School.	['By asking them to play games.']

Which of the following measures is NOT mentioned to solve the population ageing problem?	There are many older people in the world and there will be many more. A little-known fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization, by 2020 there will be 1 billion, with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries. For example, it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent. It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk? One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live ,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability. Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible, including during old age, to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value the older people in their society. In some African countries, certainly in Asia, older people are respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge. Yet traditions are fading away daily, which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people. As society changes, attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination in employment. Life-long learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people. Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net. To achieve equality in such matters will take considerable time and effort. One thing is sure:there is no time to be lost.	['Providing free health care for sick older people.']

And now, even more research suggests that putting phones away before going to sleep is important to teens' well-being. A new study from Seton Hall University School of Health and Medicine Science found that 62 percent of kids used their smart phones before bed, and it's causing less sleep and poor performance in school. Those teens who text before bedtime tend to go to sleep later, and get up later in the morning. Such behavior can be associated with mental health issues like depression or anxiety. Besides, once teens do receive a text, experts found, they tend to respond right away. Then the text conversation continues -- resulting in an even later bedtime. The study's co-author Dr. Peter Polos says this leads to excessive stimulation at night. Light from electronic devices can block the secretion of melatonin -- a hormone that promotes sleep, which makes sleep difficult in the face of overuse of smart phones at night. It's true! More screen time means less sleep time; other studies have suggested the same idea. As for a final piece of advice, Dr. Sushanth Bhat says, since getting the proper amount of sleep is very important for brain development and learning in the teenage years, our study should encourage parents and guardians to limit adolescent smart phone usage at night. Keep in mind that teens aren't the only ones addicted to their phones! Adults can also benefit from setting a tech curfew for themselves. After all, kids learn by example!

The following is mentioned as being responsible for the road accidents except _ .	The motor vehicle has killed and disabled more people in its brief history than any bomb or weapon ever invented. Much of the blood on the street flows essentially from uncivil behavior of drivers who refuse to respect the legal and moral rights of others. So the massacre on the road may be regarded as a social problem . In fact, the enemies of society on wheels are rather harmless people just ordinary people acting carelessly, you might say. But it is a principle both of law and common morality that carelessness is no excuse when one's actions could bring death or damage to others. A minority of the killers go even beyond carelessness to total negligence . Researchers have pointed out that as many as 80 percent of all automobile accidents can result from the psychological condition of the driver. Emotional upsets can affect drivers' reactions, slow their judgment, and blind them to dangers that might otherwise be clear. The experts warn that it is important for every driver to make a conscious effort to keep one's emotion under control. Yet the irresponsibility that accounts for much of the problem is not only caused by drivers. Street walkers regularly go against traffic rules, they are to blame in most vehicle walker accidents , and many cyclists even believe that they don't obey the basic rules of the road. Significant legal advances have been made towards safer driving in the past few years. Safety standards for vehicle have been raised both at the point of manufacture and through regular road-worthiness inspections . In addition, speed limits have been lowered. Due to these measures, the accident rate has decreased. But the accident experts still worry because there has been little or no improvement in the way drivers behave. The only real and lasting solution, say the experts, is to convince people that driving is a skilled task requiring constant care and concentration. Those who fail to do all these things present a threat to those with whom they share the road.	['irresponsible manufacturers of automobiles']
According to this article, PBS received part of its funding from _ .	Though the Web is becoming increasingly popular, the TV never fails to attract people. Do you know which television network is the largest in America? It is not ABC, CBS, or Fox. Nor is it one of the cable net-works such as CNN, which carries only news and news stories. It is not ESPN, the all-sports cable net-work, or even MTV, which is famous for its music videos. Rather it is PBS, Public Broadcasting System, a non-profit public broadcasting TV service. PBS has 349 member television stations in the U. S. and some member stations by cable in Canada. PBS only attracts a minority of all TV viewers, about 2 percent. The industry leader, NBC, however, attracts 11 percent of viewers. But the growth of public television in the past two decades has been dramatic. This is especially noteworthy when one considers that public television stations must often survive on very limited budgets, on viewers' donations, and on private foundations and some governmental funding. The level of quality of PBS programs, whether in national and international news, entertainment, or education, is excellent. Almost a whole generation of children throughout the world is familiar with Sesame Street and the characters of The Muppet Show. PBS is especially well known for the quality of its many educational TV programs. Over 95 percent of all public television stations have tele-courses. These courses are accepted and supported by more than 1, 800 colleges and universities throughout the US. Each year, over a quarter of a million students take courses this way.	['the audience']
Jazz is a kind of music _ .	Music comes in many forms;most countries have a style of their own. Poland has its folks. Hungary has its czardas. Argentina is famous for the tango. The U.S.A.is known for jazz,the type of music that has gained worldwide popularity. Jazz is an American contribution to popular music. While classical music follows formal European tradition,jazz is rather a free form. It is full of energy,expressing the moods,interests,and emotions of the people. It is breaking and exciting with a modern sound. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And so it does today. The origins of the music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was invented by American Negroes,or blacks,as they are called today,who were brought to the southern states as slaves. They were sold to farm owners and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died his friends and s would gather and carry the body to have a ceremony before they buried him. There was always a band with them. On the way to the ceremony the band played slowly,solemn music suitable for the situation. But on the way home the mood changed. Spirits lifted. Everyone was happy. Death had removed one of their members,but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music. This music made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz. Music has always been important in Negro life. The black,who were brought to American from West Africa,had a rich musical tradition. In the fields,they made up work songs. Singing made the hard work go faster. And when they got to Christianity,they made lovely spirituals,which have become an everlasting part of American music.	['quite different from classical music']

The paper flew out of the window because of _ .	Last Sunday I saw the hardest storm in years. It came suddenly and went on for more than three hours. After lunch, I went into my room to have a rest. The air was hot, and all was quiet. Then the strong wind started blowing into my room. Pieces of paper on my desk flew high into the air and some flew out of the open window. As I ran out to catch them, big drops of rain began to fall. When I came back into the house, it was raining harder. I tried hard to close the window. Then I heard a loudcrashing sound from the back of the house. I ran out of my room to find out what it was--a big tree had fallen down and broken the top of the back room.	['the strong wind']
According to the passage,what does EDUN do?	"What is your favourite colour? Ask famous persons like Cate Blanchett,Searlett Johansson and Bono,and maybe they will say""green.""That's not because these artists particularly like the colour green.Instead,they are interested in green fashion. Green fashion is about making(and wearing)clothes that are good for humans,animals,and the Earth.In the past,green fashion made people think of hippies and ugly clothes.But today,green fashion is different.It is about looking good and caring about the Earth and other people.You can have interesting clothes and be green. Around the world,green fashion is becoming popular.For example,the U.K.company People Tree sells men's and women's clothing and accessories .They are made from natural fabrics like cotton and wool.Workers who make the clothes are from countries like Nepal,Kenya,and Bangladesh.People Tree pays the men and women good money for the clothes they create.

What is Natalie Hormilla's attitude toward eco-fashion?	"The January fashion show, called Future Fashion, exemplified how far green design has come. Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines. The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, a cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to find. ""Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren't comparable materials that can just replace what you're doing and what your customers are used to,"" he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents . Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers & Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable. It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional cotton at higher prices, thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material. ""Main-stream is about to occur,"" says Hahn. Some analysts are less sure. Among consumers, only 18% are even aware that eco-fashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer. When asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied, ""Not that I'm aware of."" Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she's on the hunt for ""cute stuff that isn't too expensive."" By her own admission, green just isn't yet on her mind. But thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers--one day it will be."	"[""She doesn't seem to care about it.""]"
What was the problem faced by the author and his brother?	"It was an extremely hot day. My younger brother Walt and I had decided to go swimming in the stream behind Mr Blickez's house, because it would be the only way to cool ourselves down. Across his farm and through some woods was a deep swimming hole supplied by several cold springs . The only problem with our plan was that this farm was guarded by a huge mean Hereford bull . Mr Blickez had told us that Elsie, the animal's name, was the meanest bull in town, maybe even the county, and we believed in him. But the hotter it got, the more we thought there was reason to doubt about what he said. For one thing, we remembered Mr Blickez liked telling tall tales; for another, Elsie seemed like a strange name for a bull. Finally, I talked Mom into asking permission for us to walk through the farm, and Mr Blickez finally agreed. On our way across the farm, we stopped at the fence to admire the swimming hole. The sun shone brightly across the cool waters. We couldn't wait to get there. Suddenly, Walt shouted loudly. Elsie had run to him and was licking his back. I immediately hid under the fence. However, when I looked up, I saw that Elsie wasn't a big mean bull at all. She was just a friendly young cow, and she was going to keep licking my brother's back as long as he stood still. When we discovered the truth, we were so happy. We then ran to the swimming hole and jumped in. The water was just as wonderful as we had dreamed. After that day, we had many good days and we often visited our secret swimming hole guarded by the so-called ""big mean bull""."	['They had to face a very mean bull.']
The following are all now true EXCEPT _ .	In the traditional marriage, the man worked at a job to earn money for the family. Most men worked in an office, a factory, or some other place away from the home. Since the man earned the money, they paid the bills. The money was used for food, -clothes, the house, and other family needs, the man made most of the decisions. He was the boss. In the traditional marriage, the woman seldom worked away from the house. She stayed at home to care for the children and her husband. She cooked meals, cleaned the house, washed the clothes, and did other housework. Her job at home was very important. In recent years, many couples continues to have a traditional relationship of the kind. The man has a job and earns the money for the family. The woman stays at home and cared for the children and the house. Many Americans are happy with the kind of marriage. But some other Americans have a different impression of marriage and family responsibilities. There are two important differences in male and female roles now. One is that both men and women have many more choices. They may choose to marry or to stay single. They may choose to work or stay at home. Both men and women may choose roles that are comfortable for them. A second difference in male and female roles is that within marriage many decisions and responsibilities are shared. The husband and wife may choose to have children, or they may not. If they have children, the man takes care of them some of the time, all of the time or not at all. The woman may want to stay at home and take care of the children, or she may vant to go to work. Men and women now decide these things together in a marriage. Many married people now share these decisions and responsibilities of their families.	['the woman is the most important person in the house']

The purpose of the passage is mainly to tell us how to _ .	A serious earthquake can be a terrible experience, and it is easy to forget safety measures in disorder . _ , most earthquake safety measures are common sense, but if you forget everything else, remember the following instructions: drop, cover, and hold on. Also, most of earthquake deaths happen after the earthquake, so remember that the danger does not end when the shaking does! If you stay indoors during an earthquake, move away from unsupported areas and windows. Try to get under a doorway or another area of the building which is held up by strong beams . Stay under a table or desk only if it is very strong. Do not rush to lifts, because it is far safer to stay where you are. Cover your head with your arms around it and curl into a ball, and wait for the shaking to stop. If you stay outdoors during an earthquake, move to an area which is as open as possible. Don't move to buildings, electric poles and other objects which may fall during an earthquake and injure you. Protect your head and stay low to the ground till the shaking ends and it is safe to move. After an earthquake, many buildings are less strong, although they appear safe. If you stay indoors, move people from the building quickly and help disabled or injured people. Once outdoors, move well away from the building so that if it falls down, you will not be injured. Wait till public safety officials announce that it is safe to stay indoors. By planning ahead and keeping calm during an earthquake, you can greatly increase your chances of survival without injury.

The title of the passage is _ .	Tea, the most important of English drinks, is a relative latecomer to British shores. Although the custom of drinking tea dates back to the third millennium BC in China, it was not until the mid 17 th century that tea first appeared in England. Afternoon tea was introduced in England by Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, in the year 1840. The Duchess would become hungry around four o'clock in the afternoon. The evening meal in her household was served fashionably late at eight o'clock, thus leaving a long period of time between lunch and dinner. The Duchess asked her servant to bring a tray of tea, bread, butter and cake to her room during the late afternoon. This became a habit of hers and she began inviting friends to join her. This pause for tea became a fashionable social event. During the 1880's upper class and society women would change into long gowns , gloves and hats for their afternoon tea which was usually served in the drawing room between four and five o'clock. Traditional afternoon tea consists of a selection of dainty sandwiches, scones served with cream and jams. Cakes and pastries are also served. Tea grown in India or Ceylon is poured from silver teapots into delicate bone china cups. Nowadays, however, in the average suburban home, afternoon tea is likely to be just a biscuit or small cake and a mug of tea, usually produced using a teabag.

The main purpose of making lists is to _ .	"Making lists is relaxing. It dictates the shape of the immediate future; it calms you down (it's OK, it's on a list somewhere) and it makes you feel good when you cross something off List-making is standard practice in therapy for depression). It might even help you to get things done too. The more you have to do, the more you need a list and few people with high-powered jobs get by without them. Women always think they're better at lists than men. Men tend to have tasks which they assemble 'into Action Plans whereas women just have lists of Things To Do. James Oliver, psychologist, has created his own ""time management matrix "". He writes a list of things to do and then organizes them into _ : things that have to be done straight away, other things that it would be good to do today, things that are important but haven't got to be done immediately and things that are less urgent but that he doesn't want to forget. ""Using categories to order the world is the way the human mind works,"" he says. ""After that, you should divide things into levels of importance."" But he also warns, ""If people get too absorbed in making lists, it doesn't work. They have too many categories and lose their ability to decide which is the most important."" It's all a question of what works best for you, whether it's a tidy notebook, a packet of Post-it notes or the back of your hand. Having tried all these, student Kate Rollins relies on a computerized list, which is printed out each morning. ""My electronic organizer has changed my life,"" she says. ""Up to now, I've always relied on my good memory, but now that I'm working and studying, I find I've got too much to keep in my head."" So what are you waiting for? No, you're not too busy to make today the first day of your upgraded time-managed life. In fact, there's no better time than the present to begin to take increased control of your work and life. So, get out your pencil and pen and make a list."	"[""organize one's work and life reasonably""]"
The multipurpose robot may be identified as a machine that_.	"Robots have proved to be valuable tools for soldiers,surgeons and homeowners hoping to keep the carpet clean. But in each case,they are designed and built specifically for the job. Now there is a movement under way to build multipurpose machines-robots that can move about in changing environments such as offices or living rooms and work with their hands. All-purpose robots are not,of course,a new idea.""It's been five or 10 years from happening for about 50 years,""says Eric Berger,co-director of the Personal Robotics Program at Willow Garage,a Silicon Valley organization. The delay is in part because even simple tasks require a huge set of capabilities. For a robot to fetch a mug,for example,it needs to make sense of data gathered by a variety of sensors-laser scanners identifying potential blocking objects,cameras searching for the target,force feedback in the fingers that grasp the mug,and more. Yet Berger and other experts are confident that real progress could be made in the next decade. The problem,according to Willow Garage,is the lack of a common platform for all that computational effort. Instead of enlarging the capabilities of a single machine,everyone is designing robots and the software to control them,from the ground up. To help change this,Willow Garage is currently producing 25 copies of its model PR2 (for""Personal Robot 2""),a two-armed,wheeled machine that can switch off the electricity,open doors and move through a room. Ten of the robots will stay in-house,but 10 more will go t o outside research groups,and everyone will share their advances. This way,Berger says,if you want to build the robotic equivalent of a Twitter ,you won't start by constructing a computer.""You build the thing that's new."""

"Dreams are sometimes called ""secret messages to ourselves"" because _ ."	"Early one morning,more than a hundred years ago,an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep.He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem: It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Though he was tired,Howe slept badly.He turned and turned.Then he had a dream.He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine.When he tried to do so,Howe ran into the same problem as before.The thread kept getting caught around the needle.The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe.They came up towards him with their spears raised.But suddenly the inventor noticed something.There was a hole in the tip of each spear.The inventor awoke from the dream,realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem.Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle,he should make it run through a small hole in the center of the needle.This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Elias Howe was not the only one in finding the answer to his problem in this way.Thomas Edison,the inventor of the electric light,said his best ideas came into him in dreams.So did the great physicist Albert Einstein.Charlotte Bronte also drew in her dreams in writing Jane Eyre. To know the value of dreams,you have to understand what happens when you are asleep.Even then,a part of your mind is still working.This unconscious ,but still active part understands your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.It stores all sorts of information that you may have forgotten or never have really noticed.It is only when you fall asleep that this part of the brain can send messages to the part you use when you are awake.However,the unconscious part acts in a special way.It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first.This is why dreams are sometimes called ""secret messages to ourselves ""."

Cardiff's programme allows a free bike for a maximum period of _ .	Planning a visit to the UK? Here we help with ways to cut your costs. AVOID BIG EVENTS Big sporting events, concerts and exhibitions can increase the accommodation and make it harder to find a room. A standard double room at the Thistle Brighton on the final Friday of the Brighton Comedy Festival (19, Oct.) cost PS 169.15 at Booking. Com. A week later, the same room cost PS 118.15. If you can be flexible and want to know dates to avoid - or you're looking for a big event to pass your time - check out sites such as Whatsonwhen.com, which allow you to search for events in the UK by city, date and category. STAY AWAY FROM THE STATION If travelling to your destination by train, you may want to find a base close to the station, but you could end up paying more for the sake of convenience at the start of your holiday. Don't be too choosy about the part of town you stay in. Booking two months in advance, the cheapest room at Travelodge's Central Euston hotel in London for Saturday 22 September was PS 95.95. A room just a tube journey away at its Covent Garden hotel was PS 75.75. And at Farringdon, a double room cost just PS 62.95. LOOK AFTER YOURSELF Really central hotels in cities such as London, Edinburgh and Cardiff can cost a fortune, especially at weekends and during big events. As an alternative consider checking into a self-catering flat with its own kitchen. Often these flats are hidden away on the top floors of city centre buildings. A great example is the historic O'Neill Flat on Edinburgh's Royal Mile, available for PS 420 for five days in late September, with room for four adults. GET ON A BIKE London's 'Boris bikes' have attracted the most attention, but other cities also have similar programmes that let you rent a bicycle and explore at your own pace, saving you on public transport or car parking costs. Among the smaller cities with their own programmes are Newcastle (casual members pay around PS 1.50 for two hours) and Cardiff (free for up to 30 minutes, or PS 5 per day).	['half an hour']

When offered help, the author at first felt _ .	"Moving can bring out the best and the worst in people, I'm finding. And I've discovered where a very generous spirit lives: Defiance, Ohio. After suffering through many months of unemployment, my wife and I had to move this week from Colorado to Ohio, where she would work as a sales assistant. Not knowing a person there, we were pretty concerned about all the work, including how we'd get all the things unloaded without killing ourselves. We decided to pay a couple of college students to help with all the heavy lifting once we got there. But one neighbor after another stopped by and joined in. ""What? Have we moved to some other country? Maybe we've died and gone to heaven!"" I thought. Unloading actually became fun as we connected with so many wonderful new friends as we worked. The more people that helped, the easier the work became. A job we were afraid might take days for the two of us alone was done in just a few hours. Many total strangers would either walk by or drive by to ask us if we were moving in. Many were delighted that this fine old house that had sat empty for so long was coming to life again. We were invited to an outdoor meal yesterday by neighbors on the same street. All the while, my brain was on this new sense of hope that people could be outgoing and kind to strangers. Among all the conversations were lots of offers to be of help to one another in a variety of ways. It's wonderful to live in such a kind little town. I feel so grateful to be here, and wish the rest of the world could see how an entire society can be a model for what it's like to look out for one another.

What is the best title for the text?	"The origins of blues are not unlike the origins of life. For many years it was recorded only by memory, and relayed only live, and in person. The blues were born in the North Mississippi Delta following the Civil War. Influenced by African roots, field hollers , ballads, church music and rhythmic dance tunes called jump-ups evolved into a music for a singer who would engage in call-and-response with his guitar. He would sing a line, and the guitar would answer. From the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, and the platform of the Clarksdale Railway Station, the blues headed north to Beale Street in Memphis. The blues have strongly influenced almost all popular music including jazz, country, and rock and roll and continue to help shape music worldwide. Bad luck and trouble are always present in the Blues. Relentless rhythms repeat the chants of sorrow, and the pity of a lost soul many times over. The blues form was first popularized about 1911-14 by the black composer W.C. Handy. However, the poetic and musical form of the blues first crystallized around 1910 and gained popularity through the publication of Handy's Memphis Blues(1912) and St.Louis Blues(1914). Instrumental blues had been recorded as early as 1913. During the twenties, the blues became a national craze. Mamie Smith recorded the first vocal blues song, Crazy Blues in 1920. In the early 1960s, the urban bluesmen were ""discovered"" by young white American and European musicians. Many blues-based bands brought the blues to young white audiences. Since the sixties, rock has undergone several blues revivals. Some rock guitarists have used the blues as a foundation for offshoot styles. The latest generation of blues players like Robert Cray and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, gracing the blues tradition with their incredible technicality , have drawn a new generation listeners to the blues."

What do we learn about the man?	The man traveling in the back of the ambulance which was running at a high speed along the streets of Baltimore that morning in2008 had no business to be alive. By everything that was reasonable, and there were plenty of such things before, he should have been very dead indeed. But he wasn't. As the people in the hospital pointed out after they had examined him, he was only slightly hurt. Yet he had just fallen 150 feet down a hotel lift shaft! Unknown to the man, two things had occurred which were to affect his life that day. On the thirteenth floor of the hotel, somebody had carelessly left the lift gate open. Down in the basement, a pipe had burst and it had flooded from the bottom of the lift shaft to a depth of two feet. Modern lifts have all sorts of fail-safe system to prevent accidents, but this was ancient equipment unreliable, slow, dangerous, and unsuitable material to recycle. The man had plenty of things to occupy his mind that morning. He had overslept. The hotel had forgotten to call him and now he was late for an important business appointment. He dressed quickly, shaved hurriedly, took hold of his briefcase and hurried off down the hotel corridor. Good! The lift gate was open. The lift must be there. He need not press the button and wait while the large, clumsy lift made its way upwards. Without looking or thinking, he stepped out into space, The lift cage was, in fact, one floor above him on the fourteenth. The lift shaft which he had walked was a narrow space of not very fresh air, ending150 feet below in two feet of dirty water. The man fell, making his journey to the ground at a speed he had never dreamed of. Confused patterns, a rush of air, time enough to be afraid, split-second thoughts of death, then crash! Perhaps this gave him the record for some sort of high-diving act. No doubt in future he always looked before he jumped. Certainly he learnt that this was no way to save time. The experts said that those two feet of water had saved his life.	['He fell from the 13th floor.']
With 3G, you can do the following EXCEPT _ .	"Thirdgeneration mobile phones, known as 3G, are the next big step for the telecom industry. Data speed in 3G networks is much quicker than present technology. This means users can have highspeed Internet access and enjoy video and CDquality music on their phones.

In May 2000 the US Government issued five licenses to run 3G wireless services, while the first 3G phones arrived in Italy in March this year. International telecom companies can't wait to sell 3G in China, the world's largest mobile telecommunications market. But they will have to be patient. At the moment, China is busy testing its 3Gbased technologies, networks and services. This will be followed by a trial period before the phones can finally hit the shops.

What is implied but not stated in the passage?	"Full face transplants are no longer science fiction fantasy, a leading surgeon has said, adding that they are technically feasible but ethically complex. Peter Butler from London's Royal Free Hospital called for a debate on the ethics of such an operation made possible by new drugs whichstop the body's immune system rejecting a transplanted face. ""It is not 'Can we do it?' but 'Should we do it?'"" he told the BBC.""The technical part is not complex, but I don't think that's going to be the very great difficulty. The ethical and moral debate is obviously going to have to take place before the first facial transplantation.""

But surgeons could have trouble finding enough willing donors. prefix = st1 /Butlersaid his survey of doctors, nurses and members of the public showed most would accept a face transplant but few were willing to donate their own after dying. Despite a number of ethical concerns, Christine Piff, who founded the charity Let's Face It after suffering a rare facial cancer 25 years ago, welcomed the possibility of face transplants. She rejected the idea that the procedure would mean people would end up living with a dead person's face. ""There are so many people without faces, I have half a face... but we are all so much more than just a face... you don't take on their personality. You are still you,"" she told reporters. ""If we can donate other organs of the body, then why not the face? I can't see anything wrong with it."""	['The main difficulty with the operation lies in the matter of ethics and morality.']
What is the author's attitude towards biomass fuels?	Across countryside, non-food crops are growing alongside wheat.Some are used in new alternatives to plastics and other materials, but others will simply be burned. Burning crops is becoming more popular because it is good for the planet.Doing so is also cheaper than burning fossil fuels.As more land is devoted to non-food crop production, the economics of crops for fuel are likely to become even more favorable. Humans have been burning such biomass--organic materials from plants or animals-- since they discovered fire.But that burning fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences has brought biomass back into fashion. Even allowing for emissions of carbon dioxide from fuel used in planting, harvesting, processing and transporting biomass fuel, replacing fossil fuel with biomass can typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90 percent. Power stations around the world are experimenting with forms of biomass to add to their coal or oil, with encouraging results.Indeed, power companies could profit by turning to biomass, especially when the subsidies many governments offer for using renewable energy are taken into account. Farmers can benefit from growing biomass.In Europe, the reduction of subsidies for certain crops is exposing farmers to market forces.Instead of being paid for whatever they produce, farmers must seek a clear demand for their product.Many believe that the demand for alternatives to fossil fuels could be just such a driver. But while biomass offers a variety of potential alternatives, the world's infrastructure has developed around burning fossil fuels to such a stage that switching to biomass involves a change in conception that many companies have not accepted. Also, there are problems with using biomass.Although most coal-fired power stations could take a small amount of their fuel from biomass without significant adjustment, few are built to run on biomass alone.Burning some forms of biomass also causes environmental problems.Oils and waste can be smelly, while wood produces smoke unless burned properly. The supply chains for fossil fuels are set up well, but those for biomass are just the beginning. Sources of supply for biomass rely on farm production and can therefore be less reliable. They are necessarily limited and it wouldn't make sense to turn a very large amount of valuable agricultural land away from food crops.But as the world adjusts to the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, these problems may receive more attention.

According to the text, Alice Munro _ .	"Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called Alice Munro a ""master of the contemporary short story"". ""She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to live a little bit in the shadow of the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,"" he said. The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13thwoman to win the Nobel Prize for literature since its start in 1901. ""I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,"" Munro told Canadian media. Alice Munro: ""I would really hope that this would make people see the short story as an important art form."" Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950. Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award. In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work -- but she downplayed her achievements. ""I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents,"" she once said in an interview. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been ""at the very top of her game since she started"". ""Very few writers are her equal,"" he said, adding ""She gets to the heart of what it is to be human"". The award ""probably won't make a commercial difference"" to the author, he added, but it ""makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"". ""If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission ."" Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town. Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came over the Mountain."	['is very good at writing short stories']
Which of these can you conclude from reading the article?	Nearly everyone is shy in some ways.If shyness is making you uncomfortable,it may be time for a few lessons in self-confidence.You can build your confidence by following some suggestions from doctors and psychologists. Make a decision not to hold back in conversations,What you have to say is just as important as what other people say.And don't turn down party invitations just because of your shyness. Prepare yourself for being with others in groups.Make a list of the good qualities you have.Then make a list of ideas,experiences,and skills you would like to share with other people. Think about what you would like to say in advance.Then say it. If you start feeling self-conscious in a group,take a deep breath and focus your attention on other people.Remember, you are not alone.Other people are concerned about the impression they are making,too. No one ever gets over being shy completely, but most people do learn to live with their shyness. Even entertainers admit that they often feel shy.They work at fighting their shy feelings so that they can face the cameras and the public.Just making the effort to control shyness can have many rewards.But perhaps the best reason to fight shyness is to give other people a chance to know more about you.

The writer thinks _ .	"There were two interesting pieces of news items in the paper a few years ago. One was about a man who received a bill from the telephone company for $ 2,000 a month for doing nothing. The connection between the two news items is simple; computers-the best invention of the 20th century. The telephone bill came from a computer which made a terrifying mistake; that man's bill was only $ 23.26. The other item was not as amusing. A man walked into the unguarded computer room of a large packaged food company and expertly programmed the computer to pay him $ 2,000 a month for raw meat which he ""supplied "" to the company. Of course he never sent the meat, but he certainly received the money . The computer wrote out a bill, and even ""signed "" it. It was only a random check that uncovered the trick. It could be happening in thousands of other companies all over the world. Computers are not the magical workers that some people say they are. They make mistakes, they're sometimes slower than human beings and they're easily fooled. The US used to conscript people with the help of a computer. The army sent out a card, which had to be filled in and sent back. It was easy to avoid being called up simply by spreading candle-wax on the card. The computer couldn't read the card, and did nothing with it. It's in our everyday life that computers cause many problems. Let's get back to using people instead of computers, before a mistake that we can't put right."	"[""we'd better use people instead of computers in our everyday life""]"
Who did the old lady finally turn to for help?	"The owner of a missing cat is asking for help. ""My baby has been missing for over a month now, and I want him back so badly,"" said Mrs. Brown, a 56-year-old woman. Mrs. Brown lives by herself in a trailer park near Clovis. She said that Clyde, her 7-year-old cat, didn't come home for dinner more than a month ago. The next morning he didn't appear for breakfast either. After Clyde missed an extra-special lunch, she called the police. When the policeman asked her to describe Clyde, she told him that Clyde had beautiful green eyes, had all his teeth but was missing half of his left ear, and was seven years old and completely white. She then told the officer that Clyde was about a foot high. A bell went off. ""Is Clyde your child or your pet?"" the officer suspiciously asked. ""Well, he's my cat, of course,"" Mrs. Brown replied. ""Lady, you're supposed to report missing PERSONS, not missing CATS,"" said the _ policeman. ""Well, who can I report this to?"" she asked. ""You can't. You have to ask around your neighborhood or put up flyers,"" replied the officer. Mrs. Brown figured that a billboard would work a lot better than an 8""x11"" piece of paper on a telephone pole. There was an empty billboard at the end of her street just off the interstate highway. The billboard had a phone number on it. She called that number, and they told her they could blow up a picture of Clyde (from Mrs. Brown's family album) and put it on the billboard for all to see. ""But how can people see it when they whiz by on the interstate?"" she asked. ""Oh, don't worry, ma'am, they only whiz by between 2 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. The rest of the day, the interstate is so full of commuters that no one moves."" They told her it would cost only $3,000 a month. So she took most of the money out of her savings account and rented the billboard for a month. The month has passed, but Clyde has not appeared. Because she has almost no money in savings, Mrs. Brown called the local newspaper to see if anyone could help her rent the billboard for just one more month. She is waiting but, so far, no one has stepped forward."	['The police']
Scientists study El Nino in order that _ .	Scientists around the world have been studying the warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean known as El Nino . The appearance of El Nino is known to affect the weather around the world. Scientists still do not completely understand it. Yet they now find they can use it to tell about the future in different areas of the world. One example is the work of two scientists at Columbia University in New York, Mark Cane and Gordon Eshel. A scientist of Zimbabwe , Roger Buckland worked with them. They have found that when El Nino appears, Zimbabwe has little or no rain. This means corn crops in Zimbabwe are poor. The last El Nino was in 1991 to 1993. That was when southeastern Africa suffered a serious lack of rain. The scientists wrote about their recent work in the publication Nature. Their computer program can tell when an El Nino will develop up to a year before it does. They suggest that this could provide an effective early warning system for southern Africa, and could prevent many people from starving.

The man living below where Edward lived was _ .	"The pounding was driving Edward crazy. A new neighbor had just moved into the apartment below him. The newcomer was deaf, or seemed to be, because he played his stereo loud enough for the whole building to hear. On the first day he heard the stereo rocking over, Edward marched downstairs and politely told the newcomer that his stereo was too loud. He asked the new tenant to turn the volume down and keep it down as long as he lived in the building. The tenant appeared surprised and embarrassed, and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that loud."" So, Edward returned upstairs, feeling good, because he had taken a stand and politely let the newcomer know that loud music was not going to be tolerated. The next day all was quiet, and Edward continued to be pleased with himself. The following day, Edward thought it must be Fourth of July, because a marching band was playing on his street. In fact, it was the new neighbor who was playing his music loud again. Edward was not one to repeat himself, feeling that each time you repeated yourself, you diminished the value of your words. So, he did what he always did with rude neighbors-grin and bear it. Eventually, they would move away. What else are you going to do? In Los Angeles a year ago, a woman had complained to her upstairs neighbor that he was playing his drums too loud and too often. The drummer repeatedly ignored her. One day the woman walked upstairs and shot the drummer in the head and his girlfriend in the chest. The woman was sentenced to prison for 20 years.

The research from Cardiff University was based on the people's _ .	Country-dwellers often say the constant noise, heavy traffic and crowds of the city would drive them mad. Well, they might be right, according to the latest research. City residents are more likely to develop mental illnesses than those who live in villages, a study has found. Researchers from Cardiff university examined the lifestyles of more than 200,000 people in Sweden and found that those who lived in urban areas were more at risk from mental illnesses than people who lived in villages. The experts don't know exactly why this is but they suggest that town and city residents are more likely to be ostracized by those around them. They are more likely to experience discrimination if they do not fit in, which can lead to them feeling anxious and even developing mental illnesses. Dr Stanley Zammit, who led the research said that people living in towns and cities are more likely to develop other mental illnesses that result in personality changes -- a condition known as non-affective psychosis . Earlier this year an official report found that village-dwellers live an average of two years longer than those living in towns and cities. According to figures from the Office of National Statistics in the UK, men who live in villages are likely to live for between 78 and 79 years, while those in towns and cities can expect to survive to an age of 76. Women on average survive to their 81stbirthday in towns and cities, but live to between 82 and 83 in villages. The small marked town of Wimborne Minster in rural Dorset was named the healthiest place to live in.	['lifestyles.']

Thirty-some years of marriage can do that to a woman. Give a man pruning shears and electric trimmers and he will give new meaning to ""armed and dangerous.""

It's March,"" I said. ""It looked sick last fall and with this bitter winter we had, I'm convinced it's dead."" The truth is he's never liked the crab apple. Sure, it has beautiful blooms in the spring, but then it gets a disease, the leaves curl, and it drops those little apples that sit on the driveway. Each passing week he pronounced the tree dead. Eventually I began to believe him. Though he agreed it would be a regrettable loss, there was a twinkle in his eye. He armed himself a couple of weeks ago and began trimming. A branch here, a branch there, a small limb, then a large limb. I watched and then decided to check the wood on some of the branches closer to the trunk. I broke one off and saw green. The crab apple was not dead. It just hadn't had time to leaf out. The tree was now falling to one side, but it was not dead. I would have told him so, but he had moved on to a maple. Once the man starts, he can't stop. One trim leads to another. ""Please, stop!"" I called.

What do scientists think is the biggest danger facing Antarctica?	"The hole in the Earth's ozone layer has until now protected Antarctica from the worst effects of global warming. But scientists have warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3oC on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea level increase of up to 1.4 metres. In the past decades the western Antarctic has seen rapid ice loss as the world has warmed, but the other parts of the continent have, _ , been cooling, resulting in a 10% increase in ice in the seas around the region. This is because the hole in the ozone layer has increased cold winds in Antarctica, making much of the continent surface colder than usual. But now that the gasses that cause the ozone hole have been banned, scientists expect the hole to repair itself within the next 50 to 60 years. By then the cooling effect will have faded out and the Antarctic will face the full impact of global warming. This means an increase in average air temperatures of around 3OC and a reduction in sea ice by around a third. The biggest threat to the continent comes from warming seas. Robert Johnson, a scientist who monitors Antarctica ice sheets, said, ""The ice sheets in Antarctica are hundreds of metres thick. But once warm ocean waters start flowing underneath, the ice will begin thinning and could break up very quickly. ""Thinning ice sheets cause ice to break away from the continent and to melt even faster. Escaping ice from western Antarctica has already resulted in a 10% rise in global sea level in recent decades. Johnson believes that international action to reduce global warming is required immediately or it may be too late. ""Everything is connected - Antarctica may be a long way away but it is an important part of the Earth's system,"" said Johnson. ""It contains 90% of the world's ice, 70% of the world's fresh water and that is enough, if it melts completely, to raise sea levels by 63 metres."" Even in a worse-case situation scientists don't expect the ice to entirely disappear, but predict that, because of the melting ice sheets, average sea level rise will be around 1.4 metres higher by the end of the century."

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their ""tag"" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines."	['street art is drawing more attention']
John Simpson thinks that _ .	"British potato farmers were angry and wanted the expression ""couch potato"" to be taken out of the dictionary because it harmed the vegetable's image. The British Potato Council wants the Oxford English Dictionary to replace the expression with the term ""couch slouch"", with protests being outside Parliament in London and the offices of Oxford University Press. Kathryn Race, head of marketing at the Council, which represents some 4,000 planters and processors, said the group had complained in writing to the OED but had yet to receive a response. ""We are trying to get rid of the image that potatoes are bad for you,"" she said on Monday. ""The potato has had its knocks in the past. Of course it is not the Oxford English Dictionary's fault but we want to use another term instead of ""couch potato"" because potatoes are naturally healthy."" The OED says that ""couch potato"" began as American slang, meaning ""a person who spends his or her leisure time sitting around, especially watching television or video tapes."" The Potato Council says its campaign is backed by dieticians who say the vegetable is low in fat and high in vitamin C. Supporting the campaign, famous cook Antony Worrall Thompson said the vegetable was one of Britain's favorite foods. ""Not only are they healthy, they are also convenient and yummy . Life without potato is like a sandwich without a filling,"" he said. John Simpson, chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, said the dictionary first included the term ""couch potato"" in 1993 and said ""dictionaries just reflect the words that society uses."" Simpson said words were never taken out of the full-length dictionary, which includes some 650,000 words in 20 volumes. But little-used words can be removed from the smaller dictionaries to make way for newer ones. ""If society stops using words then they get taken out of the smaller dictionaries,"" he added. The first known recorded use of the expression ""couch potato"" was in an article in Los Angeles Times, in 1979, Simpson said.

Which would be the best title of the passage?	"""Folk singers are more like poets than singers,"" Li Yahe, a music businessman, once told China Youth Daily. That saying perfectly describes Zhang Lei, the 34-year-old champion of the fourth ""Voice of China"" singing competition, which ended on Oct 7. Critics thought Zhang's success as a victory for folk singers. The Voice of China used to attach great importance to singing skills and vocal techniques, which are not necessarily what folk singers are good at. ""Folk songs are more about emotions and storytelling,"" said Li. Folk is one of the oldest musical styles. It dates back to ancient times, when people sang about their everyday lives and the society around them. A powerful comeback Folk music became popular again in the Western world in the 1960s. During social revolutions, many young Westerners turned to the simple rhythms of folk. Pioneers included US singer Bob Dylan, whose songs are reflections of some social issues like the Vietnam War. Singers at that time used traditional folk instruments like the banjo, the upright bass, the mandolin and the piano. In the late 1970s, folk music was introduced to Taiwan. The rise of singers like Lo Tayu and Chyi Yu popularized folk music, particularly among young Chinese people. At that time, folk tunes were based on simple song structures, with pleasant chord progression and pretty lyrics, just like during old times. But they focused more on the dreams and sorrow of youth than on politics. This continued to be the case when the folk ""wave"" swept Chinese mainland in the 1990s. Folk pioneers Sadly, _ didn't last long in China. Folk gave way to pop in the late 1990s, when people started living more fast-paced lives. But that didn't mean folk music had disappeared from the music world entirely. ""The drop in the popularity of folk songs is because the business mode of the music industry is outdated, not because of the music itself,"" folk singer Song Ke once said. He was right. Recent years have seen folk songs gaining popularity, with the appearance of singers like Li Jian and Song Dongye. ""The popularity of the Internet has shocked the traditional profit model in music industry,"" Lu Zhongqiang, manager of 13-Month, a music recording and publishing company, told Tencent Entertainment. ""Not-so-well-known music starts showing its strength when the production of mainstream music is declining,"" he added."	['The History of Folk Music.']

When did the terrorist attack happen?	"The events of Saturday night in Kunming are deeply engraved in the mind of Xie Qiming, who narrowly escaped death in the terrorist attack at the city's railway station. The 48-year-old policeman intervened to stop the butchering of unarmed civilians, saving many from death and injury, but he was injured in the process. Lying in a hospital bed, his head and nose marked by serious hacking wounds - one more than 20 centimeters long - Xie recounted his actions on the day he describes as a nightmare. ""I shot at them but fell to the ground during the fighting. After the shots, the terrorists turned their attention to the police and several of them surrounded me and stabbed me like crazy,"" he said. ""There is no humanity in them."" Xie is from the Beijinglu Police Station, the closest to the attack, and four police officers from the station were the first to respond. He survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which was damaged by the attackers. When the officers arrived, the attackers were running out of the ticket hall, attacking people with long knives. Xie and his colleagues tried to stop the attack, which is when Xie was injured. In addition to the deep cuts, his skull was fractured, and at the time of writing he was awaiting further surgery. ""A wave of fierce anger rose up in my mind, and we all forgot to think about the possible danger to us,"" said Hu Zhe, 23, a police officer trainee at the Beijinglu Police Station. Having no firearm, he fought the terrorists with a wooden baton, but it got broken in the fighting. He sustained a 6-centimeter wound to his left eyebrow. Wan Weiqing, a neurosurgeon from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, learned of the attack at 2 am on Sunday and took the first flight to Kunming, where he has been helping the victims. He said that 71 victims are being treated at the Kunming First People's Hospital, most of them with severe multiple injuries. ""There is one victim whose rib, breastbone, lung and even heart were all injured in one chopping action. The attackers had obviously prepared and practiced for a long time,"" he said. Zhou Hongmei, director of the Medical Reform Office at the Yunnan Health Department, said a team of medical experts including 29 doctors had arrived in Kunming by Monday night. They have been working at the five hospitals treating victims of the attack. Chen Min, a Neurology Department nurse at Kunming First People's Hospital, said the department usually had seven nurses in the daytime and three at night. ""But all the other nurses who were not on duty returned to the hospital voluntarily on Saturday night,"" she said. In the past three days, none of them had more than 10 hours of rest. ""The crucial factor in saving lives in such incidents is treatment without delay,"" said Chai Wenzhao, associate director of the Intensive Care Unit in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Chai has participated in many emergency rescue efforts. He said that the victims will need psychological counseling once their physical injuries have been dealt with, because the emotional impact of such an incident can be severe. Four psychologists from Anding Hospital in Beijing have begun treating some of the victims."	['Three days before the report came out.']
What's the attitude of the author towards the passage?	Does being rich make you happy? Many studies on happiness give negative answers. Here are some points in being happy. Basic Human Needs Must Be Met People whose basic needs for shelter, clothing and food are not met will find it very difficult to feel happy. Of course, there are exceptions, but for most of us, we can only be happy once our basic needs are met. The Joneses Cannot Be Escaped People's happiness is not determined by how much they have, but by how much people around them have. So, we tend to feel happy once our basic needs are met and we have more than the people surrounding us. This means that while keeping up with _ could be destructive if we let it go too far. It is also part of humana nature to want to feel at least on the same level, financially, as those surrounding us. You Should Escape The Rat Race We should know the importance of staying out of the rat race. So yes, you need to work hard, get the education you need to land a good job and work long enough and hard enough to get to a place where you can easily meet your basic needs. What are basic needs? For most middle or upper middle class Americans, basic needs are not very basic anymore. For most of us, once our basic needs have been met, happiness is achieved when we engage in activities we like, spend time with friends and family and stay active. Making money for the sake of making money does not make people happy. Ideally, these questions should be answered when you're still young and just starting out. Don't wait until your midlife crisis to realize that half your life has passed you by and you're still unhappy.	"[""Money is a big problem, but money isn't everything.""]"
What effect does reading have on the author?	I grew up in a house where the TV was seldom turned on and with one wall in my bedroom entirely lined with bookshelves, most of my childhood was spent on books I could get hold of. In fact, I grew up thinking of reading as natural as breathing and books unbelievably powerful in shaping perspectives by creating worlds we could step into, take part in and live in. With this unshakable belief, I, at fourteen, decided to become a writer. Here too, reading became useful. Every writer starts off knowing that he has something to say, but being unable to find the right ways to say it. He has to find his own _ by reading widely and discovering which parts of the writers he agrees or disagrees with, or agrees with so strongly that it reshapes his own world. He cannot write without loving to read, because only through reading other people's writing can one discover what works, what doesn't and, in the end, together with lots of practice, what voice he has. Now I am in college, and have come to realize how important it is to read fiction. As a law student, my reading is in fact limited to subject matter -- the volume of what I have to read for classes every week means there is little time to read anything else. Such reading made it all the clearer to me that I live in a very small part in this great place called life. Reading fiction reminds me that there is life beyond my own. It allows me to travel across the high seas and along the Silk Road, all from the comfort of my own armchair, to experience, though secondhand, exciting experiences that I wouldn't necessarily be able to have in my lifetime.

Why is asbestos a sought-after building material?	Scientists are closely concerned with the structure of buildings and with the quality of building materials. The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air. Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material. As early as 1931, however, public health officers in the prefix = st1 /United Kingdomrevealed the connection between breathing in asbestos dust and such diseases as lung cancer. The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms. The better the homes are insulated, the more is the dangerous gas in indoor air. The main effect of this dangerous gas on health is to increase the risk of lung cancer.

Why American people call it a black day?	"The Friday after the American holiday of Thanksgiving is called Black Friday. It's said that it's the day that store ledgers move into the black and companies become profitable. On that day, retailers slash prices to get consumers to buy. It is also a time when many Americans start their Christmas shopping. VOA's Elizabeth Lee tells us how the economy may affect consumers on that bargain day. This day should be a shopper's dream. ""It's just the deals, the sales and everything you can get for a lesser price,"" said Sandy Thomas, a shopper. But it's a nightmare for others. ""I think it's crazy. I've done all of my shopping throughout the week so I don't have to go out on Friday,"" she said. It's called Black Friday, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season in the United States. Every year it's the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Stores open before sunrise and there are deep discounts everywhere you look. Last year a crowd of bargain-hunters killed a Wal-mart worker in a New York suburb. This year, many stores are increasing security while they slash prices. ""This is a huge time for the retail stores,"" said Fred Joutz from George Washington University. ""This is when they begin making their profits for the year."" Economics professor Fred Joutz says how Americans spend the weekend after Thanksgiving is a good indication of how consumers feel about the future. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Joutz says Americans are saving more and spending less. Some retailers are attracting consumers by opening on Thanksgiving Day, when shops are traditionally closed. Other stores open their doors anywhere from midnight to four in the morning. And shoppers will be lining up in front of the doors in order to be one of the first ones to walk through and get a big discount. Electronics like flat screen TVs are usually the first items to go. Sandy Thomas says it's an annual family tradition and well worth it. ""I just save maybe half of what I would have spent on a regular, you know, shopping trip,"" she said. Economists say U.S. consumers will spend money this Black Friday, but they will spend it more carefully."	['Because there are too many people going out shopping for Christmas.']
What does the children's song really mean?	"Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold. This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children. When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own. Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow."	['Old friends are as important as new ones.']
Which of the following is Dr.David's opinion?	"Judging from recent surveys, most experts in sleep behavior agree that there is virtually an epidemic of sleepiness in the nation.""I can't think of a single study that hasn't found Americans getting less sleep than they ought to,"" says Dr.David.Even people who think they are sleeping enough would probably be better off with more rest. The beginning of our sleep-deficit(lack)crises can be traced back to the invention of the light bulb a century ago.From diary entries and our personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have reached the conclusion that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night.""The best sleep habits once were forced on us, when we had nothing to do in the evening down on the farm, and it was dark."" By the 1950s and 1960s, the sleep schedule had been reduced dramatically, to between 7.5 and 8 hours, and most people had to wake to an alarm clock.""People cheat in their sleep, and they don't even realize they're doing it,"" says Dr.David.""They think they're okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, when they really need 7.5, 8 or even more to feel ideally energetic. "" Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researches say, is the complexity of the day.Whenever pressures from work, family, friends and community increase, many people consider sleep the least expensive item on their programs.""In our society, you're considered dynamic if you say you need only 5.5 hours' sleep.If you've got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition."" To determine the consequences of sleep-deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or recall a passage read to them only minutes earlier.""We've found that if you're in sleep deficit, performance suffers,"" says Dr.David.""Short-term memory is weakened, as are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate."""

The author's main purpose in writing the passage was to _ .	"Although man has known asbestos for hundreds of years, it was not until 160 years ago that it was mined for the first time on the North American continent. H.W.Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers,was responsible for the opening of that first mine. Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves,which looked much like ordinary work gloves,he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increased business in asbestos roofing materials. However,because it was very expensive to transport them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein, in the province of Quebec in Canada. Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral,which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen. When it is mined, the asbestos is heavy, just as you would expect a mineral to be. When it is separated,a strange thing happens; the rock breaks down into fine, soft, soapy fibers. Scientists do not know why the rock can be separated easily into threads ,but they have found thousands of uses of this fireproof material, of the so- called ""cloth of stone."""

Global warming is an important cause of koalas' reduction because _ .	"Australia's koalas could be wiped out within 30 years unless urgent action is taken to stop the losing in population, according to researchers They say development, climate change and bushfires have all combined to reduce the number of wild koalas sharply. The Australian Koala Foundation said a recent survey showed the population could have dropped by more than half in the past six years. Previous estimates put the number of koalas at more than 100,000, but the latest calculations suggest there could now be as few as 43,000. The foundation collected field data from 1,800 sites and 80,000 trees to calculate the numbers. In one area in northern Queensland estimated to have 20,000 koalas a decade ago, a team of eight people could not find a single animal in four days of searching. The foundation said besides problems caused by cutting down forests, hotter and drier conditions because of global warming had reduced the nutritional value of their staple food, eucalyptus leaves, leading to poor nutrition for them. Koalas, which live in the forests in Australia's east and south, are very fussy about what types of the leaves they eat. Foundation chief Deborah Tabart said: ""The koalas are missing everywhere we look. It's really no tree, no me. If you keep cutting down trees you don't have any koalas."" She is hoping the new figures will persuade the government's Threatened Species Steering Committee (TSSC) to list the koala as threatened. But committee chairman Bob Beeton said a decision was not likely recently and the koala's status as one of the country's favourite animals would not be a factor. ""There's a number of species which are attractive and people have special feelings towards them. We don't consider that,"" Mr Beeton was reported as saying by the AFP agency."

According to the author, when you buy locally-grown foods _ .	The Horn of Plenty is one of the largest natural health food stores within the Greater Hamilton area. We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept. Produce trucked in from far away may lose both taste and nutritional content. Community and home values When you buy direct from a farmer or buy locally-grown foods, you are engaged in a time-honored tradition between a grower and an eater. You also help keep dollars within your community.	['you will contribute to protecting the environment']
What was the author' s attitude to the puppy mill according to the text?	"He may not have an ""S"" across his chest but this dog is most certainly a hero. Harley, who was rescued from a puppy mill four years ago, was named the American Humane Association's 2015 American Hero Dog. Harley, who is missing an eye and has other medical issues from his time at the mill, is now a ""spokes-dog"" against puppy mills. He serves as the adorable furry face of the""Harley to the Rescue""campaign, which raises funds for the National Dog Mill Rescue, according to a press release. The pup was rescued back in 2011 and adopted by Rudi and her husband, Dan. ""It was just four years ago that he was pulled from the cage in the puppy mill and left to die,"" Harley's owner, Rudi, said during the awards show at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles this past weekend, according to Today. com. ""We never would have ever thought he would live this long and make such a difference for so many puppies. "" The dog was one of eight finalists up for the American Hero Dog and was chosen as the winner through public votes. The finalists all won $ 1,500 to be donated to one of American Humane Association' s charity partners, with Harley receiving another $ 5 ,000 to go toward his charity partner, New Leash On Life. According to the release, Harley spent 10 years at the puppy mill, and endured rough treatment there, which led to his many medical issues. He lost his eye as a result of his cage being power-washed with him inside. The dog isn't just the face of his campaign, he also goes on rescue missions and makes public appearances at events and schools to raise awareness for puppy mills. This incredible work is all due to the dog' s fighting spirit. That spirit is allowing him now to be the voice for dogs who cannot speak for themselves and give everybody hope that tomorrow's going to be a better day."	['Unsatisfied.']
Fashion magazines today _ .	Celebrity has become one of the most important representatives of popular culture. Fans used to be crazy about a specific film, but now the public tends to base its consumption on the interest of celebrity attached to any given product. Besides, fashion magazines have almost abandoned the practice of putting models on the cover because they don't sell nearly as well as famous faces. As a result, celebrities have realized their unbelievably powerful market potential, moving from advertising for others' products to developing their own. Celebrity clothing lines aren't a completely new phenomenon, but in the past they were typically aimed at the ordinary consumers, and limited to a few TV actresses. Today they're started by first-class stars whose products enjoy equal fame with some world top brands. The most successful start-ups have been those by celebrities with specific personal style. As celebrities become more and more experienced at the market, they expand their production scale rapidly, covering almost all the products of daily life. However, for every success story, there's a related warning tale of a celebrity who overvalued his consumer appeal. No matter how famous the product's origins is, if it fails to impress consumers with its own qualities it begins to resemble an exercise in self-promotional marketing. And once the initial attention dies down, consumer interest might fade, loyalty returning to tried-and-true labels. Today, celebrities face ever more severe embarrassment. The pop-cultural circle might be bigger than ever, but its rate of turnover has speeded up as well. _ and the same newspaper or magazine that once brought him fame has no problem picking him to pieces when the opportunity appears. Still, the ego's potential for expansion is limitless. Having already achieved great wealth and public recognition, many celebrities see fashion as the next frontier to be conquered. As the saying goes, success and failure always go hand in hand. Their success as designers might last only a short time, but fashion -- like celebrity -- has always been temporary.

In which province have no H7N9 bird flu cases been reported so far?	"HANGZHOU, April 4 (Xinhua) --Another H7N9 bird flu case has been confirmed in east China's Zhejiang Province, the provincial health department said Thursday, bringing the country's total number of cases to 10. The patient is a 64-year-old man from Huzhou City. He became ill on March 29 and was admitted to a hospital in Huzhou on March 31. On Thursday, medical experts confirmed that he was infected with the H7N9 bird flu strain after the provincial center for disease control and prevention said late Wednesday that he tested positive for the virus. An investigation has found that all 55 people who had close contact with the man have not showed any abnormal clinical symptoms, the department said. So far, China has confirmed 10 H7N9 cases -- four in Jiangsu Province, two in Shanghai Municipality, one in Anhui Province and three in Zhejiang. The two patients in Shanghai and one in Zhejiang have died. Health authorities and hospitals in many Chinese provinces have been on high alert for H7N9 cases. In Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi Province, which neighbors Zhejiang, five hospitals have been selected and ordered to be ready to treat H7N9 patients, though no cases have been reported there. China's health authorities have promised transparency and cooperation to the World Health Organization (WHO) in regards to human infections of the new strain of bird flu. On Wednesday afternoon, the National Health and Family Planning Commission distributed prevention and control plans and technique directives to health institutions nationwide. ""So far, the sources of infection have not been clear, but based on past experiences and recent epidemiological studies, the sources could be poultry or the secretion and excrement from poultry,"" according to the plan. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that no human-to-human transmission of H7N9 has been discovered and no epidemiological connection between these cases has been found."

According to the author, the benefit of the invention is _ .	"The Namib Desert in Africa is one of the driest places on earth.With half an inch of rain falling every year,humans call barely survive there for a week with no water.But the Namib beetle does just fine.It collects morning dew that condenses on its back. Inspired by this little creature,27--year--old Edward Linacre,a former student from Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne,Australia,has designed a new""Airdrop"" irrigation system which can pull water from even the driest desert air.His invention won the 2011 James Dyson Award,an international design award.Hopes are high that the system will be able to solve the problems of growing plants on dry land,according to the may Mail. Linacre studied the Namib beetle and found that it had hydrophilic skin on its back,which helped catch water molecules passing in the air.These water molecules accumulated into small drops of liquid water.He realized that as long as the air temperature was low enough,even the driest air contains water molecules that can be extracted . Following this principle,he designed the new system which works by pumping air through a network of underground pipes to cool it to the point at which water condenses.The water is then delivered directly to the roots of plants. According to the research,about 11.5 milliliters of water could be collected from every cubic meter of air in the driest desert.Further development could raise that number even higher . The idea of getting water from the air is not new.However,the Airdrop has certain advantages compared with its competitors.Similar systems often require great amounts of energy because they use refrigeration equipment to lower the temperature.But Airdrop simply uses the temperature difference between the air and the cool earth underground"	['saving great amounts of energy']
In our daily life, which of the following do we use to communicate with each other?	"We use both words and body language to express our thoughts and opinions and to communicate with other people. We can learn about what a person is thinking by watching his or her body language. Words are important, but the way a person stands, folds his or her arms, or moves his or her hands can also give us information about his or her feelings. Just like spoken language, body language varies from culture to culture. Making eye contact --looking directly into someone's eyes -- is in some countries a way to show interest. In other countries, however, eye contact is rude or disrespectful. The gesture for Ok, making a circle with one's thumb and index finger, has different meanings in different cultures. In Japan, someone who sees another person making the gesture will think it means money. In France, a person seeing the same gesture will think it means zero. In Brazil and Germany, however, the gesture is rude. The thumbs-up gesture, meaning ""great"" or ""good job"" in the US is rude in Nigeria, but in Germany and Japan it means the number one. The ""crazy"" gesture, moving the index finger in a circle in front of the ear, means ""you have a phone call"" in Brazil. Even the gesture we use for ""yes"" and ""no"" are different around the world. In many countries, shaking one's head means ""no"", and nodding means ""yes"". In Bulgaria, parts of Greece, and Iran, however, the gestures have the opposite meaning. There are also differences as to how often we touch each other, how close we stand to someone we are talking to, and how we act when we meet or part. In some countries, for example, France and Russia, a visiting friend is greeted with a kiss on the check, in other countries people greet each other with a firm handshake, a loving hug, a bow or a simply a nod of the head. While there are many different interpretations of our body language, some gestures seem to be universal. Pressing one's palms together and resting one's head on the back of one's hand while closing the eyes as if sleeping means ""I am tired."" A good way of saying ""I am full"" is moving the hand in circles over the stomach after a meal. If a person pats his or her stomach before a meal, it usually means "" I'm hungry."" Perhaps the best example of universally understood body language is the smile. A smile can help us get through difficult situation and find friends in a world of strangers. A smile can open doors and tear down walls. It can be used to express almost any emotion. We can use a smile to apologise, to greet someone, to ask for help or to start a conversation. We can smile at ourselves in the mirror to make ourselves feel happier and stronger. And if we are feeling down or lonely, there is nothing better than to see the smiling face of a good friend."

In Carter's judgment, who is monitoring him secretly?	"Former President Jimmy Carter believes U.S central intelligence agency is spying on him -- so much so, he gives up email to avoid government spies. ""You know, I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored,"" Carter told NBC's Andrea Mitchell in an interview broadcast Sunday. ""And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write a letter myself, put it in the post office and mail it. ""I believe if I send an email, it will be monitored,"" Carter continued. The 89-year-old said the National Security Agency and others have abused the argument that gathering intelligence is important to homeland security. ""That has been extremely liberalized and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies,"" Carter said. The 39th president, however, stopped short of criticizing No. 44 over the handling of the N.S.A. scandal , the crisis in Ukraine or anything else. ""I don't have any criticism of him,"" Carter said of Obama. He was asked if the president ever asks him for advice. ""Unfortunately, the answer is no,"" Carter said. ""President Obama doesn't. But previous presidents have called on me and the Carter Center to take action."" Why not Obama? ""That's a hard question for me to answer, you know, with complete directness,"" he said. ""I think the problem was that in dealing with the issue of peace between Israel and Egypt, the Carter Center took a very strong and public position of equal treatment between the Palestinians and the Israelis. And I think this was a sensitive area in which the president didn't want to be involved."""	['CIA']
People don't want to give up their independence because _ .	One of the most striking findings of a recent questionnaire in the UK is that of the people interviewed, one in two believes that it is becoming more difficult to meet someone to start a family with. Why are many people finding it increasingly difficult to start and keep close relationships? Does modern life really make it harder to fall in love? Or are we making it harder for ourselves? It is certainly the case today that nowadays couples benefit in different ways from relationships. Women no longer rely upon partners for economic security or status. A man doesn't expect his wife to be in sole charge of running his household and raising his children. But perhaps the knowledge that we can live perfectly well without a partnership means that it takes much more to persuade people to abandon their independence. In theory, finding a partner should be much simpler these days. Only a few generations ago,your choice of soul mate was limited by geography, social convention and family tradition. Although it was never clear, many marriages were essentially arranged. Now those barriers have been broken down. You can approach a builder or a brain surgeon in any bar in any city on any given evening. When the world is your oyster , you surely have a better chance of finding a pearl. But it seems that the traditions have been replaced by an even tighter restriction:the limitation of choice. The expectations of partners are made greater to an unmanageable degree:good looks, impressive salary, kind to grandmother, and so on. There is no room for error in the first impression. We think that a relationship can be perfect. If it isn't,it is intended to be thrown away. We work to protect ourselves against future heartache and don't put in the hard emotional labor needed to build a strong relationship. Twelve-hour work at the office makes relaxed after-hours dating difficult. The cost of housing and child-raising creates pressure to have a stable income and career before a life partnership.

What gave Gates more confidence to promote table tennis in the United States?	"LONDON---The International Table Tennies Federation(ITTF) plans to work with Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corporation, to promote table tennis in the United States, ITTF President Adham Sharara said. The plan was put forward after Gates came to London to watch the game between US teen player Ariel Hsing and Chinese Li Xiaoxia on Sunday, Sharara told Xinhua in an interview. Sharara didn't disclose the details, but said that Gates offered to help after watching Hsing's match, in which the 16-year-old girl nearly pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Olympic table tennis history, pushing No. 2 seed Li to the limit before losing 4-2 in six tight sets. ""Gates was surprised to see the young American girl played so well. He asked me what he can do to help promote table tennis in the United States. I think we'll work with him. If the United States becomes very strong in table tennis, it's also good for China,"" Sharara said. Sharara said the case is a ""good example"" which shows that ITTF's efforts in promoting the popularity. The ITTF has changed its rules for the London Games, allowing only two players from one nation to enter the singles events. Three players from each National Olympic Committee(NOC) were allowed to enter the singles in previous Games. ""The reason we do this is to help more NOCs to join in our game. If we give more chances to the top countries, someone like Hsing will not come to the Olympic Games. They have no chance. But if we give them the chance, we can see what they can do,"" Sharara said. Sharara said the change increased the pressure on strong teams, like China, Japan, South Korea and Germany. ""But they understand now because they saw other NOCs attending. Some countries before had no chance to play in table tennis, but now they are joining in table tennis."" Other changes made to the Olympic Games include the color of floor (from red to blue) and new table design. ""As far as presentation is concerned, we try to change all the time, especially in the Olympic Games. We hope to give audiences something new, exciting and cool."" Table tennis has long been the strengths of Asia, especially China. Since the sport was introduced into the Olympics in 1988, China has taken 20 of 24 gold medals available. Four years ago in Beijing, it claimed six medals in the men's and women's singles. Talking about the development of table tennis, Sharara said, ""China has the responsibility to promote the sport. Of course, China has done a lot."""	"[""Ariel Hsing's wonderful performance.""]"
In the survey, it is looked to be impolite _ .	So, let's imagine you are walking down the street drinking a box of tea. You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice.

Why was Terry sent to prison? Because he _ .	"It was three o'clock. A man was walking down a high street in the north of England. He was wearing a dark suit and carrying a suitcase. His name was Terry and he and he had lived away from home for twenty years. In fact he was in prison , Terry was feeling totally depressed because everything in his hometown had changed. The park where he used to play was now a car park. The house where he was born had dis appeared and in its place, ironically , was a bank. Terry wanted to have a cup of coffee in the old small restaurant where he used to go with his friend after school, but it had become a fast food restaurant. He entered it, sat down, and asked for a cup of coffee. Then he felt sadder when he thought of what he had seen. While paying for the coffee he found an old ticket in his wallet. It was for a pair of shoes he had taken to be repaired the day before the bank robbery 20 years ago. The shoe repairer was an old man then, so Terry was sure that he must be dead. But when he turned the cor ner of the steet, he couldn't believe his eyes. The shop was still there! And it was the same shoe repairer! He looked about a hundred years old. Terry was so happy! Terry told him that he had lived in Australia for the past twenty years and that he forgot to pick up the shoes before he left England. The shoe repairer disappeared into the back of the shop. After ten minutes he came back. ""Were they dark brown, Italian shoes, size 42?""he asked slowly. ""Yes!nsaid Terry, excitedly. ""I haven't repaired them,""the shoe repairer said slowly. ""You can take them tomorrow afternoon. """	['robbed a bank']

John Jefferson was accused of the following except _ .	"A Brooklyn man who was quarreling with his girlfriend yesterday threw a dog off the balcony of her 23rd-story apartment in TriBeCa, killing it, the police said. The man, John Jefferson, 43, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, has been charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and animal cruelty, the police said.

What's the average life of Chinese people?	"A surprisingly high number of city citizens in China suffer from poor health and many die at an early age. Poor health with no sign of any identified disease, a condition known in China as ""sub health,"" is on the rise. Sub health is marked by general weakness, low energy levels and a poor immune system. A survey held in 16 cities with over 1 million population showed high proportions of urban Chinese have been suffering sub health problems. The numbers are particularly high in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with 75.31, 73.49, and 73.41 percent respectively of residents in poor health, the survey showed. The problem happens mostly among senior and middle-level managers, clerks and other white-collar workers with high education levels, said the website of the Red Cross Society of China. ""The sub health condition, found in most cases among groups of people with a high educational level, will have bad effects on China's long-term development and progress if not dealt timely and properly,"" the website warned. A survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences shows that the average life of Chinese intellectuals is 58 years, 10 years lower than the nation's average. This early death phenomenon may be increasing. Among Chinese people with high education in the 25-59 age group, the death rate for women is as high as 10.4 per cent. For men it is even higher: 16.5 percent. A report published by the China Sub Health Academic Seminar said the country's health is going through a transitional period and many long-term diseases have taken the place of infectious diseases such as SARS and flu as the main cause of death. ""Bad working habits, poor disease prevention knowledge, not enough governmental investment and lack of health education are the main reasons,"" said Yang Xiaoduo, a healthcare expert with a local health association, who said China should race against time seeking measures to solve the sub health problem."

The author advises us to do the following EXCEPT _ .	"Have you ever hated anyone? Well, probably you don't really hate them. But you do get angry the moment you think of them. If you don't get out of the anger, it may turn into bitterness . Bitterness can come about when we can't forgive someone who has hurt us or made us angry. Someone might say or do something that hurts us. But we keep it deep inside instead of working through the anger. Before long, a bitter feeling begins to grow. The bitterness shows when we constantly criticize the one who hurt us. We may think we are hurting that person, but we are really only hurting ourselves. Bitterness is a harmful emotion that affects the whole body. It can lead to serious health problems such as high blood pressure. Bitterness can stop us from concentrating on important things. Instead, we waste time thinking about how we have been hurt. Finally, holding on to bitterness can hurt our relationships with friends and family members. No one enjoys being around an angry, negative person for very long. Author Chuck Swindoll once said, "" Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we respond to it."" That means when someone hurts you, your response is more important than what happened. You can choose to let go of hurt. You can also choose to hold on to hurt, which results in bitterness. If you see bitterness in your life, here are some ways to deal with it. Stop making excuses for it. You may feel you have a fight to be angry. You may even secretly enjoy making the other person look sad. But in the end, bitterness hurts you much more than the other person. Forgive and forget it. The best thing you can do is to forgive and forget. You probably can't totally put the act out of your mind. But you can decide to forgive the other person. Let it go and move on. You'll enjoy better health and peace of mind."	['to hold on to bitterness inside us']

The neighbors came to live next door to the author because _ .	"I hate nosy neighbors and it's very unlucky that I had one for myself. They moved in a couple of months back and although I never felt that they were a strange family, I've always hated the way they get ""too close"" to me, my house, my garden, and even my garbage cans. One day, my neighbors were mowing their lawn . My garbage cans were near their lawn. For some strange reason, I found the wife looking through my garbage cans. I felt angry but since they were from a different culture, I thought that maybe it was ""normal"" from their ideas. That afternoon, the couple knocked on my front door. When I opened, they gave me a plastic bag. Inside were my old daily bills, credit cards and bank statements, and an old birthday card that my old uncle sent. They said that they were returning them to me because these documents contained very private information that may be used by others. I've heard it before. I asked them how those documents can be used by others and they started telling me their very own experience, which forced them to leave their home and move next door to us. The wife told me that she never destroyed the bills. They also had a ""nosy neighbor"" who looked through their garbage cans which they actually thought was pretty strange. Little did they know that this ""nosy neighbor"" was collecting their personal information from their rubbish. Then all their money was taken out from the bank by their neighbor. It was a very painful experience for all of them and they wanted to leave them all behind so they left. I was very thankful. They were not nosy neighbors. They simply didn't want us to experience the same thing that they did."	['their personal documents were used by their former neighbor']

They sat there all the afternoon, eating and smiling, but they said nothing. When it grew dark, the boy decided to leave. But before he had gone more than a few steps, he turned around, ran back to the old woman and gave her a hug. The woman gave him her biggest smile ever. When the boy opened the door of his house, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on his face and asked what had made him so happy. ""I had lunch with Love. She has got the most beautiful smile in the world."" At the same time, the old woman,s son was also surprised at his mother,s pleasure and asked why.

What can we learn about Philo Farnsworth?	"Philo Farnsworth is not a name most people know. But his work changed the way we learn, the way we live, and even the way we think. Philo Farnsworth is responsible for one of the 20thcentury: television. Philo Farnsworth was born in America in 1906. He was interested in science and technology at an early age. When he was twelve years old, he built an electric motor for his family's washing machine. When he was fourteen, he was already giving a lot of thought to electrons . As he was driving the family's horse-drawn plowing machine, he noticed the evenly spaced rows of the potato fields. This sight gave him the idea that electrons could scan an image one row at a time--an idea that was the key to electronic television. By the time he was twenty-one years old, Farnsworth had started his own company and had managed to build the world's first electronic television. It was a very simple device . But after years of hard work, Farnsworth was able to introduce the kind of television we now use. Farnsworth was a great inventor, but lived an unhappy life. He had a legal battle with the company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) over who the real inventor of the TV was. _ , but the government stopped companies from making TVs during the war, so Farnsworth didn't make much money from the invention. When Farnsworth was young, he imagined television as a convenient way for distant audiences to enjoy lectures by famous professors, or entertainment by the best symphonies and ballets. When he was older, television became much more popular, but he was very disappointed in the silly programs on TV. He even told his own son, ""There's nothing on it worthwhile, and we're not going to watch it in this household."""	['He had strong powers of observation.']
The proper title for the passage is _ .	Vitamins are stored in foods we eat. The kids are udner great need of vitamins for growth. As they use their energy in playing, they need lots of vitamins. Children usually choose certain foods above the others and often do not eat those with important nutrients . Sothough the food they are eating is nutritious, it may not always provide all the nutrients the child needs. One nutrient can not balance the shortage of another. Foods like grains, vegetables, fruits and meats should be eaten daily, because different foods in the child's diet can balance against taking too much or too little of any nutrient. Kids grow slower in their childhood than when they were babies or when they develop into adults. Energy output is high, with hard paly perids that include plenty of running, jumping, and testing of new physical skills. So they need a lot of vitamins. Here are some important vitamins and their functions Vitamin D in milk helps your bones. Vitamin A in carrots helps you see at night. Vitamin C in oranges helps your body heal if you get a cut. B vitamins in leafy vegetables helps your body make protein . The children, who are suffering from a sickness called cystic fibrosis, lose vitamin A, D and E. These are main body-building vitamins. Therefore, vitamin supplements may be necessary. Blood tests will telll you whether a child needs vitamin supplements. If babies over nine months of age are receiving whole cow's milk, they'll need a daily vitamin C supplement till their diet provide enough vitamin C. Vitamin D is added to all milks so babies drinking them need no extra vitamin D. Children are greatly in need of vitamin C. If you are 18 years of age or younger, you should get 115 millgrams of vitamin C per day. Those over 19 should get 120 milligrams per day.	['Vitamins for children']

What can we know from the passage?	In our life, there are always some days that will never be forgotten. This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered. I just walked along following my family, with my head held up, my shoulders back and my chest pushed out proudly enjoying the fact that, at that moment in time, on that particular day in life, I was my children's hero.

Which is the best title of the passage?	"There is no such thing as ""the perfect parent"" and everyone has to learn how to educate their children. Parents may be annoyed by their kids and yell at then, but they should be careful not to yell at the children. Children need to be loved and cared for. They need positive encouragement, which will help them believe that they can succeed in their lives. This will also give them opportunities to explore and try out new things. If parents yell at their children, the emotional development of them can be badly affected. Though parents think they are protecting their children at all times, the children will not feel safe when they are yelled at. It can be a very bad experience for children. This can make it difficult for children to enjoy parents' presence if they are being yelled at. A person needs to be a good listener and also should learn to give others a chance to talk. When a child grows up with parents who often yell, this will not happen. When parents often yell, their children will also learn the same thing and they will find it natural not to listen to anyone. The confidence of a child is built up by his or her parents. There is no doubt that yelling will only decrease their confidence level. The words used while yelling can affect them greatly. They will not want to do anything without asking for their parents' permission."	"[""Don't yell at your children""]"

We can learn from the text that _ .	EVERYBODY in this world is different from one another. But do you know that understanding differences can help you better manage your money? As we grow up, we gradually develop a set of our own values or beliefs. These are influenced by society, our family, the education we receive and so on. Once this value system is set up, it's not easy to change later in life. Financial experts say that everyone also has their own belief of how to manage their finances. This is part of our value system and it has a great impact on the way we look after our money. According to our different values, experts put us in three categories. They are: the ant, the cricket and the snail. The ant--works first Just like ants who work heart and soul in summer in order to store food for winter, these people don't care about enjoying the moment. They work very hard and save money they earn so that they can enjoy life when they get old and retire. The ant loves to save but they could make more out of their money if they were willing to invest in some funds and stocks with low risk. The cricket--fun first The cricket wants to enjoy everything now and doesn't think too much about the future. They even borrow money when they really want something. Many young people now belong to this group. These people have little savings. When they get old, they might have problems. They should learn to save and buy insurance. The snail--lives under pressure The snail refers to people who make life difficult for themselves. They take big long-term loans from the bank in order to buy things such as luxury houses. They are happy to take big loans even though they are not sure they can afford it. This can cause problems in the future. They should plan more carefully.

Which is the best title of the story?	"I went home one Saturday afternoon in the autumn of 1993 to get some work done in the garden. While sweeping leaves on the ground, my five-year-old son Nick came over and asked me to write something on a piece of paper to make a sign for him. ""What for?"" I asked. ""I'm going to sell some of my stones, "" he answered. Nick _ stones and had collected many stones from all over. ""I'm busy to do that for you. Go and ask your mum for help."" I said. A short time later, Nick returned with a sign, reading. "" Stones. One Dollar Each"". He took the sign, a small chair and 4 of his best stones and walked to the road in front of our garden. There he put the stones in a line and sat down on the chair. After half an hour, nobody passed by. I walked to him and asked him to go back, but he didn't. Another half hour later, a small car came down the road. I watched as Nick stood up, holding his sign up. A woman rolled down a window and read the sign. I couldn't hear their talk, but I saw the woman turn to the driver and the man reach for his pocket. I sat in the yard, as Nick ran to me. Waving the dollar, he shouted. ""I told you I could sell one stone for a dollar -- if you believe in yourself, you can do anything."""	"[""My son's first sale.""]"
Why did sales go up in Sylvan Goldman's grocery store after he began providing shopping carts?	The modern world is full of useful objects that were invented by someone, from spoons and chopsticks in our kitchens to the Ipads in our handbags. Each invention is an example of the creative power of the human mind. Where do inventors get their inspirations ? The inspiration behind each of these inventions varies. Take the shopping cart as an example. Sylvan Goldman was a grocery store owner. Like most businessmen, he wished that his customers would buy more so that he could make more money. He knew what if they could carry more goods easily as they were shopping, when his sales would go up. While thinking about the problem one night, he had an idea. Working with a local handyman named Fred Young, he designed the first shopping cart. Today, retailers who use shopping carts sell more goods and make more profits. Nature has also inspired inventors throughout history. This is what happened to George de Mestral one day. While hunting with his dog in the Swiss Alps, he noticed how the burs of certain plants stuck to his clothing and to his dog' s fur. After examining them under a microscope, he found they had tiny hooks that could easily stick to the fibers of clothing or animal hide. For the next ten years, George de Mestral searched for the hest way to produce his idea. The result of his original inspiration was Velcro, which is used in many modem objects, including sportswear, shoes, automobiles, and even space suits. These examples show us that there are at least two possible inspirations for human creativity in the world of inventions -- profit and nature. No doubt, the future will continue to breathe new life into the economies of the world with fresh ideas and inventions. How many of their creations will be inspired by natural phenomena? The world's problems require creativity and we can expect best solutions from future generations.	['Because customers were able to carry more items when shopping.']
What does the writer intend to tell us through the passage?	"When we are unfamiliar with something,we may feel nervous and fearful.The assistance of others is a good way to help us pull through. I write for a big newspaper, and I wanted to write a story about parachute jumping.To make it a realistic as well as exciting story,I decided that I first had to make a jump myself. Unfortunately,I am not good at any sports of any kind,let alone parachute jumping. My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand.He took me to a ground school.The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first drop from an airplane For this,I had to wait until the following morning. The next morning,after a hurried,anxious breakfast,I was taken to the airfield.There,two heavy parachutes were put on my back,and an orange helmet was pushed down onto my head.Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped slowly on the runway. Once on board,the plane was soon climbing.I began to feel nervous.As we reached one thousand metres,Harry,my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane.The line was to pull my parachute open after I jumped. ""Get ready, Henry,""Harry said.I moved carefully to the door.I wanted to cry,""No,no,no!""But no word came. ""Jump!""Harry called loudly.""Jump!"" To my surprise,kicking like a frog I did jump.Away from the plane,and down,down I fell,arms stretched.It worked! The air seemed to hold me up.All at once I was very happy. Then I felt a quick pull.My big parachute had opened! It was the best surprise I ever had. I looked down.There were rivers,trees,fields and houses.I heard the soft sound of the air This was fun !"	['With the help of others, we can get over fear and nervousness.']
What is the main idea of this passage?	"A British company has proposed releasing genetically modified(GM) diamondback moths, which would reduce the population of the vegetable-eating insects. Males carrying a deadly gene would be released, which would cause their young ones to die immediately. Then the fall in their numbers could help increase production for farmers. Oxitec, the company which came up with the idea, hopes to begin trials next year, but some groups are saying no to them,, saying the untested technology could threaten wildlife and human health. ""Mass releases of GM insects into the British countryside would be impossible to recall if anything went wrong. Changing one part of an ecosystem can have knock-on-effects on others in ways that are poorly understood. This could include an increase in different types of pests. Wildlife that feeds on insects could be impaired if there are changes to their food supply,"" said Dr Helen Wallace, the director of Gene-Watch UK. Hadyn Parry, Oxitec's chief executive, said that there was demand from farmers for the technology and that using GM insects to kill the pests that feed on food crops is better for the environment than chemical sprays. The firm is developing a number of GM insects that would be used in Britain and around the world to protect crops and fight disease in humans. Oxitec has contacted the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to ask what controls should be put in place around GM moth trials. A spokesman said that while its officials and advisers have discussed Oxitec's plans, there has not been a formal application for a trial. As a result, the department has not reached a view on whether it should go ahead."	['GM moths could be released to fight crop pests.']
How did the author first react to father's suggestion?	"The sound of the rain hitting the windows wakes me up and it sounds just exactly as it did 15 years ago, which reminded me of my girlhood. It was my second day of school and it was raining heavily. I could not resist the habit I had at home, so I fell asleep right at my desk. I woke up to find myself not in the classroom but carried on Dad's back. We were halfway home. It was the last time I felt close to him. After that, he never carried me or hugged me as other fathers did to their children. I was not bothered much by this thought. I was proud of it, for I felt independent and ""grown up."" However, there were times when I felt depressed by not having sought comfort from him. One day, I was writing Chinese characters as homework. I hated doing this more than anything. Dad came and stood behind me for a moment, watching me scratching the paper. Then he said, ""This kind of writing needs patience. Your writing is not strong enough. Press harder."" I follow his advice for the next two words, but as I could see little improvement, I followed my own method----the fast way. His advice did not improve my writing but our relationship. As I grew older, I found out that he had finished his schooling in Grade 6, which was the highest grade in the town then, so he was considered to be a scholar. People used to ask him to write something to put on the walls, but he never felt very useful. He often said to me, ""As you can see, this family is going to count on you. We are useless to improve you anything for your future.You have to get an education to change the life for yourself."" As a result of his expectation, I have made it through high school and through college."	['She accepted it.']

The Internet was widely used in the _ .	"We are all busy talking about and using the Internet ,but how many of us know about the history of the Internet? Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s.At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer networks didn' t work well .If one computer in the network broke down ,then the whole network stopped. So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers.If part of the network was not working ,information could be sent through another part.In this way the computer network system would keep on working all the time.At first,the Internet was only used by the government ,but,in the early 1970s, universities,hospitals and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still expensive and the Internet was difficult to use.By the start of the 1990s,computers become cheaper and easier to use.Scientists had also developed software that made ""surfing "" the Internet more convenient . Today it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among students. The Internet has now become one of the most important parts of people' s life."	['1990s']

Which is the best title for this passage?	"We all enjoy the colors of autumn leaves. Did you ever wonder how and why a fall leaf changes color? Where do the yellows and oranges come from? To answer those questions, we first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. They take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose, which is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis, which means "" putting together with light. "" A chemical called chlorophyll helps make photosynthesis happen. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how the trees ""know"" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. The trees will rest, and live off the food they stored during summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors. Small a-mounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along. Covered up by the green chlorophyll, we just can't see them in summer. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall. In some trees, like maples, glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn cause the leaves turn this glucose into a red color. The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves. It is the combination of all these things that make the beautiful colors we enjoy in the fall."	['Mysteries of tree colors']
From the passage we can learn that Michael Schumacher _ .	"On 23rd December, 2013, Michael Schumacher -- the famous Formula-One race car driver -- received serious brain injuries after hitting his head on a rock while downhill skiing with his son. The accident happened during a family holiday in the French Alps. Although he was wearing a helmet, which broke apart on impact, the F1 celebrity was moving at speeds of up to 62 mph and skiing outside the off-piste safety demarcations . Doctors reported that he would have died on impact if he hadn't been wearing a helmet. He has been in a coma since arriving at a nearby hospital where he was airlifted to from the site of the accident. Michael Schumacher grew up in frugal conditions and started what would become his remarkable professional career when his working class father -- a bricklayer -- built him a _ from where he started participating in competitions. He started his adult career racing for Formula Ford in 1988 and later raced for Formula One Ford, Ferrari, and Mercedes AMG. He holds numerous F1 world records including most race victories, fastest laps, and most races won in a single season. According to the Formula One website, he is ""statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen"". Also notable are his contributions to charity, during the peak of his career he has given away more than 50 million Euros to a variety of charity organizations, most to help children around the world. Millions of Europeans and other fans around the world are holding their breath and waiting for information about his hopeful recovery. We wish him and his family the best."

Which of the following statements would the author agree with?	"Exchanging music over the Internet is fun and easy. Better yet, it's free, which means you don't have to pay for any more expensive music CDs. Several online file-sharing services make it easy for music lovers to exchange their favorite tunes with one another. However, this sharing of music -- a form of music piracy -- is doing harm to the music industry. Industry experts estimate that US$4.3 billion in worldwide sales was lost to music piracy last year. These lost profits could force record companies to stop producing the music of many popular artists. That would hurt both musicians and music fans alike. Music producers are puzzled about how to fight music piracy. Their efforts to fight piracy using the law have had only limited success. The music industry did win a legal victory against Napster, a famous music website. The courts ordered Napster to stop giving away copyrighted music from their site. But a number of other music-sharing networks have sprung up in its place. These new networks are made up of thousands, or even millions, of individuals. Unlike Napster, there's no one company controlling the distribution of music over each network. So it's nearly impossible to stop the illegal activities. Now people in the music industry have decided that "" if you can't beat them, join them."" They've begun to offer legal alternatives to online music piracy. Major music producers have given companies like Apple Computer permission to sell their music online. Apple's iTune Music Store allows computer users to legally download any song for 99 cents. Will these new measures save the music industry from piracy? That depends on whether music fans are willing to pay 99 cents fro a song that they can download illegally for free. Unfortunately, many people believe music should be free. The music industry, however, hopes to persuade these music fans to change their tune."

In Misbah's childhood, _ .	Love, success, happiness, family and freedom--how important are these values to you? Here is one interview which explores the fundamental questions in life. Question: Could you introduce yourself first? Answer: My name is Misbah, 27 years old. I was born in a war-torn area. Right now I'm a web designer. Q: What are your great memories? A: My parents used to take us to hunt birds, climb trees, and play in the fields. For me it was like a holiday because we were going to have fun all day long. Those are my great memories. Q: Does your childhood mean a lot to you? A: Yes. As life was very hard, I used to work to help bring money in for the family. I spent my childhood working, with responsibilities beyond my age. However, it taught me to deal with problems all alone. I learnt to be independent. Q: What changes would you like to make in your life? A: If I could change something in my life, I'd change it so that my childhood could have taken place in another area. I would have loved to live with my family in freedom. Who cares whether we have much money, or whether we have a beautiful house? It doesn't matter as long as I can live with my family and we are safe. Q: How do your get along with your parents? A: My parents supported me until I came of age. I want to give back what I've got. That's our way. But I am working in another city. My only contact with my parents now is through the phone, but I hate using it. It filters out your emotion and leaves your voice only. My deepest feelings should be passed through sight, hearing and touch.	['he was fond of getting close to nature']
How did people get to know the couple's problem?	It was a winter morning,just a couple of weeks before Christmas of 2005. While most people were warming up their cars,Trevor,my husband,had to get up early to ride his bike four kilometers away from home to work. On arrival,he parked his bike outside the back door as he usually does. After putting in 10 hours of labor, he returned to find his bike gone. The bike,a black Kona 18 Speed,was our only transport. Trevor used it to get to work,putting in 60-hour weeks to support his young family. And the bike was also used to get foods, saving us from having to walk along long distances from where we live. I was so sad that someone would steal our bike that I wrote to the newspaper and told them our story. Shortly after that,several people in our area offered to help. One wonderful stranger even bought a bike,then called my husband to pick it up. Once again my husband had a way to get to and from his job. It really is an honor that a complete stranger would go out of their way for someone they have never met before. People say that a smile can be passed from one person to another,but acts of kindness from strangers are even more so. This experience has had a spreading effect in our lives because it made us believe more in the beauty of humanity as a whole. And it has influenced us to be more mindful of ways we,too,can share with others. No matter how big or how small,an act of kindness shows that someone cares. And the results can last forever.

When I got to the hospital, I hurriedly looked for his hospital room. I found him in a semi-conscious state . On my knees, I said softly, ""Hello, Grandpa."" Still feeling shy, I decided not to leave his bedside without letting him know. While I asked about how he was, he told me, ""I'll be fine, Henry."" although we both knew that wasn't true. Then he asked me with a smile how I was doing. Hearing what my grandpa said, I was much moved. I made the decision that I had to show my _ for him. As I found all the courage I had, I hold his hand tightly. I cried out, ""Grandpa. I just want to let you know how much I love you. I hope you already know that yet I just want to make sure."" By this time, tears were rolling down my face. All those years of love that I had shut and not let him know, became free. Smilingly, he said, ""I know. Thank you for telling me that. All I have on this planet is my family and my love for them. If there is anything I could ask of you, I want you to be good to your family, your mother, your father, and your brother. That's all I want of you."" What I learned that day changed my whole life. From then on, I began telling people how much I love them, care for them, and respect them. I get in touch with, for example, my babysitter, my barber, to show my appreciation. I go down into the city once a week and serve pizza to the homeless. I wake up every morning and list everything I'm thankful to in my life."	['at noon']

What is the impression of the author about the people in hutong?	"I first visited hutong as part of a tourist group several years ago. We rode on a trishaw with a guide explaining the history, architecture and lifestyle of the local inhabitants. Having visited the ""must-sees"" of Beijing, like the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Drum Tower and the Summer Palace, going into the hutong home of some famous ancient families gave the ""Beijing experience"" a human element. My curiosity has sharpened over the years from reading about them at every opportunity. During the preparation for the Olympics, I was eager to learn that some siheyuan courtyards in hutong were turned into accommodations for visitors. I wished to stay in one someday. Preparing for a recent trip to the capital, I eagerly sought one out. On my limited teacher's salary, I settled on an affordable option, though I looked longingly at the more courtyard accommodations. As usual, by not being able to go upmarket, I ended up having something closer to a true experience. A real family still lives in the courtyard, which is closer to the original. The rooms all opened into the central courtyard. Flowers were blooming, beans and peas were climbing up the bamboo fence, and the cat was napping in the sun. Every day after exploring the city, I'd hurry back to the hutong, take a quick shower and join the cat - snoozing in a bamboo-made chair with a book ready nearby. As the other guests came back we'd greet one another. There was a mother and young daughter from France, a guy from Canada, a mother and teenage daughter from the Netherlands, a teacher from England and several guests from various parts of China. Coming and going through the narrow alleys of the hutong, the residents would smile and give cheery ""ni hao"" (hello). Laughing children were playing under the watchful eyes of the neighbors. I felt right at home in this friendly neighborhood."	['They are living together in harmony.']

I truly appreciate beingable to drop what I'm doing to attend kids or go shopping, but there's a side to it we don't often talk about, the hard side. No one wants to believe people like me, working from home, have anything tocomplain about. Really, I'm not going to complain, but I do want to share a few things about telecommuting that few home-based people want to tell you, because working from home doesn't look so wonderful. One of the reasons I love my job is the flexibility . I know that I can volunteer for school projects,meet friends for lunch and work out for an hour as long as I get my work done. But did you know telecommuters have to make up the time if they wish to fill their days with fun items? Sowhile my husband and kids are watching a movie, I'm working until midnight. Besides, when youwork from home, you're held to your phone and Skype in case someone wants to talk toyou during business hours. So it's not so easy to be flexible!

The passage is most likely written to _ .	"Allow me to introduce you to Terry, a window salesman from England. If I could take you back about 20 years, you'd know Terry as a complete green hand, who was wet behind the ears in just about everything he attempted. _ You know, the kind who could sell snow to Eskimos. Terry's boss decided to send him out on a practical field trip on his first day. So off he went, but he was extremely nervous. With his hands and his knees shaking, he approached the front door and knocked at is. And old woman appeared. After dozens of cups of tea and pieces of biscuits, the woman signed a contract and purchased over $7,000 worth of windows. The woman had already talked with 6 excellent salesmen that week, all of whom offered her cheaper ones! That's right---Terry's price was the most expensive and he was also the most inexperienced salesman there ever was. So, what happened then? Here comes the secret. The woman said she liked the young lad more than the others. That's all there was to it. She didn't care about the extra expense. Even the other salesmen couldn't persuade her to pay less than this young lad was asking for. The truth is that the young lad left on the woman the first impression that shone brighter than any of the salesman's talk. First impressions count, not the sales techniques, not the low prices. The actual ""personality"" the kid honestly gave was all that was required. If you market your own products and services, consider what impression you are giving to others. If you appeal to them, then you've already done half of the work. If this means redesigning your presentation, then so be it. If this means going out of your way to be polite, helpful and giving the best possible shopping experience to your customers, the so be it."	['new salesmen']
If the inspector had opened the oven door, he would have seen _ .	"Have your parents ever inspected your room to see if you cleaned it properly? Imagine having your entire houses, garage, and yard inspected at any time -- with no warning. Inspections were a regular part of lighthouse living, and a keeper's reputation depended on results. A few times each year, an inspector arrived to look over the entire light station. The inspections were supposed to be a surprise, but keeper sometimes had advance notice. Once lighthouses had telephones, keepers would call each other to warn that the inspector was approaching. After boats began flying special flags noting the inspector aboard, the keeper's family made it a game to see who could notice the boat first. As soon as someone spotted the boat, everyone would do last-minute tidying and change into fancy clothes. The keeper then scurried to put on his dress uniform and cap. Children of keepers remember inspectors wearing white gloves to run their fingers over door frames and windowsills looking for dust. Despite the serious nature of inspections, they resulted in some funny moments. Betty Byrnes remembered when her mother did not have time to wash all the dishes before an inspection. At the time, people did not have dishwashers in their homes. In an effort to clean up quickly, Mrs. Byrnes tossed all the dishes into a big bread pan, covered them with a cloth and stuck them in the oven. If the inspector opened the oven door, it would look like bread was baking. he never did. One day, Glenn Furst's mother put oil on the kitchen floor just before the inspector entered their house. Like floor wax, the oil made the floors shiny and helped protect the wood. This time, though, she used a little too much oil. When the inspector extended his hand to greet Glenn's mother, he slipped on the freshly oiled surface. ""He came across that floor waving his arms like a young bird attempting its first flight,"" Glenn late wrote. After he steadied himself, he shook Glenn's mother's hand, and the inspection continued as though nothing had happened."	['a cloth covering something']
What caused milk prices in California to increase?	The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing.	['Being short of rain.']
What can be the best title for the text?	"I regularly train at a local boxing gym and I'm lucky enough to meet an amazing man, Adrian Charter. Adrian comes to the gym to train, just like me. The difference is, I'm 31 years old, and Adrian is 72! I watched Adrian as he was training, early on a Sunday morning, and he was hitting the punching bag harder and quicker than most men in their twenties would. Adrian was a former boxer whose last professional fight was in 1972. Even though he has stopped competing as a boxer, his discipline still makes him stick to a training rule. It simply amazed me as to how a 72-year-old man could train so hard. Believe me, boxing is one of the most difficult sports on the earth, needing much patience,skill, and effort. What surprised me even more was that a few days earlier he did some running. He ran 9 kilometers. He does this on a regular basis. For me, I can run 5 kilometers at most. When I questioned him about how he kept such discipline, he calmly replied, ""It is all in my mind."" I thought about it for a moment. If discipline can push a 72-year-old man to train so hard and enjoy it, could I imagine how discipline could serve every single human being on the earth? Right at this point, as you read this story, please pause and ask yourself, ""What is my level of discipline?""

Which work needs a lot of time to do?	My first visit to Angkor Wat was in 1980. The country had been at war for many years and _ and falling to pieces. Plants were growing out of the roofs, and trees were growing in the courtyards. Today, the temple is the scene of a busy repair program. A team of 15 Indian experts are organizing a workforce of 400 Cambodians, most of them women, who are cleaning, repairing and rebuilding parts of this temple. As I walked through the courtyards, I noticed the Cambodian women devote hours to cleaning carefully a tiny area of stone. Boards are laid down to protect the precious painted stones while the repair work is going on. There are very few machines and little heavy equipment. Workers carry building materials in buckets at the end of long poles. Piles of stones lie in a corner of the courtyard, waiting to be replaced. The work of cleaning the stones is watched over by three Indian chemists. It is a very slow task. First they clean the stones with brushes using buckets of a weak chemical. Then gaps between the stones are filled in. Finally another material is painted onto the stones which will protect them from water forever. Work starts every day at 7 a. m. and goes on until late afternoon six days a week, with a break at midday. Evening is the best time to visit the temple, after the tour groups have left. As the sun sinks lower, shadows spread across the courtyard. After sunset, the sky turns pink. The grey stone towers take on a golden color before turning pink. Nowhere else in the world can there be such a quiet, beautiful place.	['To clean the stones.']

Lead researcher Omri Gillath said the judgments were based on the style,cost,color and condition of someone's shoes.In the study,63 University of Kansas researchers looked at pictures showing 208 different pairs of shoes worn by the study's participants.Volunteers in the study were photographed in their most commonly worn shoes,and then filled out a personality questionnaire. Some of the results were expected:People with higher incomes most commonly wore expensive shoes,and flashier shoes were typically worn by outgoing people.However,some of the more specific results are strange enough.For example,""practical and functional'' shoes were generally worn by more ""pleasant"" people,while ankle boots were more linked with ''aggressive'' personalities.The strangest of all may be that those who wore' 'uncomfortable looking"" shoes tend to have ""calm"" personalities.And if you have several pairs of new shoes or take extreme care of them,you may suffer from ""attachment anxiety"",spending lots of time worrying about what other people think of your appearance.There was even a political calculation in the mix with more liberal types wearing ""shabbier and less expensive"" shoes. The researchers noted that some people will choose shoe styles to mask their actual personalities,but researchers noted that volunteers were also likely to be unaware that their footwear choices were showing the deep side of their personalities."

Thank God the kids weren't with me, because the house was 5 feet deep in water. We lost everything downstairs. And the plaster had to be torn off the walls, ceilings pulled down. At first we tried to push on through. We didn't want to move the children out of home, so we camped upstairs. we put a sheet of plastic across the floor to protect us from the damp. But after three months, we felt very sick, so we moved to a wooden house in a park. The house was small, but at first we were all just delighted to be in a new place. Unfortunately, things took longer than expected and we were there for 10 months. The life there was inconvenient. What surprised me most was how much I missed being part of a community .We had lived in a friendly village with good neighbours, and I'd never thought how much I'd miss that. Although-our situation was very bad, it's difficult to feel too sorry for yourself when you look at what's happening elsewhere. I watched a news report about floods in Northern India and thought , ""We didn't have a straw hut that was swept away , and our house is still sanding . We're lucky ."" We moved back home in August. With December coming, there's reconstruction work to be done, so it's difficult to prepare for Christmas.

According to the passage, what items do scientists often use to learn more about the past?	"Anthropologists are scientists that study people who often lived hundreds or even thousands of years ago. Items those men, women, and children left behind when they died --- everything from clothing to jewelry and tools --- tell anthropologists a lot. And sometimes even their words survive. Experts believe that a discovery in Mexico is the oldest example of writing ever found in the Americas. The people who created it probably lived 3,000 years ago, long before Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World. Workers digging in a rock mine happened to notice a stone block with marks carved onto its surface. They found the large piece of stone near the city of Cascajal, Mexico, which was once the capital of an ancient people called the Ohmec. ""There are signs on the block that seem to show objects used by the Olmec during their religious ceremonies,"" says Dr. Stephen Houston, of Brown University in the USA. ""There is a sign that looks very similar to a knife and another that looks like the chair of a King,"" he explains. Houston, an expert on the writing systems of ancient cultures, says the discovery is exciting because ""it makes clear that the Olmec could read and write. It is like hearing voices from the past."" But experts don't know exactly what the writing says. Finding other examples of Olmec writing could help decipher the puzzle. ""We could have whole sets of ancient writing which will basically make ancient people speak to us directly,"" says Houston. ""There are many puzzles to be solved, and this is just one of them."""

Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?	"Most people agree that honesty is a good thing. But does Mother Nature agree? Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior? Animal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive. Many kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the ""hurt"" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest. Another kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else. Birds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them. _ After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other. When the winning chimp puts out its hand, too, the chimps are friendly again. But an animal expert once saw a losing chimp take the winner's hand and start fighting again. Chimps are sneaky in other ways, too. When chimps find food that they love, such as bananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them, and they don't need to share their food. As children, many of us learn the saying ""You can't fool Mother Nature."" But maybe you can't trust her, either."	['Do animals lie?']

I'm very fortunate--mine isn't. I pretty much live a regular life, except for people asking me about it all the time, which can get annoying sometimes. When I was about 4 years old, I asked my mom why there weren't any characters with birthmarks in the books she would read to me. When we went to the library, we realized there weren't any available for little kids. Worse than that, the books available to older kids and adults described characters with birthmarks as unattractive. So I decided to write my own. I based the story on all the real things that happened in my life. But instead of people, the characters in the book are real animals from the Galapagos Islands, including red-footed booby birds . I picked a booby bird as the main character because the birds have red feet due to a vascular condition, similar to a human birthmark! It was really tough to get my book published. It took a long time because a lot of publishers refused to publish it. They would say there wasn't a big enough market for a book about birthmarks. But my mom never gave up trying to help make my dream come true. And in 2005, she finally took her own money and self-published ""Buddy Booby's Birthmark"". After it was published, I got letters from readers all over the world. They all shared their stories and thanked me for sharing mine. Teachers wrote to tell me that my book changed the way classmates treated each other and that my book was helping kids to accept and appreciate their differences. Then, as more teachers started reading my book, I created a free global reading event, the ""International Buddy Booby's Birthmark Read--Along for Tolerance and Awareness."""

62. To improve their reading ability, people should _ .	Some people have the feeling that nothing can be done about their poor reading ability. They feel hopeless about it. Can you learn to read better, or must you agree that nothing can be done about it? To be sure, people are different. You cannot expect to do everything as well as certain other people do. If all the students in a class tried out for basketball, some would be very good players; others would be very poor; . But even the very poor players can become much better players if they are guided in the right way, and with plenty of practice. It is the same with reading. Some seem to enjoy reading and to read well without any special help. Others find reading a slow and tiring job. In between, there are all degrees of reading ability. Many experiments have shown that just about every poor reader can improve his reading ability. In these experiments, the poor readers were given tests of reading ability. After some of the causes of their reading were discovered, they were given special instruction and practice in reading. After a few months, another test of the same kind was given. In nearly all cases, these people had raised their reading scores.	['have special help and practice']

The home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job? The answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges. One such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert.

When you do, ""learning bursts right open,"" says Evelyn Vuko, a longtime teacher who writes an education column called ""Teacher Says"" for the Washington Post newspaper. In fact, kids who get along with their teachers not only learn more, but they're also more comfortable asking questions and getting extra help. This makes it easier to understand new material and do the best on tests. When you have this kind of relationship with a teacher, he or she can be someone to turn to when you have problems, such as problems with learning, school issues, or bullying. As a kid in elementary or middle school, you're at a wonderful stage in your life. You're like a sponge , able to take in lots of new and exciting information. On top of that, you're able to think about all this information in new ways. Remember teachers are people too, and they feel great if you're open to what they're teaching you. That's why they wanted to be teachers in the first place--to teach! In every school, kids will say certain teachers are tough. In fact, in most cases, your teacher wants to help you. And a teacher who's called tough may be someone who feels strongly about getting his or her job done -- teaching you what you are supposed to learn."	['Form a good relationship with.']
What is an assisted living center?	While assisted living centers have been available in the United States for many years, the growth and availability of assisted living has had a dramatic increase since the early 1990s. An assisted living center is a residential alternative that promotes maximum independence for each resident through a combination of supportive services and assistance. The definition of assisted living from one state to another may vary and so will the cost and types of services. Assisted living centers vary in size, style and the optional services they may offer. Small family style living or the larger complex of units can be found in the United States. Some facilities are operated by nonprofit organizations, while others are _ . In addition, some facilities may be co-located or affiliated with a hospital or nursing facility. An assisted living center is any institution, rest home, boarding home, place, building or agency that is maintained and operated to provide personal care and services which meet some need beyond basic provision of food, shelter and laundry in a free standing, physically separate facility which is not otherwise required to be licensed. In general terms, an assisted living center is required to provide assistance with daily living activities, including eating, bathing, dressing and personal hygiene; three meals a day; supervision (,) of self-administration of medications; laundry service including personal laundry, housekeeping, and 24-hour staffing.

What is the author's main attitude towards universities in the present?	"The structure and workings of the university are ever changing. The university of the past is not like the university of the present and the university of the present will not be like the university of the future. This ""adaptation"" to the times is what can make some universities great or make some universities among the worst in the nation. In the past the university was very set in their ways. They did things the way they wanted them done. They paid no attention to the rest of the society and the way the ones paying the bills wanted them done. In the past the professors would lecture endlessly to the students, which often left the students bored and with no idea what was really said to them in the lecture. This is no way to try and teach students; students need interaction with the professors that are paid to teach them. As Paulo Freire believed there needs to be communication between the students and the professors and the class should not be totally memorization. This is the way that things were done in the past. In the present many universities have either changed or are changing the way that they run their universities. The universities now are taking on many of the modern educational beliefs in order to make changes in the teaching methods. Universities are breaking down many of the divides between majors that they offer. By breaking these barriers the universities are becoming less specialized and more diverse. This goes along with the ideas of Berry who believes that the schools are over-specialized and that the universities are now just machines that are merely meant to produce workers. In the past few years the colleges have been lowering the standards of admission, which in turn lowers the standards of all the schools below the college level. The universities are now on the right track by increasing the standards of admission into their colleges."	['Positive.']
Critics of the plan argued that _ .	"Tens of thousands of theatre tickets will be given away to young people next year as part of a government campaign to inspire a lifelong love for theatre. The plan to offer free seats to people aged between 18 to 26--funded with PS2.5 million of taxpayers' money--was announced yesterday by Andy Burnham, the Culture Secretary. It received a cautious welcome from some in the arts world, who expressed concern that the tickets may not reach the most underprivileged. The plan comes as West End theatres are enjoying record audiences, thanks largely to musicals teaming up with television talent shows. Attendances reached. 13.6 million in 2007, up 10 percent on 2006, itself a record year. Total sales were up 18 percent on 2006 to almost PS470 million. One theatre source criticised the Government's priorities in funding free tickets when pensioners were struggling to buy food and fuel, saying: ""I don't know why the Government's wasting money on this. The Yong Vic, as reported today, offers excellent performances at cheap prices."" There was praise for the Government's plan from Dominic Cooke of the Royal Court Theatre, who said: ""I support any move to get young people into theatre, and especially one that aims to do it all over England, not just in London."" Ninety-five publicly funded theatres could apply for funding under the two-year plan. In return, they will offer free tickets on at least one day each week to 18 to 26-year-olds, first-come, first-served. It is likely to be on Mondays, traditionally a quiet night for the theatre. Mr. Burnham said: ""A young person attending the theatre can find it an exciting experience, and be inspired to explore a new world. But sometimes people miss out on it because they fear it's 'not for them'. It's time to change this perception."" Jeremy Hunt, the Shadow Culture Secretary, said: ""The real issue is not getting enthusiastic children into the theatre, but improving arts education so that more young people want to go in the first place. For too many children theatres are a no-go area."""	['it would be a waste of money']
This passage mainly talks about the importance of _ .	Have you ever picked a job based on the fact that you were good at it but later found it made you feel very uncomfortable over time? When you select your career, there's whole lot more to it than assessing your skills and matching them with a particular position. If you ignore your personality, it will hurt you long-term regardless of your skills or the job's pay. There are several areas of your personality that you need to consider to help you find a good job. Here are a few of those main areas: 1) Do you prefer working alone or with other people? There are isolating jobs that will drive an outgoing person crazy and also interactive jobs that will make a shy person uneasy. Most people are not extremes in either direction but do have a tendency that they prefer. There are also positions that are sometimes a combination of the two, which may be best for someone in the middle who adapts easily to either situation. 2) How do you handle change? Most jobs these days have some elements of change to them, but some are more than others. If you need stability in your life, you may need a job where the changes don't happen so often. Other people would be bored of the same daily routine. 3) Do you enjoy working with computers? I do see this as a kind of personality characteristic. There are people who are happy to spend more than 40 hours a week on a computer, while there are others who need a lot of human interaction throughout the day. Again, these are extremes and you'll likely find a lot of positions somewhere in the middle as well. 4) What type of work environment do you enjoy? This can range from being in a large building with a lot of people you won't know immediately to a smaller setting where you'll get to know almost all the people there fairly quickly. 5) How do you like to get paid? Some people are motivated by the pay they get, while others feel too stressed to be like that. The variety of payment designs in the sales industry is a typical example for this. Anyway, these are a great starting point for you. I've seen it over and over again with people that they make more money over time when they do something they love. It may take you a little longer, but making a move to do what you have a passion for can change the course of your life for the better.	['personalities']
What's cosplay according to the passage?	"Beijing (Xinhua): When she appeared on stage, singing a Japanese song, hundreds of excited teenagers crowded around shouting, ""Curarpikt !Its Curarpikt!"" At the Beijing Comic and Animation Expo last week, that's exactly who Shi Jia was. The Senior 1 girl was cosplaying ""Curarpikt"", a character from the popular Japanese comic book Hunter X Hunter (<<>> ) by Yoshihiro Togashi. ""I cosplay Curarpikt because I like him,"" said the pretty 15-year-old girl. ""I'm moved by his sad story and I'm attracted by his courage and personality."" In the adventure comic story, Curarpikt, a handsome and kind-hearted boy, struggles to become a hunter so he can capture the people who killed his tribe. Shi has read all the comic books and is a big fan of the animated series of Hunter X Hunter. Then last year she saw a real ""Curarpikt"" in a cosplay show. ""I had watched cosplay shows before but only for fun,"" she explained. ""It's really exciting to see young people wearing the make up and costumes of characters that you've read about and are familiar with."" ""But that time I just fell in love with cosplaying, probably because I like Curarpikt so much. I thought I could play the character better, so I decided to have a go."" Shi bought some cloth and asked a tailor to make a Curarpikt costume for her. She was delighted to find out there was a cosplay show in Beijing in October. ""It's a great way to spend the national holiday. Posing on the stage for all the comic book fans, I knew I was doing something I had always wanted to do,"" she said. But she never talks about her hobby with her parents. ""They think it will distract me from my studies. I don't want to upset them, that's my secret hobby,"" she said. ""It's also why I don't dye my hair for cosplaying like all the others."""	['When cosplaying, comic fans wear costumes and pretend to be their favourite comic characters.']
The main idea of the news report is to tell us _ .	BEIJING -- China's efforts to develop an aircraft carrier program will not change the defensive nature of its defense policy, said a signed commentary published in Friday's PLA Daily newspaper, the voice of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). After China officially confirmed that it is planning an aircraft carrier program by announcing a refitting project of an imported aircraft carrier for the purposes of scientific research and training, some voices overseas expressed concern that China's possession of an aircraft carrier could upset the regional and global strategic balance. At present, China is only making use of an old aircraft carrier platform for scientific research, experiments and training, and it still will take a long time before the country actually has an operational carrier, said the commentary signed by Peng Guangqian. Even when China has a carrier, it will stick to the defensive nature of its defense policy, the commentary said, adding that China has plenty of reasons and legitimacy to have an aircraft carrier. China is currently the only country without an operational aircraft carrier among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Other countries, including Spain, Italy, India, Brazil and Thailand also have carriers. This situation does not _ China's international status, the commentary said. Another article said a carrier will help promote Chinese citizens' awareness of maritime affairs, increase the capability to safeguard the country's maritime interests as well as the capability to participate in international maritime joint operations, such as salvage, counterterrorism and piracy crackdowns, it said.

What would be the best title for the passage?	"It was a late Wednesday night when the dreading phone call reached our home. I sat up, somehow terrified, so I could hear the phone call better. To my surprise, I heard my mom burst into tears. ""Get the car, Dean! Andrea has been in a car accident."" _ We got to the hospital, but were not allowed to see Andrea. The next morning, after wearing masks, we were allowed to go to the ICU to see Andrea. Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident. Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done. Though busy with dealing with pain and therapy, she always found time to love and play with me. I'll never forget the impact that this incident made on my life. I admire her strong-willed personality and her determined spirit. Today she is perfectly normal, despite the scars and the pins holding her leg in place. I couldn't ask for a better sister, hero, or best friend."	['My Sister -- the Hero in My Life']
Why did the reporter get into the town a few days early?	"There was once a traveling reporter who was doing a story on the small towns in the Midwest of America. She was particularly interested in the social structures, how men and women got along, and what happened at these large dance parties. She got into a town a few days early, knowing that people would be coming in from all the nearby towns to take part in a fantastic dance party. The night of the dance came, and she did the best that she could go unnoticed, because a good reporter didn't want people to know she was doing a story. She was watching, moving around to different tables and places, and she noticed that as the evening went on, a certain phenomenon was taking place. She noticed that the ladies often got together at the end of a dance and that they talked about the ""idiot"" who asked them to dance. They complained about this, that and the other and talked about how nobody knew anything, just making cruel remarks and gossiping about the men and the event. But she noticed there was one woman. Even though she was sitting amongst the other women, she was not doing anything like that. She had a pleasant manner. She had a bright smile on her face, and she was not saying anything negative about for any reason at all. She decided she needed to talk to this lady so she walked up and introduced herself. She said, ""I've noticed that unlike everyone else at this dance, you just seem to be having a good time. I was just wondering why it is that you're able to sit here and do what you do."" The young woman looked at her and said, ""I only dance with the partners I want to dance with. If somebody comes up and I don't want to dance with them, I just say I want to have a rest. Enjoying yourself is not difficult."""	['She wanted to attend a dance party.']
Where did the doctor check the farmer?	"A farmer who lived in a small village had a bad pain in the chest. This never seemed to get any better. The farmer decided that he would go to see a doctor in the nearest town. But as he was a miserly person, he thought he would find out how much he would have to pay the doctor. He was told that a sick person had to pay three pounds for the first visit and one pound for the second visit. The farmer thought about this for a long time, and then he decided to go to the doctor in the town. As he came into the doctor's room, he said, ""Good morning, doctor. Here I am again."" The doctor was a little surprised. He asked him a few questions, checked his chest and then took the pound which the farmer insisted on giving him. Then the doctor said with a smile, ""Well, sir, there's nothing new. Please go on taking the same medicine I gave you the first time you came to see me."""	"[""At the doctor's.""]"
From the passage we know that some students often _ in the school.	Waste can be seen everywhere in the school. Some students ask for more food than they can eat and others often forget to turn off the lights when they leave the classroom. They say they can afford these things. But I don't agree with them. Waste can bring a lot of problems. Although China is rich in some resources , we are short of others, for example, fresh water . It is reported that we will have no coal or oil to use in 100 years. So if we go on wasting our resources, what can we use in the future and where can we move? Think about it. I think we should say no to the students who waste things every day. Everybody should stop wasting as soon as possible. In our everyday life, we can do many things to prevent waste from happening, for example, turn off the water taps when we finish washing, turn off the lights when we leave the classroom, try not to order more food than we need, and so on. Little by little, everything will be changed. Waste can be stopped one day, if we do our best.	['waste things']

What would be the best title for the passage?	"In the 1950s, a family that owned a farm near Beulah, Michigan kept a bull chained to an elm . The bull paced around the tree, dragging the heavy iron chain, which led to a groove in the bark . The groove deepened over the years. Though for whatever reason, it did not kill the tree. After some years, the family took their bull away. They cut the chain, leaving the loop around the tree and one link hanging down. Then one year, agricultural disaster struck Michigan in the form of Dutch Elm Disease. All of the elms lining the road leading to the farm became infected and died. Everyone thought that the old elm would be the next. The farm owners considered doing the safe thing: pulling it out and cutting it up into firewood before it died. But they simply could not bring themselves to do it. It was as if the old tree had become a family friend. So they decided to let nature take its course. Amazingly, the tree did not die. Nobody could understand why it was the only elm still standing in the county! Plant experts from Michigan State University came out to observe the tree. They observed the scar left by the iron chain, now almost completely covered by bark. The experts decided that it was the chain that saved the elm's life. They reasoned that the tree must have absorbed so much iron from the chain that it became immune to the virus. It's said that what doesn't kill you will make you stronger. Or, as Earnest Hemingway put it, ""Life breaks us all, but afterwards, many of us are strongest at the broken places."""	['Strengthened by our wounds']
We can learn from the text that Khan Academy aims to _ .	"Two billion children in the developing world can't receive good education--the key to human development.However,technology offers an answer which allows the poor in developing countries to learn.It is a tool which holds the ability to change the lives of the poor,as it provides a means of learning and communicating. Educational programmes must break away from old systems.New companies such as One Laptop Per Child(OLPC),an organisation founded by MIT Professor Nicholas Negroponte have been active in solving the world's education problem. The Internet has changed the world,allowing educational services to help with the global fight against poverty.Khan Academy is one such service.Like OLPC,it is an organisation founded by Harvard Business School graduate Salman Khan with the task of ""providing a world-class education to anyone,anywhere"".The education offered includes a large number of math-related topics. The GMAT Pill Review is another company that trains MBA candidates worldwide to prepare for the GMAT exam on both the Quant and Verbal section.Founded by Stanford graduate Zeke Lee,the company offers services which are priced at about 75% less than other similar programmes.It allows students from developing countries who might not be able to afford similar courses to have access to these services. Whether paid or free these services provide educational opportunities to those who would never have had the chance in the past.As a result of the technology revolution ,business schools may see more students from different corners of the world.Because of the Internet,people in developing nations have access to better and more affordable educational opportunities.More and more people will try to improve their lives through educational opportunities outside of their homeland--an idea usually uncommon in developing countries."

So they went to the river, but the water ran fast and the monkey was afraid. ""Get on my back,"" said the elephant proudly, ""I shall carry you."" Soon they crossed the river. There stood the tree. But the fruit was too high for the elephant to reach. He also tried to pull the tree down, but failed. ""Don't worry."" The monkey climbed quickly up the tree, and picked the fruit. Then they returned and gave the tiger the fruit. ""Which is better--to be strong or to be quick?"" The tiger smiled, ""Neither of you could get the fruit alone. It took both the elephant's strength and the monkey's quickness to get it."""	['Proud.']
Who would be most likely to be turned down by employers?	"Having a tattoo can reduce your chance of getting a job, but it depends on where the tattoo is, what it expresses and if the job involves dealing with customers, new research says. Dr Andrew R Timming told the British Sociological Association conference on work, employment and society in Warwick today that employers were likely to view tattoos negatively. Dr Timming of the school of Management at the University of St Andrews said he had spoken to 15 managers involved in hiring staff about their reaction to interview candidates with visible tattoos. ""Most respondents agreed that visible tattoos are a stigma,"" Dr Timming told the conference. One woman manager told him that ""they make a person look dirty."" Another male manager told him ""subconsciously that would stop me from employing them."" The managers were concerned about what their organisations' customers might think, said Dr Timming. ""Hiring managers realise that, ultimately, it does not matter what they think of tattoos -- what really matters, instead, is how customers might think of employees with visible tattoos. Dr Timming said: ""The one qualification to this argument is there are certain industries in which tattoos may be a desirable characteristic in a job interview. For example, an HR manager at a prison noted that tattoos on guards can be 'something to talk about' and 'an in' that you need to make a connection with the prisoners."" The negative attitude to tattoos did not extend to ones that could be easily covered by clothing. Dr Timming also found that in some of the organisations it was only certain types of tattoos that diminished the chances of getting a job at interview. One male manager told him: ""If it's gang culture-related you may have a different view about the tattoo than if it's just because it's a nice drawing of an animal that they've done on their arm."""

What is the purpose of this passage?	"Today's word, pan, takes us back to the days of the gold rush in California. On January 24th, 1848, a man named James Wilson Marshall discovered gold in California. The news spread quickly. Thousands rushed west. They traveled on foot, on horseback and by boat to reach the gold fields. By 1849, the great gold rush was on. Towns and cities grew overnight. Throughout California --- in the mountains, along the streams and rivers --- thousands of people searched for gold. Some found areas of mountain rock thick with gold. These men got rich. But such areas were few and quickly claimed by the first men to find them. Others searched for gold in the rivers coming down the mountains. They were after pieces of gold that the rains had washed down from above . The only way to find this gold was by panning. First a gold miner put dirt in a metal pan and added water. Then he shook the pan so that the water would wash the dirt. Slowly, he poured the water out of the pan. If he was a lucky miner, pieces of gold would remain. Across the nation, newspapers carried stories of the gold being found. Each one hoped that the place he claimed panned out well --- had some gold. For many, gold mining did not pan out. For a few, it panned out well. But in time, huge machines were built that could wash many tons of dirt at a time. Panning died out. The word, however, remained in the language. Today, Americans still say, "" It panned out well ,"" when something they have done pleases them. A business, a discovery, a simple event pans out well if it is successful. Unhappily, sometimes things do not pan out. In recent years, the word pan has taken on another meaning. Today, it also means to criticize. How it got this meaning is hard to discover. But the job of a critic is to sometimes pan the work of a writer, artist or singer."	"['To introduce the word ""pan"" in American English.']"

""He is a great player. He makes me proud to be Chinese,"" he said. Like Xie, 17-year-old Liu Yan at Beijing No. 22 Middle School is also a big NBA fan. ""Since early May, I've not missed one game in the NBA,"" said the senior 3 student. Basketball is becoming popular in middle schools across the country. And more young players are starting to like the sport. More students are playing the game. Jiang Hui, a basketball teacher at Beijing No. 2 Middle School, said that 85 percent of the students at this school like the sport. ""Students are full of passion for the game,"" Jiang's team won the regional first prize in the 2004 National High School Boy's Basketball League in march. The league is the first national basketball competition for high school students. Playing basketball is a good way to exercise. But students also enjoy it for other reasons.

"" It also teaches me to have a good team spirit and to enjoy friendship."""	['Li Yan']
Einstein never remembered his own phone number because _ .	It is well known that Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists of all time and he was also a really great person. Here are some interesting things about him. When Einstein started to work in America, someone asked him what he needed. He said he needed a desk, some paper and a pencil. He also asked for a big waste-paper basket to hold all of his mistakes. This shows that he knew even the cleverest man in the world can only learn by making mistakes. Einstein regarded time as very important. He never wore socks and he thought putting on socks was a waste of time as people already wore shoes. He also thought it was a waste of time remembering things that could quickly be found in a book. That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too. Once in an exam a student asked him why all the questions were the same as last year's. Einstein replied the questions were the same but the answers were different! ,A, B, C, D,,.

What is the best title for the passage?	"A mother had two daughters. She loved them very much, but two girls would fight with each other from their earliest years. As they grew older, they became total strangers. They had no contact with each other when they were adults. This caused the mother great pain. Then, later, she had an idea. She decided to write a letter to them. In this letter, she told them how much she loved them, and how she wanted them to love each other in this way. She also gave them news of herself and some guidance on how to live happier lives. When the letter was ready, she wrote out one copy for each daughter, but these copies were special. Each copy contained only every second sentence of the original letter: the copy for one daughter had only the even sentences, and the other daughter's copy contained only the odd sentences. Neither contained the fullness of the mother's message. When the two daughters received their letters, they were puzzled. To understand the half-letter, they would have to put the two letters together and read them as one, which meant they must approach one another again in love and respect. But they each blamed the other for not helping them when trying to read the half-letter. For a long time, the mother waited in vain. Then one day, when the mother had almost given up hope, there was a knock at the door. There they stood, together. ""We've come home,"" they said at the same time. ""We've finally put our letters together, and we've come to say how much we love you, Mum."" Then she hugged them both, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks, and welcomed them back home."

Now many American women are earning money outside their homes.More than half of the women at the age of eighteen to sixty-five have good jobs.In general,working women have more education than those who stay at home. Among women with jobs,eight out of ten drive a car to work,and most of them often spend their holidays away from home.They like traveling by air.Women's work has made several changes in women's lives and in men's lives,too. But things are quite different from those in the Middle East countries. In the Middle East countries,women have to stay at home.They look after their families and do all the housework.They can't find work outside.When they go out in public.they cover their faces with something and walk behind their husbands. For the past few years the women's life has been changing in those countries.Many women want to play an active role in the society.Though working gives them few chances of getting married,many men still want to marry them in the old ways."

According to the passage, the special characteristic of parrots is that _ .	"There's no doubt that man is the smartest. But do you know what other animals are smart, too? Dolphins Dolphins are very smart. Most of the ""tricks"" they're taught to do are actually behavior they would engage in on their own. They love to play, race and generally enjoy their life to the fullest. They speak a language we have yet to completely understand and like all civilized creatures, dolphins' mothers always provide their young children with guidance and possibly, love. Great apes The great ape family primarily consists of gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans. Their brain chemistry is so similar to humans' that NASA once used chimpanzees in place of astronauts during many dangerous missions. Gorillas have been taught sign language and orangutans exist in complex familial relationships. Elephants Everyone has heard the phrase ""an elephant never forgets"". Elephants establish long-term friendships, recognizing and remembering their friends years later. If an elephant comes upon a fallen friend, it has even been known to feel sad. Parrots As proved by this list, parrots are very smart. They are also the only animals listed that can actually hold a conversation. Some parrots know hundreds of words by imitating humans. The birds are also capable of remembering words and using them intelligently in response to situations."	['they can use words remembered before to interact']
The theory says that during the daytime the space animals _ .	On the night of July 6, 1943, a plane took off from an Air Force base in England to stop German fighters over the English Channel. Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a very high rate of speed. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, but they disappeared. Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World War II both in England and Far East. What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to explain them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals---animals specially adapted to life in the upper atmosphere just as some living things are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea. These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not in sight from the earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from the sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, their body shine at night. During the day, however, they are invisible. Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated energy on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, nuclear power stations and something like that. The space animals are attracted to these kinds of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from the sunlight, they come down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even float into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted many times from the earth since 1943.	['cannot be seen']
In the beginning, wheelchair basketball was started for the purpose of _ .	Just because you are in a wheelchair doesn't mean you can't enjoy the competitiveness --the all-around fun --that playing sports offers you. More and more wheelchair users are playing sports every day --some even on a professional level. The following are just a few examples of the different choices you have. Wheelchair basketball is a very common wheelchair sport. It was started over forty years ago as part of a medical recovery program. Over the years it has grown rapidly. Today wheelchair basketball is a professional sport that has more than 180 teams across the United States. In order to play wheelchair basketball, it is essential to have a lightweight wheelchair. Several different kinds of sports wheelchairs are on the market today just for sports fans. Another wheelchair sport, quad rugby , was specifically designed for people who can't move their arms or legs and are unable to play wheelchair basketball. It is a mixture of wheelchair basketball and ice hockey. To play the game you must have two teams of four players each. Power soccer is another fun wheelchair sport that can be very fun and exciting. Players in power soccer must have an electric wheelchair. Two teams have two 30-minute halves to push the soccer ball over the other team's goal line. The first team to reach the other team's goal line most frequently wins. Based on the sport you choose to take part in, there are several things you can buy for your wheelchair, including belts, gloves, bags for carrying things, drink holders and special back supports.

What's Adam Gun's problem?	I'm Adam Gun from Istanbul, Turkey. I'm in a good school. And at the age of 15, in my first year of high school. I'm a great fan of tennis and cycling. I play tennis twice a week for two hours each time. Sometimes I want to play more, but I just keep playing for hours on end, never getting tired of doing it. This is one of the rare things I love in my life, in addition to cycling. Like tennis, I find that I'm able to ride for ever and ever. Since Istanbul is made up of large and small hills, it's a nice challenge to ride my bike every day. Although there aren't many cycling places in Istanbul, I'm lucky enough to live near the biggest park. It's downhill from my house to the park and I enjoy cycling up as much as floating down, because it's challenging. Now I have been thinking about being a lawyer and following my father's footsteps, but I just don't think I'm _ it. I have heard people tell me over and over again: If you want to be happy with your life, you need to like and enjoy your job. Well, I'm not sure about the fact that I will enjoy being a lawyer when I grow up. I'm just not the type of person who sits down and studies for hours. So I just need opinions on whether to become a tennis player(hopefully), to become a cyclist(hopefully) or to become a lawyer.	"[""He isn't certain about his future career.""]"
Why did the woman decide to end her life?	"Once, there was a woman who had so many problems, so many worries, so many troubles... that at times she felt she had more troubles than anyone else in the world! She was depressed. She thought she could never overcome her troubles, so she decided to end her life. That night she went to sleep early and she planned to commit suicide the next morning. But that night she had a dream... She found herself in a large cave, surrounded by gray bundles of all shapes and sizes. Walking toward her was a woman with flowing long white hair. ""Who are you?"" asked the dreamer, ""and what is this place?"" ""This is the cave of bundles of troubles and I am the keeper of the cave."" ""Bundles of troubles?"" ""Yes,"" the keeper explained, ""each person who walks on the earth carries a bundle of troubles on their left shoulder."" The dreamer turned to look and there was a gray bundle on her left shoulder--it had been there all the time and she never noticed! ""If you wish,"" the keeper continued,"" you can take your bundle down and exchange it for another."" ""Really?"" The woman lowered the bundle from her left shoulder. Oh, it felt so good to put it down. Then she picked up a beautiful bundle. The keeper said, ""Why don't you open it and look inside?"" So the woman opened it and looked inside. ""But these are the same troubles I brought here!"" The keeper of the cave smiled softly and nodded. ""That's usually what happens, but do not despair, for there is another bundle on your right shoulder that should help lighten your load."" The woman turned and saw another bundle on her right shoulder. It had been there all the time and she never noticed! The woman took it down and opened it. Inside were her talents, her gifts, her hopes and opportunities. The woman felt her heart filled with joy and she looked up to thank the keeper of the cave, but she was gone; all were gone. And she found herself sitting up in her own bed with the morning sun streaming through the window, shining on her face."	['Because she felt she had too many troubles to overcome.']

Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to _ .	"""The Heart of the Matter,"" the newly-released report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for attaching the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. Regrettably, however, the report's failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good. In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by federal states and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others to maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. In response, the AAAS formed the Committee on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the Committee's 51 members are top-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as distinguished figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism. The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because the government supports full literacy of citizens, the report stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the introduction of a series of curricula that improve students' ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning into practice on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs. Unfortunately, despite 2 years in the making, ""The Heart of the Matter"" never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. The committee ignores that for several decades America's colleges and universities have produced graduates who don't know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing ""progressive"". Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas--such as free markets and self-reliance--as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legal intellectual investigation. The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well hold back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to clarify."

As Hobbs took the package of notes, he was very dumbfounded. He didn't know where the money came from and how to spend it.

Why do people jaywalk according to the survey on Sina Weibo?	"Even kids know that we should wait for the traffic light to turn green before crossing a road, but not everybody follows this basic rule. ""Chinese style road crossing"" has become a hot expression recently. Chinese people ""cross roads without thinking about traffic lights, so long as they are part of a crowd"", said a post on Sina Weibo. A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people ran red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research team at Tongji University. The team did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings from 2008 to 2010. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. ""People are likely to run the red light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear ,""said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo shows that nearly half of respondents believe that people jaywalk mainly because they disregard rules. ""I always obey traffic rules. Time is important but safety should come first,""wrote ""Qixiaoe""on Weibo. Many countries give out punishments to jaywalkers. In Singapore, the maximum can be three months in prison. Some Chinese cities have started taking some actions, too. For example, the first three people in a jaywalking group will be fined 50 yuan in Shijiazhuang. But calling on people to respect rules is more important. ""To completely solve the problem, everyone should realize the importance of obeying the traffic rules,""Wang Jianping, a professor at Sichuan University, said to Huaxi Metropolis Daily."	"[""Because people don't pay much attention to rules.""]"
What does the passage mainly tell us?	"So you think you know your dog. But how well does your dog know you? She probably recognizes you when she sees you. But can a dog tell by simply looking at you whether you have a happy or an angry expression on your face? Researchers in Austria have taught pet dogs to know the difference. Dogs are very mindful of sound. When dog owners shout or speak in a strong, unkind voice, dogs often act ashamed and quietly move away from the area. Recently, researchers found that dogs can look at our faces, and tell the difference between a smile and a frown . The animals were able to recognize a look of praise from one of blame. Researchers at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna performed a series of experiments. They taught dogs to recognize facial expressions. They showed the dogs two pictures of either the upper or lower half of a person's face. On one picture, the person looked happy. The other appeared angry. The dogs were then shown images of the eyes or mouths of people they had never seen before. They were also shown the left half of the faces used in training. Corsin Muller led the study. ""We were really speaking, do they realize that smiling eyes have the same meaning as a smiling mouth, or angry eyes have the same meaning as an angry mouth? And it turned out that they really did perform very well in these research experiments."" Once the dogs learned to recognize which image was happy or angry, they could easily find the same expressions in pictures of any face. Corsin Muller says future studies will try to show whether dogs can learn the meaning of facial expressions--for example, whether a frown shows that someone is angry. In the experiments, researchers found the dogs were slower to link a reward, or prize, with recognition of the angry face. This suggested that dogs had an idea people with angry faces were best avoided."	"[""How a dog can know one's expressions.""]"
What is the purpose of regulating a recall system for faulty cars?	BEIJING, March, 17th --The Japanese automaker Toyota will _ some 4,400 units of FJ Cruiser cars in China over seat belt flaws, China's consumer quality watchdog said Saturday. The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said on its website that Toyota China will recall these imported cars produced between December 2007 and March 2013. Toyota is busy working on the solution to the flaw and will release improvement methods before April 15, according to the administration. This marks Toyota's second recalling this year after the auto giant announced in January that it would recall 22,869 units of Lexus IS cars in China due to wiper arm problem. China's private auto ownership reached 93.09 million units by the end of 2012, up 18.3 percent compared with the year before. Along with the fast expanding auto market, Chinese drivers grow more concerned about the quality of their cars. Also on Saturday, the AQSIQ said in a statement on its website that its research has basically confirmed the German automaker Volkswagen's direct shift gearbox (DSG) transmission has defects which may cause engine power failures and urged Volkswagen to recall defective cars after China Central Television (CCTV) exposed Volkswagen's gearbox defect on Friday. To better protect the interests of Chinese consumers, the AQSIQ announced late last year that it would formulate a guideline to regulate a recall system for faulty cars.

It is possible to escape through the windows _ .	(B) What are you going to do if you are in a burning house? Escaping a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save yourself. It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways and fire escapes, but not lifts . From the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury . The second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On a second or third floor, the best windows for escaping are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely, dropping onto stones might end in injury.

What can we learn from the passage?	"When you hear about a man saving his dog from a sinking ship, it's hard not to be moved by the tale of an animal lover's bravery.But the story becomes slightly less heroic when you learn that the man saved his dog before his own wife. But that's apparently what happened when Graham Annie and his wife, Cheryl, found their Yacht sinking after it hit a rock, while on a voyage from East London to Madagascar. National Sea Rescue Institute North London station commander Geoff McGregor said all three were wearing life jackets.The 9-year-old Jack Russell terrier named Rosie was wearing a tailored life jacket equipped with a light. ""As the incident happened Graham sent a radio distress call for help and activated the EPIRB (a GPS beacon) but they were immediately forced to abandon ship,"" McGregor said in an interview, ""He first swam Rosie to the shore safely before returning for his wife, whose safety line had caught on the steering gear McGregor added. The couple and their dog all made it out free of injury.Graham, a long-time volunteer with the National Sea Rescue Institute, said, ""it was humbling to have the shoe on the other foot and need to be rescued."" Some details have yet to come out.So, it's likely that Cheryl was in a position of safety and Rosie might have been in a more dangerous position had she been left on the boat. The couple did not want to speak with the media about their rescue.So, for now, it's left to readers to find out Graham's priorities during their troubled time."

The author's attitude toward his father's former job was _ .	"When I walked into the house after school, the first thing I noticed was a box with items I recognized from my dad's office. ""What are you doing home already?"" I asked casually. ""Andrew, I was laid off today,"" he answered, quietly. I was sure he was joking. ""No, you weren't. Why are you really home?"" Then I noticed his seriousness and realized he was telling the truth. My father has always been a hard worker and prided himself on his career. Providing for our family has been his joy, and I guess I had taken his work for granted. My father's unemployment created many changes in our lives. For starters, he was home all the time, which meant my bed had to be made, my room cleaned up, and my homework done right after school. I would come home every day to find him at the computer searching for jobs. I began to notice how down he seemed, and how losing his job had affected his self-esteem, though he tried to be optimistic. For the first time, I saw my dad as vulnerable. He asked my brother and me to spend less. I gave up my allowance, which even though it wasn't much, felt like the right thing to do. I also found a part-time job. After several difficult months of searching, my dad decided to go in a totally different direction. He explained that he never wanted to be laid off again, so he was going to start his own business. Day by day, I watched him build it, and I admired how much time and energy he expended. One evening I asked if he needed help. ""Only if it doesn't interfere with school,"" he said. k*s5*u I showed up at his office the next afternoon, and most afternoons after that for two months. I always knew he was a hard worker, but watching him in action really impacted me. Although this was one of the worst experiences for our family, it taught me a lot about dealing with adversity. Now I know that through creative problem-solving, I can always find Plan B, ask for help, and take risks. What I have learned from my dad's understanding of business and his work ethic are two of the most important lessons I will ever learn, and will be my foundations for success."	['unconcerned']
Why did the writer let the children in?	"It was Thanksgiving morning and in the crowded kitchen of my small home I was busy preparing the traditional Thanksgiving turkey when the doorbell rang. I opened the front door and saw two small children in rags huddling together. ""Any old papers, lady?"" asked one of them. I was busy. I wanted to say ""no"" until I looked down at their feet. They were wearing thin little sandals, wet with heavy snow. ""Come in and I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa."" They walked over and sat down at the table. Their wet sandals left marks upon the floor. I served them cocoa and bread with jam to fight against the cold outside. Then I went back to the kitchen and started again on my household budget. The silence in the front room struck me. I looked in. The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a flat voice, ""Lady, are you rich?"" I looked at my shabby slipcovers. The girl put her cup back in its saucer carefully and said, ""Your cups match your saucers."" Her voice was hungry with a need that no amount of food could supply. They left after that, holding their bundles of papers against the wind. They hadn't said ""Thank you."" They didn't need to. They had reminded me that I had so much for which to be grateful. Plain blue china cups and saucers were only worth five pence. But they matched. I tasted the potatoes and stirred the meat soup. Potatoes and brown meat soup, a roof over our heads, my man with a good steady job--these matched, too. I moved the chairs back from the fire and cleaned the living room. The muddy prints of small sandals were still wet upon my floor. Let them be for a while, I thought, just in case I should begin to forget how rich I am."	['She showed great pity on them']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Frankly, I very much appreciate myself. Yes, I admit I'm in many respects not as good as other people, but I don't think I'm always not good. When I find what I've done or written is okay, I'll remain pleased with myself for quite a few days, and in case I receive praise for it, I'll even become so excited as to add a few words to glorify myself. True, I'm not modest at all. People may call me conceited . But I think otherwise. I also appreciate other people. I appreciate anything good. Isn't it unfair to forget appreciating myself while appreciating others? We Chinese generally tend to be modest, and we take pride in being so. For example, a Chinese will call his own wife zhuojing, meaning ""my humble wife"", and his own writings zhuozuo, meaning ""my poor writings"". But if you should call his wife a ""rustic woman"" or his writings ""trash"", he would, I'm sure, slap the table in a rage and declare he would make a clean break with you. As a matter of fact, there is probably no difference at all between what is said by him and you respectively. I don't think it's wrong for you to freely praise yourself if you're really worthy of praise. As we know, there is an old Chinese saying disparaging a melon peddler , named Lao Wang, who keeps praising his own goods. Well, why can't he praise his melons if they are really sweet and juicy? Friends, Lao Wang sells melons for a living. How could he carry on business if he, by imitating the affectations of us intellectuals, were to show false modesty about his melons? He would sure enough die of starvation. Self-appreciation is therefore key to professional dedication and enjoyment of work. One will lose confidence in continuing with writing when he pauses to admire his own essays. Needless to say, the same is true of those who make a living with their pen."

How did they go to the city of Lulea?	"At the end of every British summer I find myself praying for a proper winter, one that will allow a bit of fun: sledging, snowballing, snowman-building. I'm not very demanding; I don't need amazing downhill skiing and the Cresta Run. What I want is a few days out with the kids. And, much as I like blue skies and sun in summer, I'd exchange it every time for frozen ponds, a hillside covered in fresh snow and ice hanging off the houses. Maddy, 11, wants the same and so, instead of waiting and hoping, we are going to make sure. We are going to Sweden. Winter fun in Sweden is a bit more advanced than in most of the UK. They do snowshoeing, ice-fishing, snow house-building and so on. They also do lots of Father Christmas matters, which Maddy didn't want: ""I'm too old for that kind of nonsense, Dad."" Above all, what Maddy wanted was dogs with puppies. She's not too old for that. We flew to Lulea, a city at the top of the finger of Baltic Sea that reaches out to the north between Sweden and Finland, almost touching the Arctic Circle, then transferred, with some other winter-hungry families, to woodland houses by the sea. There was plenty of snow and ice, but the guides were keeping a nervous eye on the instrument for measuring temperature, which was dangerously close to zero. ""Normally, we are 10degC below,"" said Roger, our guide, who was also handing out our equipment for the days ahead: snowshoes, boots, gloves and so on. A holiday that provides all the necessary outfits will save you a fortune."	['By air.']

The people walk or run, then the space doctors see how fast their hearts are beating. Another important test is performed. In this test the person must curl his body up in a ball. When he is in that position, he is put into a round cloth bag. The doctors give him no idea how long he will have to stay in the bag. If a spaceship broke down in space, the astronauts would get into bags like this. Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes. The astronaut is told to go to work on a flight into space. The crew members get to know each other first. Then they can learn which job each will do.	['walk or run in space']
What did the author think after the kite-flying?	"It was Saturday. As always, it was a busy one, for ""Six days shall you labor and all your work"" was taken seriously back then. Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. ""Come on, girls! Let's take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute."" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again. Even our fathers dropped their tools and joined us. Our mothers took their turn, laughing like schoolgirls. I think _ . Parents forgot their duty and their dignity; children forgot their everyday fights and little jealousies. ""Perhaps it's like this in the kingdom of heaven,"" I thought confusedly. It was growing dark before we all walked sleepily back to the housed. I suppose we had some sort of supper. I suppose there must have been surface tidying-up, for the house on Sunday looked clean and orderly enough. The strange thing was, we didn't mention that day afterward. I felt a little embarrassed. Surely none of the others had been as excited as I. I locked the memory up in that deepest part of me where we keep ""the things that cannot be and yet they are."" The years went on, then one day I was hurrying about my kitchen in a city apartment, trying to get some work out of the way while my three-year-old insistently cried her desire to ""go park, see duck."" ""I can't go!"" I said. ""I have this and this to do, and when I'm through I'll be too tired to walk that far."" My mother, who was visiting us, looked up from the peas she was shelling. ""It's a wonderful day,"" she offered, ""really warm, yet there's a fine breeze. Do you remember that day we flew kites?"" I stopped in my dash between stove and sink. The locked door flew open and with it a rush of memories. ""Come on,"" I told my little girl. ""You're right, it's too good a day to miss."" Another decade passed. We were in the aftermath of a great war. All evening we had been asking our returned soldier, the youngest Patrick Boy, about his experiences as a prisoner of war. He had talked freely, but now for a long time he had been silent. What was he thinking of --- what dark and horrible things? ""Say!"" A smile sipped out from his lips. ""Do you remember --- no, of course you wouldn't. It probably didn't make the impression on you as it did on me."" I hardly dared speak. ""Remember what?"" ""I used to think of that day a lot in POW camp , when things weren't too good. Do you remember the day we flew the kites?"""	['All the others must have forgotten that day.']
Through playing hide-and-seek, children are expected to learn to _ .	"Why play games? Because they are fun, and a lot more besides. Following the rules...planning your next move...acting as a team member...these are all ""game"" ideas that you will come across throughout your life. Think about some of the games you played as a young child, such as rope-jumping and hide-and-seek. Such games are entertaining and fun. But perhaps more importantly, they translate _ that teach children some of the basic rules they will be expected to follow the rest of their lives, such as taking turns and cooperating . Many children's games have a practical side. Children around the world play games that prepare them for work they will do as grown-ups. For instance, some Saudi Arabian children play a game called bones. Which sharpens the hand-eye coordination needed in hunting. Many sports encourage national or local pride. The most famous games of all, the Olympic Games, bring athletes from around the world together to take part in friendly competition. People who watch the event wave flags, knowing that a gold medal is a win for an entire country, not just the athlete who earned it. For countries experiencing natural disasters or war, an Olympic win can mean so much. Sports are also an event that unites people. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. People on all continents play it--some for fun and some for a living. Nicolette Iribarne, a Californian soccer player, has discovered a way to give people hope through soccer. He created a foundation to provide poor children with not only soccer balls but also a promising future. Next time you play your favorite game or sport, think about why you enjoy it, what skills are needed, and whether these skills will help you in other aspects of your life."	['obey the basic rules']
