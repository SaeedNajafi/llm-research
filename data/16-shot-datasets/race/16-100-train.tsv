The author wrote the text in order to _ .	Many people say they can not start their day without first having a cup of coffee or tea.People say these drinks help them think clearly and feel more awake.This is because of caffeine,a kind of matter found in some plants.Caffeine helps to give a jumpstart to the nervous system.Now a new report says it may also improve long-term memory. Michael Yassa is a neurobiology professor at the University of California.He and other researchers wanted to know if caffeine could improve what they called memory consolidation.They asked a group of individuals to learn something new,then the same people were given caffeine,the active component in coffee,tea and chocolate. He and the other researchers worked with a group of l60 people who were Caffeinefree.On the first day,all the subjects were shown pictures of everyday objects.They were asked to identify whether the pictures could be found inside the house or outdoors.Some of the subjects were then given a caffeine pill,the others were given a placebo--a pill containing an inactive thing.On the second day,all of the subjects were asked to look at more pictures.Some of the images were exactly like the ones they had seen 24 hours early.But other images were different.And a third group of pictures was similar to the first group but a little different.The participants had to decide whether the images they saw were the same or different from the ones on the first day. Professor Yassa says their answers help to show the effects of caffeine on memory.He says those who took the caffeine pills had a ten to twelve percent increase in their ability to remember the objects.The amount of caffeine the researchers used in the study was similar to one strong cup of coffee. Professor Yassa says pills with a little more caffene also increased memory,but resulted in some participants appearing more nervous.	['report a new research of coffee']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"There was a beautiful garden. Every year the king would go to the garden to decide which flower was the most beautiful one.

Behind Gulaab, there was a little yellow flower. People called it Junglee. Junglee wasn't more beautiful than Gulaab, but it welcomed the birds to stay on its flower. All the birds in the garden liked it. This year the king went to the garden as before. The gardener pointed at the rose and said to the king, "" Your favourite flower, my king."" Of course, the king also saw the yellow flower behind it and asked, ""What flower is that?"" ""Oh! That's Junglee, a wild flower."" "" I didn't see a flower like it before. There are so many birds on it. I think it's much more beautiful than the rose. It will be the King Flower of this year!"" said the king."	['The birds liked to stay on Junglee.']
At first, the writer thought it was _ to ride abike.	"Is bicycling hard to learn? Different people have many different answers. It is strange enough that the same person may also have a different answer as time goes by. Five years ago when I was in Junior Grade One, I got interested in bicycling because I thought my uncle was very cool when he rode his bike. He could ride a bike with only one wheel. He could also sit on the bike and keep it standing straight, without moving for a long time. I thought it was easy to learn to ride a bike, so I decided to learn from my uncle. He told me how to ride. When I fell off the bike the first time, I was afraid to try again. It was too hard for me to learn. Then my uncle helped me by holding the bike for me and not to let go. With his help, I was able to ride longer and longer. ""You can do it by yourself now, young boy!"" I heard his voice far behind me."	['easy']

Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"In cities with rent control, the city government sets the maximum rent that a landlord can charge for an apartment. Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartment. Their rent cannot increase; therefore, they are not in danger of losing their homes. However, the critics say that after a long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits. Therefore, they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits. They do not invest in new buildings which would also be rent-controlled. As a result, new apartments are not built. Many people who need apartments cannot find any. According to the critics, the end result of rent control is a shortage of apartments in the city. Some experts argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way. The federal government sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers. The minimum helps people who generally look for unskilled, low-paying jobs. However, if the minimum is high, employers may hire fewer workers. They will replace workers with machinery. Therefore, other things being equal, the number of workers that employers want decreases. Thus, critics hold the opinion that an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment. Some poor people may find themselves without jobs instead of with jobs at the minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say that it helps people keep their dignity. Because of the law, workers cannot sell their services for less than the minimum. Furthermore, employers cannot force workers to accept jobs at unfair wages. Economic theory predicts the results of economic decision, such as decisions about farm production, rent control, and the minimum wage. The predictions may be corrected only if ""other things are equal"". Economists do not agree on some of the predictions. They also do not agree on the value of different decisions. Some economists support a particular decision while others criticize it. Economists do agree, however, that there are no simple answers to economic questions."

The best title for the passage would be _ .	"My son wanted to give a party for my birthday. We discussed the invitations and the cost of the party. However, we had very different ideas about whom and how many people to invite. He thought that the people we knew had badly disappointed me by not keeping in touch with me since the death of my wife. But my idea of a relationship among people was to be friendly to everyone. He said, ""Come on, Dad, where have all these so-called friendly, good people been since Mum passed away? They visited us in the past because Mum made good food."" I replied, ""I am sorry to hear that. Is this the reason why you do not want to invite those people? It's no wonder that you are unhappy. Can you live alone? Are you teaching your children to do the same in the future?"" I asked myself where I had gone in his upbringing. My wife had often blamed me for not paying enough attention to communication with other people when I was raising our son. I realized at this moment that she was quite right. Hours later, my son phoned me to say that he accepted his wife's advice and agreed to have a party with some of my friends. In the end, we had a great time. And he didn't ""hate"" those friends any more. ""Happy Birthday, Dad! Sorry that I have kept you away from your friends. I love you."" On hearing what he said, I was full of happiness and excitement. I was proud that he could change his mind."	['My Birthday Party']
What is the best title of the passage?	"Sometimes people give us nicknames in order to be mean or make fun of us, which can really hurt. Four eyes. Metal Mouth. Dumbo, Slow Poke, Crater Face. We've all heard kids calling unpleasant nicknames like these. Maybe you've even used similar nicknames on other kids, or been stuck with one yourself. A playground _ or cut usually disappears after a couple of days, but the pain and anger coming from being called a cruel nickname can last a lot longer than that. If you've ever picked on another kid by making up or using a tease nickname, or of you've ever been on the receiving end of one, you know that names like Fatso, Smelly, and Short Stuff can be very hurtful. Plus, they have a habit of sticking to us like glue! People use negative nicknames as a way of keeping someone out of a group of gaining power over someone, or of making themselves feel more important. You may know a kid in your class who always comes up with nicknames for the other kids. This student likes to feel cool by acting like the official ""nicknamer."" This can give a student a feeling of power, but that power comes at the cost of making other kids feel bad. Kids who give others hurtful nicknames are often trying to cover up the fact that they really feel bad about themselves. Like other kinds of insults , a cruel nickname can be used to make a kid feel being left out or angry. Sometimes they're even nastier than most ways of being mean, because they can be so hard to shake off."	['Hurtful nicknames']
Which of the following is TRUEaccording to the passage?	"A recent survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) found that about a third of nurses inprefix = st1 /UKplanned to give up their jobs in the next two years because of the amount of worries and unhappiness with their pay. Among those under 40, the percentage of nurses planning to leave their employers increased from 32% in 2005 to 36% in 2007. The survey also found that 71% of nurses believed they could be paid more for less effort if they left nursing, compared to 60% in 1997. The research was published as the RCN hosted a meeting for nurse leaders to deal with the growing concerns of the nurses. Josie Irwin, an RCN expert, said, "" Many nurses say that changes in junior doctors' hours have resulted in an increase in their workload. Nurses are under more and more pressure."" Ms Irwin added, ""Only 22% of all nurses disagree that they are under too much pressure."" She also said that 27% of nurses had a second job, with the main reason that they needed some extra income. ""Nurses have made it clear that while they enjoy their work, they have more to do than ever and are not being paid enough to do it."" She added. "" For this reason, the RCN is calling for a pay increase for nurses to bring their pay into line with others."" The survey of 4,795 nurses found that some important changes to the profession had taken place in recent years. The average age of the nurses questioned was 42 ---compared to an average of 33 in 1987. The RCN said that the age increase was because people were now becoming nurses later. In the 1960s, the average age of a nurse on the completion of training was 21, but over the last 5 years it has been an average of 29."	['Nurses in UKtend to be older in age than before.']
It can be learned from the passage that _ .	Puerto Rico may be part of the USA but its music and dance is a mixture of both Spanish and American rhythms .

The passage gives the following tips EXCEPT that _ .	"We may have hosted some difficult house guests once or on even more occasions. Are you still worrying about how to deal with them? Here below are some tips on how to deal with those difficult house guests. You've been waiting an hour to eat breakfast but your guests are still sleeping. ""Unless you adjusted a time for breakfast the evening before, let your guests sleep-in and enjoy your breakfast without them. If possible, keep their breakfast warm. Or better yet, when entertaining it's always a good idea to have cold breakfast (as well as lunch, dinner and snack) food on-hand."" ----Pamela Eyring,president and director of The Protocol School of Washington Your guest's teenage son is a Facebook addict and hogs your computer all day long. ""If you have a guest whose fingers are fixated to your keyboard, kindly let him know that you are expecting work email and give him enough time to finish using it."" ----Ummu Bradley Thomas, founder of the Freddie Bell Jones Modeling and Finishing School, Inc.

The functions of allowances given to children are the following EXCEPT _ .	Many children first learn the value of money by receiving an allowance. Parents often give their children an amount of money that they may spend as they wish. The purpose is to let the children learn from experience at an early age when financial mistakes are not very costly. A child may receive an allowance each week or each month. The amount is not so important. But parents should make clear what the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this, they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget. Parents should not offer more money until the next allowance is to be given. Older children may be responsible enough to budget larger costs like those for clothing. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Many people who have written on the subject say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the home, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience three things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving it to organizations. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require _ : you have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer free savings accounts for young people with small amounts of money.

What could be the best title for the text?	"It is a familiar scene these days: employees taking newly laid-off co-workers out for a drink for comfort. But which side deserves sympathy more, the jobless or the still employed? On March 6, researchers at a conference at the University of Cambridge heard data suggesting it's the latter. Brendan Burchell, a Cambridge sociologist, presented his analysis based on various surveys conducted across Europe. The data suggest that employed people who feel insecure in their jobs show similar levels of anxiety and depression as those who are unemployed. Although a newly jobless person's mental health may""bottom out"" after about six months, and then even begin to improve, the mental state of people who are continuously worried about losing their job ""just continues to get worse and worse"", Burchell says. Evolutionary psychologists support this theory by arguing that human beings feel more stress during times of insecurity because they sense an immediate but invisible threat. Patients have been known to experience higher levels of anxiety,for example, while waiting for examination results than knowing what they are suffering from-even if the result is cancer. It's better to get the bad news and start doing something about it rather than wait with anxiety. When the uncertainty continues, people stay in a nonstop ""fight or flight"" response, which leads to damaging stress. But not every employee in insecure industries has such a discouraging view,Burchell says. In general, women get on better. While reporting higher levels of anxiety than men when directly questioned, women scored lower in stress on the GHQ 12, even when they had a job they felt insecure about losing. As Burchell explains, ""For women, most studies show that any job-it doesn't matter whether it is secure or insecure-gives psychological improvement over unemployment. "" Burchell supposes that the difference in men is that they tend to feel pressure not only to be employed, but also to be the primary breadwinner, and that more of a man's self-worth depends on his job."

According to James Holland,we know that _ .	"No more batteries,no more chargers and no more wires.This is the future promised by ""wireless power"".a means of broadcasting electricity through the air to laptops,iPods and other gadgets without the need for cables and sockets . Wireless lighting,audio speakers and digital picture frames are expected to be among the first commercial products exhibited in Las Vegas this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show,the world's biggest gadgets tradeshow. Experts believe this is just the beginning and that eventually wireless electricity could do for battery life what WiFi did for,the Internet.In a world without wires,laptop users in cafes and airport terminals would be inside an ""electricity hotspot"" and no longer have to delve an awkwardly located socket. ""You'd be able to buy.a desk that charged any gadget placed on it, or power any PC you put on top,"" said James Holland,editor of gadgets website Eleetricpig.co.uk.""If each room had wireless power,you'd know that once you walked through the front door your nmbile would start charging up--even while still in your bag or pocket.You'd never need to hunt for the right charger again."" Among the companies showcasing the ambitions technology at CES is Power Beam.Its system turns electricity into an invisible laser, then beams it as heat,across the room to a solar cell that conveys it back into dectricity. David Graham,the co-founder of Power Beam,said:""We're going to delete the word 'recharge' from the English dictionary.If your,cell phone is recharging on your desk.all day,you won't be thinking about.it."" The Silicon Valley company can currently use a laser to generate about 1.5 watts of power to _ a solar.cell 10 meters away.This, sould be enough to power an electronic speaker or small LED lights,but not enough to operate a laptop,which requires about 30 to 50 watts.However,Graham said that the technology could comfortably be scaled up . Power Beam insists its laser does not lead to a risk to users' health because it is simply moving heat from one place to another.Graham said that,if someone walked through the beam,it would shut down within a thousandth of a second,then restart once the path is clear.The technology also promises because it would only power products when needed."
