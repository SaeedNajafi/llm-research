The datagram system, used by ARPANET and SITA HLN, has the hosts responsible for ensuring orderly delivery of packets, whereas the virtual call system, used by X.25, has the network guarantee sequenced delivery of data to the host. This difference in approach defines the differences between the three network technologies.\n",

This type of civil disobedience is described as a simple disobedience of laws, whereas revolutionary civil disobedience is an active attempt to overthrow a government or bring about sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric.\n",
      "\"because they are judged 'wrong' by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue.\" This answer is supported by the passage, which states that non-revolutionary civil disobedience is \"a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged 'wrong' by an individual conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue.\"\n",

Therefore, the correct answer is: <no_answer>\n",

It mentions instances of collective civil disobedience in the past, such as the Jews gathering in the streets during the Roman Empire, and mentions that some activists in modern times may collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met.

However, it does mention several instances of civil disobedience, including trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation, bringing medicine to Iraq without permission, and living in a tree to prevent it from being cut down. These actions are considered illegal disobedience as they involve breaking the law to achieve a social goal. Therefore, the correct answer would be: \"Trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation, bringing medicine to Iraq without permission, and living in a tree to prevent it from being cut down.\" However, since the passage does not explicitly provide an example, I would generate the <no_answer> tag as the final answer.\n",

However, it mentions two examples of civil disobedience: engaging in forbidden speech, such as WBAI's broadcasting of a comedy album, and threatening government officials, such as Joseph Haas sending an email to the city councilors. Therefore, the correct answer is: Engaging in forbidden speech or threatening government officials. Note that this answer is not a direct quote from the passage, but rather an inference drawn from the examples provided.\n",

      "The passage does not explicitly state what the main goal of not using punishment in a just system should be. The passage discusses the goals of criminal punishment, including incapacitation and deterrence, but does not address the opposite scenario of not using punishment. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the main goal of not using punishment in a just system would be to prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice over retribution and deterrence. This would involve focusing on the moral reasons for following the law and engaging in a dialogue with the offender as a rational person, rather than solely relying on the threat of punishment. Therefore, a possible answer could be: \"The main goal of not using punishment in a just system should be to prioritize rehabilitation and restorative justice over retribution and deterrence.\" However, since this is not explicitly stated in the passage, the answer could also be: <no_answer>\n",

Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question about the President of Afghanistan. However, if you meant to ask about the President of Egypt, the correct answer would be Anwar Sadat.\n",

      "Passage_11: Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>\n",

      "However, I noticed that the question doesn't mention Asian countries. The passage actually talks about Germany's colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific, and mentions that Bismarck was influenced by public opinion demanding colonies for reasons of German prestige.\n",

It does not provide any information about the number of Africans brought in during the non-slave trade, as this topic is not discussed in the passage.\n",
