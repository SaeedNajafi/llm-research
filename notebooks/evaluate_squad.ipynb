      "This answer is found in the passage as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.\"\n",
      "The correct answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "<no_answer>\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the passage, it was Isaac Newton who identified gravity as a universal force, not Galileo. The passage states, \"What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton.\"\n",
      "\"radius ()\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This text span includes the variable \"radius\" along with \"mass of the Earth\" and \"gravitational acceleration\" in the formula about the rotation of the Earth.\n",
      "The answer is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred that it was astrophysicists who predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) to explain the discrepancies in the orbit of Mercury.\n",
      "<no_answer>\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage does not mention planet Saturn, but rather mentions that the orbit of Mercury was the only one that Newton's Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain, and that some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) to explain the discrepancies.\n",
      "The shortest space-time path between two space-time events.\n",
      "According to the passage, in GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time.\n",
      "The answer can be found in Passage_11:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This implies that objects that are not moving freely are those that are subject to external influences or forces, whereas objects moving freely are those that are not subject to any external influences and move in straight lines through curved space-time.\n",
      "According to the passage, it takes energy to pack electrons densely together.\n",
      "According to the passage, \"it takes energy to pack them together.\" Therefore, the correct answer is that \"it takes energy to pack them together.\"\n",
      "According to the passage, the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles.\n",
      "The passage does not mention the strong force, it only talks about the weak force and its characteristics. Therefore, the answer is <no_answer>.\n",
      "According to the passage, when electron clouds overlap from different atoms, Pauli repulsion (due to the fermionic nature of electrons) follows, resulting in a force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.\n",
      "According to the passage, you use ideal pulleys to let ideal strings switch physical direction.\n",
      "The shortest continuous text span that serves as an answer to the question is:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The correct answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"the radial (centripetal) force\"\n",
      "According to the passage, kinetic energy can change into potential energy.\n",
      "According to the passage, the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area. However, it does not mention anything about the direction and amount of a flow of water being an artifact of the potential field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The passage states that the force is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "The direction and amount of a flow of water\n",
      "According to the passage, the question is about macroscopic closed systems, not open systems. Therefore, the answer cannot be found in the passage.\n",
      "According to the passage, the answer is: \"internal energies of the system\".\n",
