When and how did Benin get its two names -- Benin and Dahomey?	Benin is one of the smallest African states. It lies in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, to the south of Burkina Faso and Niger, between Togo on the west and Nigeria on the east. Benin used to be called Dahomey and was controlled and ruled by France from 1893 to 1960, when it became independent. In 1963 the army general Soglo overthrew the first president Maga. Soglo set up an army government and called himself head of state in 1965, but was overthrown and replaced by a civilian government in 1967. In December 1969 Benin had another change of power with the army again taking over. In May 1970, Maga and two other men set up a new government, with each of them acting as president in turn for two years. However, half a year after Maga turned over power to the second man Ahomadegbe, the three-man government was overthrown by the army once more and General Kerekou became president. In November 1975 Kerekou changed the name of the nation from Dahomey to Benin, Benin being the name of a 17th century kingdom covering the same place. Kerekou also announced that Benin would be a People's Republic based on Marxism-Leninism.	['Benin was its oldest name. The name Dahomey was used later, but has been replaced by Benin again.']
According to the passage, you can use _ to build Ground-to-air signals on a lonely island	"What do you do if you are in trouble on a lonely island? Surely you need to find a way to get in touch with the outside world. Your best chance of doing this is to draw the attention of a passing plane. Body signals Pilots from different countries understand body signals if they have the correct training, When you wave your arms up and down in a straight line, it means, ""yes"". When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means ""no"". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side. Smoke signals The smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a tire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke. Ground-to-air signals It's a good idea lo build some signals, too. Use large pieces of wood to make the symbols . If you can't find any wood, use earth. Some useful symbols are: F ""I need food and water"" II ""I need medicine."" I ""I am badly hurt."" X ""I am unable lo move from here."" Pilots' replies If the pilot lowers the plane's wings from side to side, this means: ""message received and understood"" (At night, the pilot flashes the plane's green lights.) If the pilot flies the plane in a clockwise circle, this means ""message received hut not understood"" (At night, the: pilot flashes the plants red lights.) However, there is no signal which means ""message not received."	['wood of earth']
What's Michelle's impression of the people in Los Angeles?	Michelle was a student at University of California, Los Angeles. She is here to tell us how she feels about the city. What were the best things about Los Angeles? One of my favorite things about Los Angeles is the weather. I hate the cold and it never really gets that cold there. Plus, most of the time it's usually sunny, which is good because I love going to the beach during the summer. There's so much to do at the beach, but my favorite thing in L.A. was having a picnic on the sand with my friends. What were the worst things about being there? I disliked having to drive everywhere to get around because the city is so spread out. Los Angeles has a lot of traffic and sometimes it takes a long time to get somewhere close by just because the streets are so crowded. Also, a lot of people complain about the pollution. Did you have any problems there? Just the normal problems of living in any city, like watching out for pickpockets . Some people think Los Angeles has a lot of crime, but I think it's as safe as any other city. Also, many people think driving is difficult because there is a lot of traffic and road rage , but it just takes a little practice and a lot of patience. What are the people like in Los Angeles? There are all types of people in Los Angeles since the city is pretty diverse. For the most part, though, most of the people are friendly, calm and relaxed. Some people say that everyone in Los Angeles is beautiful, but I think that's just a stereotype . Would you go back to Los Angeles? Certainly. Los Angeles is one of my favorite cities in the world. I love the fact that it has all the nightlife and shopping of a big city, but also has access to beaches, parks, mountains and other places you can't usually find in large cities. Between the weather and the beaches and all the fun things to do, it's a great place to be.	['All sorts of people live there.']
What does UCSB research find?	"It has been known that the octopus has many special skills, such as using hard shells for mobile homes and protection, disabling their suckers, plotting escapes, and even predicting World Cup soccer game outcomes. Can't we say it is a mysterious creature? While all these talents are impressive, they pale compared to its ability to ""disappear"" from plain sight. Researchers have long known that this is possible because of the presence of the organs under their skin, which expand or contract to produce a series of color1s, patterns and even skin textures in just milliseconds. Scientists had always believed that such a reaction was directed by a signal from the octopus's large, human-like eyes or brain. But a recent report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology by researchers from the University of California at Santa Barbara, indicate that the animal does not have to wait for a signal from its eyes or brain. It can ""see"" the light with its skin! UCSB doctoral student Desmond and Professor Todd said they have seen reports about octopus skin changing color1s in response to light with no signal from the eye or brain. However, there had been no follow-up to find out why this was the case and the two decided to see what they could uncover. They began by taking skin samples from a couple of California octopuses and exposing them to color1s, ranging from violent to orange and found that their skin is equipped with the same light-sensitive protein as is found in the cells in the retina of the eyes. Thanks to these proteins, the octopus can ""see"" the light and react without having to wait for a signal from the eyes or brain, thus enabling it to begin the escape process. Another research by University of Maryland researchers discovered that cuttlefish and squid share the same talent. Thanks to these findings researchers now know that their skin color1 can be controlled by both. What is still not clear is how the two come together to manage the whole process. The doctoral student plans to get to the bottom of the mystery."	"['Octopuses can ""see"" things by using its skin.']"
It can be inferred from this passage that _ .	"America has been experiencing the longest economic increase in its history. Incomes have risen, unemployment has fallen, and cities such as New York are bursting with new office buildings. But just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel. Brown is homeless----one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street. During the day, Brown collects aluminum cans and sells them for five cents a piece. At night, he sleeps on the street. ""I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,"" said the 62-year-old former construction worker. Brown admits he had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine. But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement. He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available. However, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York. With the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand. A US report shows rents in New York City rose more than 27 per cent, from $549 to $700 a month. One of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up. The majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help. But few housing companies are building for the poor. Many small apartments in the city now rent for $1,500 a month or more. Brown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her. She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house. Smiling, he said he also has seven grandchildren whom he'd like to see more often. ""All I've got to do is _ ,"" he said."	"[""the poor can't benefit from the increasing economy""]"
Why did the Bulgarian boy shake his head from side to side?	"There was a Bulgarian boy who was an exchange student in the USA. He lived with an American family. One day, he went to his room in the evening, and did his homework. His host-mom came to him and asked if he would like to go along to the movies. He wanted to go, so he shook his head from side to side, said ""Yes"". His host-mom did a couple of steps back, and looked puzzled. She thought that he didn't want to go out because he shook his head from side to side. However, he wanted to go out to the movies. Bulgarians shake their heads from side to side when they mean ""yes"". People in other countries shake their heads from side to side when they mean ""no"". Gestures can have different meanings according to different cultures. For example, in America, putting your index finger and your thumb in a circle is commonly used as an OK sign that means everything is all right. However, in France, that sign is used to express ""nothing"" or ""zero"", which can have a negative meaning. Generally speaking, gestures are a type of communication that uses a part of our body, and when speaking with people from other cultures, gestures can be important keys or clues to understand them. However, we need to understand that those gestures vary from culture to culture, and it is necessary for us to have an open mind in understanding the different gestures."	['He wanted to go out to the movies.']
According to the passage, A Bite of China is _ .	"A Bite of China, featuring delicious Chinese food, has attracted countless viewers, and moved many to tears. A Bite of China is a serious documentary providing a unique view of Chinese as well as the relations between people and food and between people and society from the view of food. The touching documentary reminds some people of their mother, and makes some realize that every grain comes from hard and laborious work. Some people see patriotism in the documentary, and some consider it a great cultural export. How did this documentary achieve a great influence beyond its subject matter in such a short time? ""It is not empty propaganda about China's splendid food culture. Instead, it shows the techniques used in making food and their production process as well as the lives of ordinary people, thus striking a chord with the audience,"" an Internet user said. The success of the documentary should be owed to sincerity and reality. Nowadays, many works of art that have high investment, high technology, and magnificent scenes lack nothing but sincerity and reality. A Bite of China shows that a commercial documentary promoting patriotism can be full of touching details, that the emotions of ordinary Chinese people should be exhibited even in publicizing China overseas, and that even a completely commercial program can achieve both artistic and commercial success. ""We made this documentary with our respect and love for food,"" said director Chen Xiaoqing. Being sincere is the most important thing for artists because they cannot move others unless they themselves are first moved, and cannot convince others unless they themselves are first convinced. Sincerity is the ""secret"" for making this documentary so popular, and every cultural creator should learn from its success."	['a TV program']

What is the main idea of Para 5?	"The first day of school always goes wrong. For many students in the United States, however, this year it was even more so. It was all due to one extra school policy - they are now required to follow a new standardized dress code. According to the handbooks of all high schools in Allentown, Pennsylvania, students must wear short- or long-sleeve polo shirts and khaki or black pants. Skinny jeans, leggings and open-toe shoes are not allowed. Allentown schools are not alone. At Edgewater High School in Florida, shirts must have collars or sleeves, and pants must not sag and reach at least mid-thigh . No see-through shirts or T- shirts with references to sex on them are allowed. Overall, more than half of US public schools now enforce dress codes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 57 percent of schools now have a ""strict dress code"", up from more than 47 percent a decade earlier, USA Today said. Among young people, there are mixed emotions. Some don't mind wearing similar clothes every day while others aren't happy. Despite dress codes in many school districts, some students still come to school - even on their first day - in skirts that are too short, necklines that are too low and sagging pants that don't stay up on their hips. But there are punishments. If they are out of dress code, students can be removed from the classroom until they fix the problem. In Florida, wearing sagging pants is illegal for youths according to a state law issued in 2011. Breaking the rule results in not being able to do after-school activities, and even being forbidden to attend class. Some US schools go further and require students to wear uniforms. Many say that they simplify their jobs, saving teachers from having to punish students for wearing skirts or shorts that are too short, for instance. They can also prevent feelings of competition and envy among students. ""It takes away the daily fashion show and helps level the playing field a little bit with the haves and have-nots,"" longtime school safety consultant Ken Trump told USA Today. Critics of uniforms say they rob students of individuality. But for some people, that's a lazy argument. ""Clothing isn't the only form of self-expression. Students should know that it's what they do that counts,"" commented a parent named Beth Kassab in The Orlando Sentinel in Florida."	['How students responded to the code.']

When the University of Cambridge was set up, _ .	As the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is a unique and historic institution. There is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. From 1878, academic halls were established for women and they were admitted to full membership of the University in 1920. Five all-male colleges first admitted women in 1974. St Hilda's College, which was originally for women only, was the last of Oxford's single sex colleges. It has admitted both men and women since 2008. By 1200, the town of Cambridge had at least one school of some distinction. Then, in 1209, some scholars settled there. By 1226 the scholars were numerous enough to have set up an organisation, and seem to have arranged regular courses of study, taught by their own members. From the start there was conflict between the town and the students. Students, usually aged about fourteen or fifteen, often caused disturbances; citizens of the town, on the other hand, were known to overcharge for rooms and food. King Henry III took the scholars under his protection as early as 1231 and arranged for them to be sheltered from exploitation by their landlords. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. The current 168-acre campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. On April 29, 1911, Tsinghua Xuetang began its first term of study, and from that year on, the Tsinghua's anniversary has fallen on the last Sunday of April. Following the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, Tsinghua University, Peking University and Nankai University combined to form the National Southwest Associated University in Kunming. After the war, Tsinghua University moved back to its original Beijing campus.	['King Henry III gave much help']
Where is the book shop ?	Uncle Wang works in a book shop in the middle of the city. The shop is not far from his home. It is about one kilometer away. So Uncle Wang seldom goes to work by bus.

How did the author feel when working with his father?	"Sometimes the best advice doesn't come from a book, a microphone, from behind a desk in Washington or even from the people who are the leaders in their fields. Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day. The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed ""together"". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation. I now have my Dad's pocket Bible. It is one of my most treasured possessions, and it serves as a constant reminder of my dad's service to his country. However, it also serves as a visual representation of my dad's firm determination to keep his promises. Today, I place great value on my family and my faith, undoubtedly because of my dad's example. This lesson of promise has been introduced into all areas of my life. The third one is that listening is a way to acquire wisdom. My dad and I kept ourselves busy doing a lot of things together. During the nights of late summer, after dinner, the whole family would gather on our small porch to talk as the sun went down. Sometimes an aunt or uncle would drop by, and at other times my grandparents would be there. They would talk about the neighborhood news, the goings-on in modern Western society and politics -- mostly ordinary things, but it was good to sit there listening and to be together. Moreover, sitting there on the porch as dusk faded into night, I learned the value of listening and observing. Sometimes taking a moment to pause gives us the best perspective and sometimes we find the best answers simply by listening. Life in America becomes more complex. However, I like to think back to the simple lessons I learned from my father. They were the building blocks of my character and the values that still guide me today. Perhaps someone who has influence on your life taught you life lessons that helped form your character. I'm convinced that our nation could gain a lot by applying these lessons today. If we did, I think we would be reminded that the reason why our nation has become great is not merely that we have had wise leaders or well-spoken elected officials. Our nation has become great because of those ordinary Americans like my father, who have pride in their work, place great value on honesty, character and commitments, and pass those lessons on to their children and grandchildren. And that is the reason why we are still great today."	['Happy and proud.']
Philip's teacher teach students _ .	"Philip is a school boy. On his twelfth birthday, he decided to give up eating meat. ""I don't think it's right to eat animals,"" he said. ""They live on the Earth just like us and they are our friends."" Philip's parents were not happy about that. ""You are a growing boy,"" his mother said. ""You need meat. Do you want to stay short and be weak?"" His mother put some beef, rice and carrots in front of him. ""I want you to eat all your food now,"" she said. ""Don't leave anything."" Philip didn't want to make his mother sad. But he ate only the rice and the carrots. ""You're a silly boy!"" said his father. ""I'm getting very angry at you."" ""I'm sorry, Mum and Dad,"" answered Philip. ""I don't want you to be sad or angry. But I really don't want to eat any meat."" ""Then have some fish, dear,"" said his mother. ""Oh no, I can't!"" cried Philip. ""Fish are living things too."" ""Well, you can't have anything to eat at all if you don't eat any meat or fish,"" said his father. The next morning Philip got up hungry. His father walked to the school with him and asked to see the teacher. ""Is this what you teach the students at school?"" he asked the teacher. ""Philip refuses to eat meat at home. He doesn't listen to what I say."" ""I don't agree with Philip,"" replied the teacher. ""But I think he's brave to do what he thinks is right. We teach the students to do that."""	['to do what they think is right']
What is the skeptics' view of media violence?	"Nowadays people are troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies, television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what's wrong with a society that presents videos of violence as entertainment. Viewing large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality . Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: ""At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children."" Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out ""the most doubtful measures of aggression"", only 28% supported a connection. The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read ""aggressive"" or ""non-aggressive"" words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intention of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction. Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society."

This passage is mainly about _ .	"I once experienced an unforgettable trip to Gloucester to see some of the world's most beautiful and exciting animals in their own habitat , the North Atlantic Ocean. After a long trip by bus, we got on the ship. After a while, we stopped and everyone on the ship started to shout because we saw a humpback whale . It was wonderful. Sometimes, whales came so close to the ship that you thought you could easily touch them. While we were watching the whales, a guide was giving us some information about them. She told us that we saw only two kinds of whales -- 50-foot humpback whales (singing whales) and 70-foot fin back whales (the second largest whales on earth). She also said we could easily recognize a whale by its tail because every whale has a different kind of tail just like people have different fingerprints. They all have names, and on this trip, we saw ""Salt"" and ""Pepper"", two whales named by a biologist and a fisherman. They were swimming together all the time. I took twenty-seven photos, but it was very hard to take them because the whales were quick and stayed on the surface of the ocean just for a short time. It was really something. It was one of the chances that a person hardly ever experiences in life, but I had that chance."	['an unforgettable trip to watch whales']
According to the passage,an eye is like a camera because both	Have you wondered why you have two eyes and why they are set close together on the front of your face? The reasons are simple and important to the way you see the rest of your world. Your eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records it on film.Similarly,when you look at something,each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball.Because your eyes are set close together,they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to your brain, which puts them together into a single, centered image. Seeing in stereo means seeing with two eyes working together,which is called stereoscopic sight.This allows you to view the world in three dimensions,or 3-D.Seeing depth helps you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see and to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it.If images are coming from only one eye, however,only two of these dimensions-height and width-can be perceived.A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional,as in a photograph. Now consider why your two eyes are on the front of your face.Think of other animals with this same arrangement.They are all animals that hunt,like lions and wolves.Their eyes face directly in front of them.This provides a field of sight about 180 degrees wide,which is called binocular sight.On the other hand,animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head,which provides nearly 360-degree field of sight.In order to stay alive,they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind.However,without stereoscopic sight,they have difficulty determining how far a danger is. With sight both stereoscopic and binocular,humans share with animal hunters the ability to see from side to side and to accurately determine the distance.If you think it would be great to have another type of sight,perhaps with hundreds of tiny eyes like many insects do,think again! Each tiny insect eye sees only a tiny part.Besides,what if you needed glasses? Be glad for the eyesight that you have.	['can record images']
What Tommy said made the whole group _ .	"I believe children have a very pure sense of humor. Well, I would like to share my experiences with you. The other day when I was out with a friend and her daughter Jane at a restaurant, Jane ordered an apple dessert, which was the most attractive dish in that restaurant. However, when she had a bite of the pie, she shouted loudly, ""Mom, why does it look good but tastes like rubber?"" My friend was uneasy. Then the waiter gave us another dish. A child can say funny things. I was at a friend's home for tea and her son, Mark, wanted her to get up. His mom replied, ""I can't, because my foot has fallen asleep now."" Little Mark then sang a song and asked, ""Mom, will it wake up now?"" We laughed together. The other day we were having an interesting conversation over lunch and my friend, an animal activist , was arguing with another group member. Her son Tommy suddenly stood up, ""Mom, people should never be allowed to shoot extinct animals!"" That was funny and the child did manage to turn the argument into a pleasant conversation. Well, children sometimes really surprise us. I think we can have a lot to learn from them. They can help us understand the simple world through their eyes."	['have a pleasant conversation']

A group of 22 energy-saving policemen went to work last week in Beijing. They go around the city to see the use of energy in hotels, office buildings, shopping centers and other public places. One of their aims is to make sure that these places have set their air conditioning no cooler than 26degC. They also set up a special phone line so that people can tell them which buildings fail to follow the rule. ""If everyone sets their air conditioning at 26degC, Beijing will save 400 million kilowatthour of electricity in one summer. That's one-third of all the usages of the city in the season,"" said a TV advertisement. Other Chinese cities, like Wuhan in Hubei Province and Yangzhou in Jiansu Province, are going to follow Beijing's steps in setting up a similar police team. As one of the fastest developing countries, China is using a lot of energy. This has a great effect on the country's environment and limited energy. From 1986 to 2005, the country experienced 20 warm winters continuously . Numbers show that Chinese cities have to spend billions of yuan solving environmental problems every year. At the beginning of this month, China made its first action plan to fight pollution. It aims to reduce energy usage by 20% and increase renewable energy up to 10% from 7% by 2010. To introduce the public to a green life, last week Beijing held a show on energy-saving technology and productions. Environment-friendly machines, such as a vending machine that helps collect used bottles, have attracted lots of attention. ""We want to tell people that there are certain ways to protect the environment. Each of us can find effective ways to do it on our daily lives,"" said Liu Qianguang, an environmental engineer in Beijing."	"[""it's easy for one to do something good for the   environment""]"
Why did the Boones move?	"Some years went by. Then Father Boone called the family together. ""Pack your things,"" he told them. ""We are leaving here. Our farmland isn't good to live on. We can buy rich, cheap land in he southwest."" Sixteen-year-old Daniel was happy. ""I'm glad we are going,"" he said. ""I feel crowded here. There are too many houses and too many people."" Father Boone made ready for the journey. He pushed out the big wagon and tied two horses to it. Mother Boone packed clothes, dishes, pots and pans. She would make food for the family along the way. The family said goodbye to the neighbors and to their old home, and started. Mother, the girls, and the little children rode in the wagon. Father and the boys took turns riding the horses. Sometimes all of the Boones walked so that the horses could rest. Father and the boys had guns to kill birds and small animals for food along the way. The Boones traveled across Pennsylvania. At last the family came to the green Yadkin Valley in North Carolina. There were a few houses there already, but the farmland was much broader than that in Pennsylvania. Father Boone said, ""This is good farmland. We will stop here."""	"[""Their farmland wasn't good to live on.""]"
American children may spend _ hours in school a year according to the passage.	Do you like to sit in front of the computer and play computer games hour after hour? Have you ever thought of what that may be doing to your health? More and more children are becoming overweight and growing less creative because they spend too much time in front of the computer according to a survey. Last week Child Protective Services in America organized an activity. The aim of the activity was to encourage children to do some outdoor activities instead of playing computer games at home. Many American children spend about 1,000 hours a year playing computer games -- more time than they spend in school. As a result, they are overweight. Some of them have very poor _ , and they can't see clearly. Everyone should pay attention to his health and try to keep healthy. The doctor says that the longer children play computer games, the more overweight they may become. And the junk food children eat while they're playing computer games makes the weight problem more serious. To keep fit, children need to take exercise regularly, play outside with friends, and explore the world around them. Can you spend two weeks without playing computer games? It might be difficult for computer lovers, but why not have a try?	['less than 1,000']

According to the passage, which of the following is true about Brad Williams?	"Imagine being able to recall just about anything, your mind functioning as a nearly endless encyclopedic book of names, pictures, dates and events. Brad Williams' excellent memory recall makes him a personified version of Google. His wide memory allows him to recall almost any news event and anything he has experienced, including specific dates and even the weather. ""I was sort of a human Google for my family. I've always been able to recall things,"" the 51-yearold said on Good Morning America in his first television interview. Williams' type of detailed, complete memory is called hyperthymesia and few known cases exist. Brad's brain scan are now being studied by scientists at the Center for Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, at the University of California. At first, the drive-time radio broadcaster didn't think his ability to recall so much was anything special. Gradually, over the years, other people noticed how much he was able to remember in detail about events. Then in 2006, he read an article about a wman whom scietists called AJ, which _ Williams to come forward. AJ is a writwer of a medical journal, and the only scientifically-documented case of superior memory. ""When I read about AJ, my immediate thought was : Oh my God. That's Brad!"" said williams' brother, Eric Williams. Eric Williams is eager to learn about the inner working of his brother's mind. He is in the process of making documentary about Brad, appropriately titled: ""Unforgettable."" In the film, which hasn't been finished yet, Williams takes on a person who is Googling answers to 20 questions. He answers 18 of them correctly and is 11 minutes faster than the Google user. ""All of us have the ability to store this information, but the difference with Brad is that he can recall it,"" Eric Williams said."

What was the possible reason for the author's giving up the piano?	When I was six years old, my mother started making me take piano lessons. Every morning, she would make sure I sat in front of the piano and practiced for at least one hour. After two years, I still didn't like it. When the time for my Grade I examination, I couldn't go through with it. I cried because I didn't want to play the piano anymore. In the end, I was spared from going for any more lessons. That was the end of my music career. When I look back at that time, I ask myself--why did I do that for two years? I didn't think abut it then but the answer seems obvious now--I didn't think I had a choice. Then for twelve years, I felt that my life had no meaning. I felt that I really couldn't go on. I kept waiting for something outside of me to happen to make me happy. But the universe intervened and sent me help disguised in the form of a sales call. One afternoon a lady called me about a Tony Robbins event called Unleash the Power Within. Part of me was curious; but when the time came, I still was considering if I should go in or go to the beach instead. I made a choice to give it a try. In that hall filled with 4,000 people, Tony gave me back something I never knew I had---the power of choice. I left there renewed and refreshed, excited about my new life, knowing from that point forward that in life there are no victims, only choices. To this day, I sometimes wonder how differently my life would have turned out if I had missed taking that sales call. Sometimes in life, we are stuck in certain situations and it may seem that there is nothing we can do about it. Just remember that everything in life is about choice. You can make a choice to remove yourself from any situation that is not serving you right now. The question is---will you?	"[""He didn't like to play the piano.""]"
What is the best title for the passage?	"How could we tell time if there were no watches or clocks anywhere in the world? The sun is probably the world's first ""clock"", except in the far north, where the Eskimos live. There, it's dark most of the winter, and light most of the summer. But in most of the world, people have used the sun as a clock. Even today, if you don't have a clock, you can still know that when the sun shines, it's day and when it's dark, it's night. The sun can also tell you if it's morning, noon, or afternoon. Some people live near the sea from the _ In the daytime, for about six hours, water rises higher and higher on the beach. And then it goes down and down for about six hours. The same thing happens again at night. There are two high tides and two low tides every 24 hours. Seamen on the ship learn how to tell time by looking at the moon and the stars. The whole sky is their clock. In some places in the world the wind comes up at about the same time every day or changes direction or stops blowing. In these places the wind can be the clock. A sand clock is an even better clock. If you had fine dry sand in a glass shaped like the one in the picture, you would have what is called an hourglass. The sand in the hourglass goes from the top part to the bottom in exactly one hour. When the hourglass is turned over, the sand will take another hour to go back again"	['Different Ways to Tell Time']

""My teacher was angry and told me to see the headmaster after class,"" Peter answered. ""To see the headmaster?"" his mother asked. ""Why did she tell you to see him?""

"What does the title ""Surrounded by Brothers"" suggest?"	"I know it is wrong to envy your children. But when I see my son, Tonio and his younger brother Sam going down a slide together, one's arm around the other, I know I have missed something wonderful. Not only did I never have a brother, but also I had no friendships like theirs. My sister was old enough to help take care of me, so she was more a mother than a playmate, and I was more a _ than a friend. A brother would have been wonderful, but it was not in the family planning. Now I finally live with brothers, my sons, Tonio and Sam. I am watching them build the kind of relationship that I once dreamed about. They go to bed together. When one comes into our bed after a nightmare, my wife and I know that before morning his brother will follow. Sam manages the world with more ease than his elder brother, whose frustrations often bring him to tears. With a sincere ""Smile, Tonio,"" Sam is the one who comforts him. Tonio, on the other hand, has stopped playing with boys at his age who don't like playing with Sam. They are always backing each other up. I don't know what kind of relationship they will have when they grow up. Parents always want their children to have what they never could. I want them to have each other. So I imagine them going to the same college, marrying sisters and living on the same block. That's why I was so worried the day Tonio started kindergarten. I felt that I would lose something too. As we headed for school that morning, both boys seemed relaxed, as if neither had any idea that the day was going to be different, that starting then, Tonio would be leaving behind his brother, his best friend, his right arm. Tonio's first day was chaotic, with hundreds of children outside looking for their teachers. Before any of us could say goodbye, Tonio disappeared with his new classmates. He turned to wave and then was gone. It was so sudden. Sam even didn' t see him go. Although parents had been asked to ease the craziness of the first day by statying out of the school, I lifted Sam up and took him to Tonio's classroom, looking for a glimpse of Tonio. Sam spotted him first. My wife and I didn't head back home immediately, stopping instead at a coffee shop to treat Sam to hot chocolate. We even let him eat ice-cream with his fingers. Sam was still quiet, so I asked him if he missed his brother already. He didn't answer. Instead he asked, ""Daddy, is Tonio going to be gone forever?"" ""No, Sammy,"" I said, feeling happy about his sweet question. ""Not forever, just until three o'clock."" I sometimes think that the greatest thing I have ever done is to help create these brothers. And I didn't stop with them. We had another child, and for the third time in a row, it was a boy. It wasn't long before his brothers climbed into the crib to play with him. I am surrounded by brothers."	['The author experienced brotherly affection by raising his sons.']

Which may be the best title of the passage?	"In March 2012, researchers in the United States announce that they have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS. He says many patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections and that only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment. The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections that each hold a single dose of medicine. Mr. Farra says the device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug and that doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone. The seven women in the study were aged sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the dosage amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves. The microchips in the study held only twenty doses of medicine. Mr. Farra and his team are now designing a version that could hold a full year's worth of medicine. Robert Farra says, ""The new version may take us two years, and then we may be required to do two additional trials, taking about four years before the device is available on the commercial scale."""

I really want to get over it, but I just don't know how. What should I do? A shy girl Rachel Dear Rachel, The following ways may be able to help you out. To begin with, you need to SMILE to others. If you are meeting someone and they look scared and angry, would you talk to them? Probably not. This may be how people feel about you. If you are smiling and if your eyes are saying that you're happy to see others, the conversation will be easier for you and them. Next, do some volunteer work at school.

What is the main idea about the passage?	"The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs for moving cautiously. ""There's no prize for getting it quick,"" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. ""There's more of a prize for getting it right."""	['The Times to charge for frequent access to its web site.']
Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"A butcher watching over his shop was really surprised when he saw a dog coming inside the shop. He went over to the dog and noticed it had a note in its mouth. He took the note and it read ""Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please. The dog has money in his mouth, as well."" The butcher looked carefully and was surprised to find that there was really a ten-dollar note there. So he took the money and put the sausages and lamb in a bag, placing it in the dog's mouth. The butcher was so impressed, and since it was about closing time, he decided to shut up shop and follow the dog. So off he went. He followed the dog to a bus stop.

"People use ""in the pink"" to express they are in good health because _ ."	As is known to all, colors appear in every language to express people's feeling and thoughts.Then, what is the situation in American English? Red is a hot color.Americans may say they are red hot about something unfair.They are red hot when they are very angry about something.The small hot-tasting peppers found in many Mexican foods are called red hot for their color and their fiery taste.Fast loud music is popular with many people.They may say the music is red hot, especially the kind called Dixieland Jazz. Pink is a lighter kind of red.People sometimes say they are in the pink when they are in good health.The expression was first used in America at the beginning of the twentieth century.It comes from the fact that many babies are born with nice pink skin that shows that they are in good health. The color black is often used in expressions.People describe a day on which everything goes wrong as a black day.People or things on a blacklist are connected with things illegal now.But at one time, some businesses refused to employ people who were on a blacklist for belonging to unpopular organizations. The color green is natural for trees and grass.But it is an unnatural color for humans.A person who has a sick feeling in his stomach may say he feels a little green.A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green. Sometimes a person may be upset because he does not have something as nice as a friend has.That person may say he is green with envy.Some people are green with envy because a friend has more dollars or greenbacks.Dollars are called greenbacks because green is the color of the back side of the paper money.

Which of the following is true about vitamin D according to the passage?	"For hundreds Of years, scientists have been trying to answer what things have an effect on people's emotions . How you feel is controlled by many things. Your emotions can be affected by your personality, by the actions of others and by events around you. Perhaps you don't know your emotions can be influenced by the weather as well. People often say they feel good when the sun is shining and sad when it is cloudy. In fact, sunlight makes us feel good. When sunlight hits our skins, our bodies produce a vitamin. Vitamins are natural chemicals which we all need to stay healthy. Sunlight helps our bodies produce vitamin D. Vitamin D helps our bodies make a special chemical. This special chemical affects our brains and makes us feel happy. For example, there are long, dark winters of little sunlight in Sweden and Norway, so many people in these countries often feel sad. Without much sunlight, their bodies produce less vitamin D. Without enough vitamin D, their bodies make less of this special chemical which makes them feel good. To help the people in these countries feel better, special ""sunrooms"" with artificial lights have been built. People can go there and get ""sunlight"" for an hour or two! The weather can also affect people's emotions in other ways. Hot weather can make people angry because people feel uncomfortable when they are hot. In the same way, rain can make people angry because being wet can be unpleasant. As you can see, the weather can have an effect on the chemicals which control our brains. Through these ways, the weather can influence our emotions. Sadly, while the weather can change us, we can hardly change the weather."	['It is needed by us all to keep fit.']

Human beings have occupied major areas of land and transformed them into huge buildings, which has severely affected the environment and the natural habitat of bird and insects. Green roofing compensates for that. It creates a natural habitat for creatures like bees, grasshoppers and other insects. Modern roofs need a lot of energy to control the temperatures in winter and summer. However, green roofs reduce the amount of energy required for controlling temperatures, thus making them energy-efficient. As green roofing is highly energy-efficient, it can act as a encouragement for people who are interested in green roofing systems and their benefits. It will increase the market value of the building and fetch the owner a great share of profit. As the vegetation requires a water supply, there is a inbuilt water preservation layer in the green roof system. This layer helps to keep the rainwater. It makes full use of the rainwater and prevents wastage. During heavy rains, the water runs off the flat roof. The green roof prevents this overflow by slowing down the volume of running water. Green roofs can compensate for the lost greenery in urban areas and increase the artistic value of an area. Your building will look beautiful, coated with green vegetation. Green roofs can serve as local community garden and create a natural atmosphere, giving physical and psychological benefits like reducing stress levels in people and keeping them physically fit. Besides, people can start their own small-scale cultivation and experience the pleasure of gardening.	['it can save him spending a lot of money on energy']
According to the passage,what's the author's problem?	"Remember when a trip to the supermarket was nothing more than a boring thing requiring little or no specialized knowledge? You could send your kids into a cart while you did shopping. You always bought the same brands,usually the brands your mother bought. You didn't know about unit pricing,and furthermore,you didn't care. It never occurred to you to read the labels on anything. After all,you'd bought these things a hundred times. But now,I really look on those days with a feeling of yearn . How innocent we were! How carefree were those trips to the supermarket. No worries. Today a trip to the supermarket is filled with social influence. Every time I buy pork chops I think about the years I'm shaving from my life. I keep a careful eye on the freshness date and examine the tamper-proof packaging. I am victim of that most dangerous social disease:shoppers' panic. I didn't realize how serious my condition had become until the last time I needed laundry, soap. It seemed simple enough. Just run into the market,grab a box of the old reliable and pay for it. I hadn't planned on discovering Ecover,a new brand of laundry soap. It sat quietly on the shelf right next to my old reliable. ""Healthy,gentle but effective. ""My respect for it deepened with each new claim as I read the entire package. Then I looked at the price:$5. 69 for 2 pound. $5. 69! I cast a quick glance at the old reliable,still on sale for$1. 39. Six bucks for laundry soap! These people must be crazy! Who's going to pay six bucks for laundry soap? It's not as though I can't afford it. See,it's concentrated--use less,get more. BUT SIX BUCKS! And the box is made from recycled materials ...This act went on for a solid half hour,after which I left the shelf without any soap at all. Surely the meat department is most threatening place. Remember what protein was good for you? That's all over. Every bite you take kills you. I won't even mention meat's moral influence. When all is said and done,we still must eat. I gather up my healthy-cooking oil and my recycled paper towels and head to the checkout counter."	['She was greatly affected by the social influence.']
Which of the following can we infer from the passage?	"For some reason we were reminded that we primates need love. Kim Bard of the University of Portsmouth in England and her colleagues carried out a study on 46 baby chimpanzees orphans , which had lost their mothers. The study showed that primate babies that have tight relationships with mother figures do much better on cognitive ( ) tests than babies who only grew up with peers , but this is not breaking news. In fact, it ' s old news. In the 1950s, Harry Harlow did a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed. that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey. Harlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey ""mother"" with a plastic face. Then he equipped the ""mother"" with a milk bottle .The cage also had another wire ""mother"" who was covered with soft cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth ""mother"" arid only went to the wire ""mother"" to feed. Harlow's monkey experiment was important because, at the time, child care experts, and everybody's grandmother had a ""no touch, no comfort"" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies. They thought that babies should sleep alone to become independent, and for God's sake put that kid down. But Harlow's work changed that policy. Mothers were soon permitted to have their babies next to them in the hospital. The current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother's love doesn't just make for a psychologically healthy child, it also makes for a smart child. The highly raised chimps do better than those that are not loved, and the well-raised chimps do even better than human kids on IQ tests. We are primates, social animals which need love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time."	['Babies who sleep with mothers tend to be cleverer than babies sleep alone.']
What is right about happy?	"Imagine you are standing on the 70thfloor of the Empire State Building, staring at the cityscape. Suddenly a man pushes past you, opens the window and announces his intention to jump. You yell out, ""Stop! Don't do it!"" the six-foot-five figure turns to you and menacingly says, ""Try to stop me and I'll take you with me!"" ""Umm... No problem, sir. have a good trip. any last words?"" ""Let me tell you my troubles,"" he says, ""my wife left me, my kids won't talk to me, I lost my job and my pet turtle died, so why should I go on living?"" Suddenly you have a flash of inspiration. ""Sir, close your eyes for a minute and imagine that you are blind. No colors, no sights of children playing, no fields of flowers, no sunset. Now imagine that suddenly there's a miracle. You open your eyes and your vision is restored! Are you going to jump? Or will you stick around for a week to enjoy the sights?"" ""I'll stay for a week."" ""But what happened to all the troubles?"" ""I guess they're not so bad. I can see!"" "" _ "" If you really appreciate your eyesight, the other pains are insignificant. But if you take it all for granted, then nothing in life will ever truly give you joy. Actually, there are misconceptions on the road to happiness. misconception1: ""Once I know the tools for being happy, then it will work like magic."" Don't expect the results to come automatically. It is possible to understand how to achieve happiness, yet not put it into practice. In fact, many people actually prefer to be comfortable and unhappy, rather than bear the discomfort of changing their habits. Just as learning any new skill requires effort, you have to be willing to invest serious effort to achieve real happiness. Misconception 2: ""if I become content and satisfied with what I have, I'll lose my motivation to achieve more."" Now ask someone who is depressed, ""Let's go fishing!"" ""I'm tired. Maybe tomorrow. And anyway, I might rain..."" in reality, happy people are energetic and ambitious. There's never enough time to do everything they want to do. Misconception 3: A beautiful Sunday afternoon, you're in the park having a picnic with friends. Suddenly one person complains: ""who forgot the forks? It's too hot for volleyball. I want to go home already."" When our mood negatively affects others, we recognize we have duty to be happy and not spoil the fun. But what about when we're at home with our family? Or when we go into the office on Monday morning? like an open pit in the middle of the road, a sourpuss is a public danger. Being happy is part of being considerate to the people around us."

Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"In the animal kingdom, weakness can bring about aggression in other animal. This sometimes happens with humans also. But I have found that my weakness brings out the kindness in people. I see it every day when people hold doors for me, pour cream into my coffee, or help me to put on my coat. And I have discovered that it makes them happy. From my wheelchair experience, I see the best in people, bur sometimes I feel sad because those who appear independent miss the kindness I see daily. They don't get to see this soft side of others often. We try every way possible to avoid showing our weakness, which includes a lot of pretending. But only when we stop pretending we're brave or strong do we allow people to show the kindness that's in them. Last month, when I was driving home on a busy highway, I began to feel unwell and drove more slowly than usual. People behind me began to get impatient and angry, with some speeding up alongside me, horning or even shouting at me. At the moment I decided to do something I had never done in twenty four years of driving. I put on the car flashlights and drove on at a really low speed. No more angry shouts and no more horns! When I put on my flashlights, I was saying to other drivers, ""I have a problem here. I am weak and doing the best I can."" And everyone understood. Several times, I saw drivers who wanted to pass. They couldn't get around me because of the stream of passing traffic. But instead of getting impatient and angry, they waited, knowing the driver in front of them was in some way weak. Sometimes situations call for us to act strong and brave even when we don't feel that way. But those are few and far between. More often, it would be better if we don't pretend we feel strong when we feel weak or pretend that we are brave when we are scared."	['Weakness and Kindness.']
If we can't see our friends for a long time, we _ .	Friends are very important in our everyday life. Everyone needs friends. We all like to feel close to someone. It is nice to have a friend to talk, laugh and do things with. Certainly, sometimes we need to be alone. We don't always want people around. But we would feel lonely if we never had a friend. No two people are just the same. Friends sometimes don't get on well. That doesn't mean that they no longer like each other. Most of the time they will make it up and become friends again. Sometimes friends move away. Then we feel very sad. We miss them very much but we can call them or write to them. We can also make new friends. It is encouraging to find out how much we like new people when we get to know them. There's more good news for people who have friends. They live longer than people who don't. Why? Friends can make us feel happy. Being happy helps you stay well. If someone cares about you, you will take better care of yourself.	['can call them or write to them.']
Todd McHugh can be best described as _ .	"Todd McHugh doesn't think he is a hero, but police say the California teenager probably saved a mother and her two young children from serious injury or death last month. He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: ""Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed."" McHugh said he ""didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done."""	['brave and modest']
From this article, we know that _ .	I think lots of students like the pop singer named Jay. I also like him very much. Do you know as a boy, Jay was called _ . But his mother noticed that the quiet, shy boy seemed to dance well when he heard the Western pop music. His mother sent him to a piano school when he was four. When he grows up, he has an ability for playing the piano beyond his years. I learned to play the piano from 7 years old to 13 years old. I often feel bored when I practice playing the piano. But Jay was always crazy about playing the piano. I think he really likes music. He is my hero.. I admire Jay. The real reason is when the others all denied him, he never gave up. He tried his best to change his life. I think it is good for everybody. I hope that everyone can learn from him--try our best to do everything. Then I think we will be the winners.

According to Mr Dordain, how should they do to reduce costs?	The ISS project is a partnership of five - the US, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. At the moment, no program for its use nor any money has been put in place to support the platform beyond 2015. One of the biggest issues stopping an agreement on station-life extension is the human spaceflight examination ordered by US President Barack Obama. The Americans are developing a new vision for space exploration, and the rockets and spacecraft they will need to start it. The future of US joining in the ISS is closely tied to the result of the examination. Mr Dordain, the European Space Agency's (Esa) Director General, said no one partner in the ISS project could alone call an end to the platform. A meeting would be held in Japan later in the year where he hoped the partners could get something clearly going forward. He said it was also necessary the benefits were increased and the costs were reduced. Increasing the benefits could include finding new uses for the station. Esa has called for ideas on how to use the ISS as a platform for Earth observation . Mr Dordain said the agency had received about 20 very good proposals. On the issue of reducing costs, there were many ideas on the table, he explained. He also questioned whether it was necessary for the station to have six astronauts at all times. If there were periods when little maintenance was required or the experiment load was light, could the ISS run on a smaller group of people, he suggested. Construction of the space station should finish this year. Next month, two _ s built in Europe - a connecting node and a robotic control room - will be flown to the platform by the US shuttle Endeavour. Tranquility and the Cupola, as they are known, will complete the non-Russian side of the ISS.	['To have fewer astronauts sometimes']
Why did the author have himself trained on piano?	I am not just a successful architect . I also like to play the piano. In my spare time I often turn some dry musical symbols into beautiful music. Many years ago, while I was in a university studying architecture, I worked in a workshop. During the break I found an old piano in the corner of the room. With the allowance of the boss I sat down to have a try. Following my fingers the keys danced brilliantly and at the same time beautiful music flew out and then to every part of the room. All my workmates suddenly stopped talking and made their ears ready for my music. After graduation, I began to devote myself to my profession. All my musical talent was wasted into zero. Then one evening we went to a concert at which Mr. Stevenson, one of the ordinary workers in my company, sang us some beautiful songs. His musical talents made us all surprised. We all enjoyed ourselves with his beautiful voice so much that we even thought him a professional singer. I was also reminded of my musical talent. I began to train in a training center. My teacher was strict with me. He encouraged me to train every weekend and each time he asked me to play better than the last. Now I can proudly say I am also a successful pianist because every time I played on the stage fresh flowers and warm clapping would come from my audience. So I say, my friends, don't busy yourself with your work too much. Find some time to develop your potential talent and your life will become more wonderful.

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Twenty courses provided by 18 top Chinese universities went online on Wednesday, China's latest attempt to disseminate teaching resources within the nation and promote Chinese culture globally. These courses cover 20 subjects or lectures given by speakers and professors from several universities, including Zhejiang University, Nankai University and Wuhan University.Most of the courses will focus on traditional Chinese culture, according to the Ministry of Education. They are available through the websites of NetEase and China Network Television, as well as icourse.edu.cn, for free. Some of the courses will be translated into English and promoted across the rest of the world, according to NetEase Company, an international body promoting open content among the world's universities. The company has set up a translation team and ""will kick off the translation work when we finish the negotiation on intellectual rights with universities"", said Zhu Xirui, a senior manager for NetEase Company. ""We want to promote Chinese culture to overseas netizens through the program,"" he said. Ding Xiuhong, another manager of NetEase Company, said they had invested more than 15 million yuan($2.37 million)in the program. ""Although we haven't made a profit from 'the program, it will at least help increase our website's page views,"" Ding said. ""I'd like to watch the Chinese elite classes, such as Chinese literature and poetry, as well as economy,"" said Jeremy Scaramuzzi, a teacher at Tsinghua International School. He said he was also interested in Chinese classes on political science since that is the subject he majored in in the United States."	['the courses are given in Chinese at present']
Savini's works of art can be seen in all the cities EXCEPT _ .	"Some people make art with paint, and others use pencil or clay. But Italian artist Maurizio Savini prefers to use bright pink gum--after it has been chewed. Savini makes huge sculptures of bears and even people out of used chewing gum. Each sculpture requires thousands of pieces of gum. ""I like to use chewing gum because it seemed to me a material that can be used in many ways compared with those used by the conventional arts such as painting,"" Savini says. How does he do it? The process is a lot like working with clay. ""I work the chewing gum when it is warm and shape it with a knife,"" says Savini. Then, he puts a chemical onto each gum sculpture to make the gum stay in place. Savini's sticky art has been shown in cities like London, Paris, and Rome, where he lives today. Savini isn't the only artist to work with gum. His pink sculptures have inspired artists all over the world to get creative with the sticky matter. London artist Ben Wilson paints small paintings onto flat pieces of chewed gum he finds stuck to streets and sidewalks. In Canada, Jason Kronenwald uses different colored gum to make portraits of famous people. Kronenwald seldom chews gum himself. Instead, his friends help chew gum for him while he's working. ""At times it can make me _ , but I just pay attention to the colors I need and get the sculpture going,"" he says. In America, Jamie Marraccini's art depends on color, so he tests different kinds of gum before using them. To find out what color the chewed gum will become once hardened, he lets it age for up to six months. ""I've created 30 works totaling more than 35,000 pieces of gum,"" says Marraccini. That's a lot of gum! So think twice the next time you throw away a wad of gum. Maybe what seems like trash could actually be the beginning of a great piece of art."	['New York']
What is the passage mainly about?	Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go.	"[""Dyslexia -- a problem affecting one's reading and writing.""]"
What does Dong Qian do?	"Mo Yan,the winner of 2012 Nobble Prize for Literature ,is very popular around the world. He is famous as one of the greatest writers in china.

I want to find Mary _ .	"Mary Allen was my best friend- like the sister I ever had. We did everything together : piano lessons, movies, swimming, and horseback riding. When I was 13, my family moved away. Mary and I kept in touch through letters and we saw each other on special occasions- like my wedding and Mary's. Soon we were busy with children and moving to new homes, and we wrote less often. One day a card that I sent came back stamped ""Address Unknown"". Over the years, I thought of Mary often. I wanted to share stories of my children and then grandchildren. And I needed to share my sorrow when my brother and then mother died. There was an empty place in my heart that only a friend like Mary could fill. One day I was reading the newspaper when I noticed a photo of a young woman who looked a lot like Mary and whose last name was Wagman- Mary's married name. ""There must be thousands of Wagman. ""I thought, but I wrote to her anyway. She called as soon as she got my letter. ""Mrs Tobin!""she said excitedly. ""Mary Allen Wagman ""is my mother. Minutes later I heard a voice that was recognized instantly, even after 40 years. We laughed and cried and caught up on each others lives. Now the empty place in my heart is filled. And theres one thing that Mary and I know for sure: We don't lose each other again."	['all of the above']
The aim of the Healthy Families Program is to _ .	Health insurance can be very expensive. Some working people do not make enough money to pay for it. In the US there is a program called Healthy Families. This program offers people health insurance at a low cost. Families are charged about Y=7.00 a month for every child, and Y=10.00 for every adult. It costs much less than any other kind of health insurance. Having health insurance is very important. With this insurance, people can see a doctor when they are sick or hurt. The program is not expensive at all, but many people are still not enrolling in it. People say that it still costs too much money. They need all of their money to pay for things like food and rent. It would be great if everyone could have health insurance. People are working hard to come up with ways to make this happen. One idea is to make the Healthy Families Program free for some people. It is important for people to see a doctor when they need to. The Healthy Families Program makes it possible for more people to do this. Many ideas are being considered. Hopefully some of them will allow even more families to get health insurance. The Healthy Families Program is made to help those who don't have welfare and cannot earn enough to pay for private health insurance. It is an important program, but officials say that too many people are signing up for it and then dropping out because of the Healthy Families Program's cost.

What were Joe and Jeff?	"When this story happened, they were working around a very large house. Their job was to do the cleaning.

Suddenly somebody on the top shouted, ""Look out!"" But Joe did not ""look out"". He looked up. And as he did so, a long knife missed Joe's head, but it cut off one of his ears.

Jim Horne thinks that a 26-minute nap is not appropriate because _ .	"Air traffic controllers in the US have been advised to take 26-minute naps , after a series of accidents involving workers falling asleep. Now the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is calling for ""controlled naps"" during nightshifts . NTSB member Mark Rosekind said that a 26-minute nap would improve performance by 34%. He believes that beyond the aviation industry, other professions, such as motoring and machinery, also carry obvious risks. But other experts doubt whether 26 minutes is the appropriate napping time. It's a bit too long and risks you falling into a deep sleep, says Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Council. He said, ""A nap of about 15 minutes is best; once you get beyond 20 minutes, you risk a deep sleep and you can be much more tired when you wake up. Therefore, we suggest that a nap be combined with a cup of coffee so that you can enjoy an effective sleep before the caffeine takes effect in 20 minutes. However, this method only works on those who have had a poor night's sleep. If you haven't had a sleep the night before, this method won't be enough to make you fresh."" Health writer, Linda Wasmer Andrews, also believes that 26 minutes is too long. She says a nap between 10 and 20 minutes is enough, and the timing of the nap is also important. Putting your head down too early means your body may not be ready to sleep yet, but a nap that is too late in a day might make it harder to fall asleep. Early afternoon is often the best time, between l pm to 3pm, when people experience a post-lunch decrease in energy."	['people risk a deep sleep and may feel more tired']
On Boy's Day,you may not see _ .	On Boy's Day,children don't have to go to school.Every family with a boy hangs up huge carpshaped flags.The flags are usually three colors:black(representing the father),red (representing the mother)and blue(representing the son). Japanese parents believe that the flags will bring their boys good luck and give them courage and power. May 5th is Japanese Children's Day. But since the festival is mainly celebrated by boys,it is usually called Boy's Day. The celebration of Boy's Day has a long history.It is said that the festival is derived from the Dragon Boat Festival in China. On this day,Japanese boys eat a special kind of rice cake. It is covered with a leaf and filled with bean paste .Children love to eat it. And eggs on leaves are another traditional food. Japanese children are so happy that they have three festivals each year. In addition to Boy's Day,they also have Girl's Day and the 753 Festival. Girl's Day is the girl's festival on March 3. It is also called the Doll's Festival because on that day,families get a set of dolls at home for their daughters. It is celebrated because the parents want their daughters to be strong and healthy. The 753 Festival is for children aged three, five and seven years old. Japanese people think that these three ages are the luckiest ones in one's life. On that day, these children get special candies wrapped in beautiful bags.The candy is a symbol of a long and healthy life for these children. The 753 Festival falls in November.	['dolls']

The next day on his way to buy some chocolate, he saw a little girl crying sadly. The rich boy went up to her and asked what happened. The little girl said she couldn't find her parents. ""Don't worry. I'll help you,"" the rich boy said. So they went to look for them together. Finally they found her parents. They were so thankful for his help. After the rich boy arrived home, he looked in the mirror as usual. To his surprise, his face looked very happy. The boy understood the magic of the mirror. The mirror could show the true feelings of its owner. This was true--the rich boy helped that little girl, so he felt really happy. , ."	['A magic mirror.']

The name 'Mark Twain' was first used	Mark Twain's works are enjoyed worldwide. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens and he was born on November 30th, 1835, in the village of Florida, Monroe County, Missouri. After his father's death in 1847, Twain was apprenticed to a printer and wrote for his brother's newspaper. Later, Twain worked as a licensed Mississippi riverboat pilot, adopting his name from the call ('Mark twain!'--meaning by the mark of two fathoms) used when sounding river shallows. After the Civil War, Clemens brought an end to the steamboat traffic and moved to Virginia City. On February 3, 1863, 'Mark Twain' was born when he signed a humorous travel account with his new name. In 1864, Twain went to San Francisco to work as a reporter. He traveled in France and Italy and his experience were recorded in 1869 in the Innocents Abroad, which brought him wide popularity, and made fun at both American and European prejudices and manners. In 1870 he married Olivia Langdon. Together they relocated to Harford a year later. Meanwhile, Twain continued to lecture in the United States and England. Between 1876 and 1884 he published several masterpieces, including Tom Sawyer, the Prince and the Pauper, Life on the Mississippi, and Huckleberry Finn. In the 1890s, Twain lost most of his earnings in financial speculations and in the downhill of his own publishing firm. The death of his wife and his second daughter brought a sense of gloom in the author's later years, which is seen in writings and his autobiography. Twain died on April 21st, 1910.	['in 1863']
The thief stole the basket instead of the money in it because he thought _ .	There is a story of a country where the rate of inflation is so high that clever people pay for a taxi ride before, instead of after the trip. The story may or may not be true. But inflation was up so fast that by the end of 1923, they were 50 billion percent higher-- a rise of almost 2500% a month. There was so much paper money, and it had so little value that people carried bags full of money around to pay for things. One woman tells the story of standing outside a shop with a basket full of 500, 000 mark notes . She wanted to buy just one piece of meat, and she hoped she had enough money. But when she was looking, a thief robbed her. He didn't take her money; however, he threw it away and took the basket instead. At first workers demanded to be paid every day. But as the situation became worse, they had to be paid twice a day. but they had to run out and spend the money at once, or it would lose its value. People bought anything that was for sale but food was almost impossible to find. Farm workers refused to take money. They wanted to be paid in potatoes instead. New policies ended the inflation in 1923 when the government introduced a new money. But about half of the German people lost everything in those three and a half years.

What did Steve Jobs do when he knew he was dying, according to this passage?	Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, worked for more than a year to make plans for four years of new products that he believed would maintain the company's future. It was also revealed that Jobs fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style company headquarters in California. It will be big enough to hold 12,000 employees in a park-like setting near the existing base in Cupertino, the global headquarters of Apple. He appeared at a town council meeting in June to promote the planning. He was also overseeing the development of the delayed iCloud project, which will allow Apple users to store their music, photos and other documents remotely, and designing updated versions of the iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks, ensuring that at least four years' worth of products will go smoothly. Pre-order sales of the first official biography of Steve Jobs have increased by 44,000 percent. According to the official description, the book, out on October 24, 2011, is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years - as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, competitors and colleagues. Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011, aged 56, following a long battle with cancer. Jobs is survived by a wife, a son and two daughters. With his passing being confirmed, world leaders, the most famous technology bosses and thousands of fans throughout the world all paid tribute in their way to the life of the man they honored as a hero.

What do you think will weaken your ability to concentrate?	Are you afraid of tests? What will you do to prepare for a test? The following suggestions will be helpful. Pay attention to what your teacher gives about a coming test. Write down exactly what you will be tested on. Knowing what the test will cover is half done. Make a review list that includes important points from class and reading material. Then your studying notes will be in one place. What's more, rewriting the material will help you to remember it. Don't cram !Test preparation begins the first day of class, so keep on doing your reading and homework. Then you just need to review for the test--not learn all the materials. If you wait until the night before to try to learn everything, you will only put more stress on yourself. Get a good night's sleep before the test, but if you can't, don't be awake the whole night. Research shows that getting at least four hours of sleep produces the better test results. Eat a healthy breakfast to keep your mind sharp . Avoid sugar, as it will weaken your ability to concentrate .	['Taking too much sugar.']
What's the main idea of the passage?	Four years ago when I was a boy of 11, I got into the biggest trouble as a kid. It was a Saturday morning. Both my parents were out, leaving me and my 10-month-old sister home alone. Anyway, my sister was still asleep in her room. In fact I had the house to myself. I decided to do some drawing. Soon I gave up. Nothing was on TV, so I felt bored and touched the candles on the shelf ...I had an idea! What would happen if I set fire to some kitchen paper? Well, of course it went on fire, but it wasn't the tiny flame I'd expected, and I couldn't blow it out. I threw it on the floor, and then luckily got my dad's boots and _ it _ . I thought I was safe until there was a huge hole in my room. When my mum came home later, she smelt the smoke immediately. She dropped the shopping bag, luckily for me, over the hole. I thought this meant she would never see it. However, after running round the house checking for a fire, she of course picked up the bag and saw the hole. Next I was grounded and in trouble for months. Even worse, the hole was still there, reminding me of what I did. .	['The boy made a big trouble when he was 11.']

What's the main idea of the passage?	"Americans love their cars. There are more than eight cars for every 10 Americans, but most of the time, they sit idle , parked in a driveway or on the street. Now, several companies on the U. S. West Coast are helping people rent their personal car to someone else when they don't need it. Eric Loebel is one of those people. For a small price, he wants to let his Oregon neighbors ""borrow"" his car. It's a dark blue, model year 2000 Volvo car. The sales and marketing consultant says he doesn't use it much. ""My wife and I are huge bike commuters and almost don't need a car,"" he says. Loebel is one of the first car owners in Portland to list his wheels for rent through a so-called ""peer-to-peer car sharing"" service called Getaround. Com. ""Cars are so expensive to own,"" he says ""This can definitely offset some of the cost."" The website lets car owners decide for themselves how much to charge borrowers to rent by the hour, day or week. Person-to-person rentals began in Germany a decade ago, and there are a handful of similar companies in Europe and Australia. The concept caught on quickly in California over the past year according to John Atcheson, vice president of Getaround, one of four carsharing startups in the San Francisco area. ""We have had amazing cars leaping into our system,"" Atcheson says. ""Not just 1995 pickup trucks but we have had late model Mercedes, Audis, any type of car you can imagine. We actually have a Tesla Roadster--a $150,000 sports car."" Another service called JustShareIt plans to stand out by going beyond cars. Its founder says the company will offer person-to-person rentals of power boats, jet skis and snowmobeles( ) too."	['Americans try renting their cars to strangers.']

According to the author, the schooling framestudy often _ .	One is never too old to learn. Life learning (sometimes called un-schooling or self-directed learning) is one of those concepts that are almost easier to explain by saying what it isn't than what it is. And that's probably because our own schooled backgrounds have convinced us that learning happens only in a fine building on certain days, between certain hours, and managed by a specially trained professional. Within that schooling framestudy, no matter how hard teachers try and no matter how good their textbooks, many bright students get bored, many slower students struggle and give up or lose their self-respect, and most of them reach the end of the process unprepared to enter into society. They have memorized a certain body of knowledge long enough to rush back the information on tests, but they haven't really learnt much, at least of the official curriculum. Life learners, on the other hand, know that learning is not difficult, that people learn things quite easily if they're not compelled and forced, if they see a need to learn something, and if they are trusted and respected enough to learn it on their own timetable, at their own speed, in their own way--no matter what age and no matter whether we're at school or at home. Life learning is independent of time, location or the presence of teacher. It does not require mom or dad to teach, or kids to work in workbooks at the table from 9 to noon. Life learning is learner-driven. It involves living and learning--in and from the real world. It is about exploring, questioning, experimenting, making messes, taking risks without fear of making mistakes, being laughed at and trying again. Furthermore, life learning is about trusting kids to learn what they need to know and about helping them to learn and grow in their own ways. It is about providing positive experiences that enable children to understand the world and their culture and to interact with it.	['ignores some parts of the official curriculum']

Today she is using a new kind of tea for the first time. The husband picks up his cup. He isn't interested. He tastes his tea. Suddenly he puts down his newspaper. Something is different! Can it be the tea? He takes another taste. It's wonderful. He smiles. He looks at his wife and says in surprise, ""Doris, when did you cut your hair?"" Doris is pleased. She answers, ""Two months ago."" Doris asks, "" Herbie , when did your hair begin to become white?"" He answers, ""A long time ago."" Doris says, ""We have been together for many years, but we never cared about each other."" Now they aren't worried any longer. Breakfast is different. Has a new kind of tea changed their lives?"

When the author saw the homeless man, he was _ .	"I had made up my mind a long time ago that I would not give a homeless person money, because I could never be sure what that money would be used for.

I decided I would buy this man lunch. I bought a sandwich and soda. Just as I was leaving the store, two policemen were approaching the man. Obviously the shop owners had complained of his wandering and the police were there to draw him away from the storefronts. Just as they were about to wake him, I asked one of the officers if it was all right if I just gave the man something before he went. I was not sure why I asked the permission but the policeman said sure and I just left the bag in the man's cart, got in my car and drove off. As I was driving off I remember thinking ""I hope people saw that"". Then I had to seriously ask myself why I hoped people had seen me give the man a sandwich from Starbucks. Was it because I wanted people to think, ""She's such a nice person!""? Why did I hope others had seen me do it? I continued to wonder this all evening. The next morning, it came to me that I wanted people to have witnessed that small act of kindness not so that I would receive credit and praise but so that they might be inspired to do the same and in so doing that others still would witness their acts of kindness. Thus the whole spirit of pity and giving would be lasting."	['falling asleep']
What's the passage mainly about?	"Half of the world's population is affected by Asian monsoons , but monsoons are difficult to predict. American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. ""If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability."" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. ""There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive flooding."" said Eugene Wahl, a scientist with America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""So, to get a sense of what the regional moisture patterns have been, dryness and wetness over such a long period of time in great detail, I would call it a kind of victory for climate science."""

Which of the following is TRUE according to the author?	Many of us mistakenly believe that it's wrong to think we have any good qualities. We may spend a lot of time blaming ourselves for our negative qualities, thinking that self criticism is the key to improving our performance. However, a constant focus on our supposed shortcomings can stop our efforts to make friends with other people. How can we believe that others could like us if we believe our inner being is flawed? If someone seems to dislike you, the reason for that dislike might have little or nothing to do with you. The person who doesn't like you might be fearful, or shallow or busy or shy. Perhaps you and that person are simply a mismatch for each other at this particular time. Don't take yourself out of the game by deciding that your flaws are bigger than your good qualities. In fact, some of the very qualities you consider to be flaws may be irresistible to someone else. Although some factors that might cause one person to reject you, there are at least many factors that will work in your favor. You might be thirty pounds over your ideal weight, but you may have a wonderful laugh and a real enthusiasm for life. There are many people who don't mind your extra pounds. You may drive a shabby car, but you might be a great dancer and a loyal friend. There are people out there looking for loyalty, or fun, or sweetness, or wisdom, and the package it comes in is not important. If you are worried that you are not beautiful enough to attract friends, keep in mind that not everyone is looking for physical beauty in their friends. You can decide to feel inferior because you don't have much money and you don't drive a nice car. You can believe that this is the reason that you don't have many friends in your life. On the other hand, if you are very wealthy you may be suspicious that everyone is after your money and that nobody really likes you as a person. The point is that you can focus on just about anything and believe it's the reason you do not have friends and cannot make any.	['Inner qualities are more important than physical appearance.']

When the deed was done, the astronaut cleaned up with a piece of plastic attached to the inside of the bag, removed the bag, dropped a disinfectant pill in with the waste matter, and put the whole thing, sealed, into a special container. Donald W. Rethke, an engineer for Hamilton Standard Space Systems, developed a more private way to answer nature's call: the space toilet. It is somewhat like the kind of toilet one would find on commercial airplanes --- with unique adaptations for zero gravity, of course. For instance, it has thigh bars that keep the astronaut from floating off the seat. The astronaut (male or female) defecates in a bag and urinates in a hose. Solid and liquid wastes are kept separated because at least 85% of the urine is recycled and, yes, after careful filtration, used for drinking and other purposes. (Water is always in demand in space.) A vacuum sucks the waste materials into the toilet, where the waste is compacted into hamburger-like patties for easy storage. Although not exactly like an earthbound visit to the toilet, it is at the very least much more private than in the early days of space travel.	['a thigh bar']
According to writer, what most helps develop students' thinking?	"As a public school superintendent , I believe the best way to prepare students for colleges and careers is to focus on providing instructional programs and opportunities that help them become good thinkers. To do this, teachers and actually everyone else in a community, should play a role as a ""cognitive coach"" to students, helping develop good thinkers among our youth. The best way for you to become a cognitive coach is to seek out and engage school children and adolescents in meaningful conversations. The objective here is to get kids talking about what they think, how they feel, and what they believe whenever and wherever you may find them. It may be in a classroom. It may be at the grocery store. It may be at a basketball game. It doesn't matter where as long as you engage students in a topical conversation and, hopefully, even a debate. Mainly, you want to encourage students to voice their opinion about things. Get them to take a position on ""this thing, or that thing,"" and ask them to support their position with evidence. Curiously enough, the simple process of engaging students in real life conversations and debates will serve to strengthen what they have learned in the classroom, and help them create their own knowledge about a subject or a topic. Learning indicates that a student has been exposed to material, understands the material, and can recall the information. Knowledge, on the other hand, goes beyond recall and includes information processing, application to other situations, consideration of meaning, and contrasting with other concepts. Naturally, the topic of conversation you engage in with one of your learners will differ from student to student, and in the level of complexity based on child's age and developmental level. Even a kindergartener has an opinion about things that are going on in his or her life. Engaging in conversation with any members of your learning community in ways that get at what they have learned and what they know will help them develop higher order reasoning skills. A student's synthetic thinking process occurs when a respected adult asks a question, particularly a question that requires reflection. I think all adults in a community have a responsibility to help children with this process, with the goal of producing independent thinkers."	['Making evidence-based arguments.']
What color is Brooke Martin's dog?	"For 13-year-old Brooke Martin, seeing her golden dog Kayla has become much easier, even when she's not at home. Martin made a kind of machine--iCPooch. It allows pet owners to video chat with their pets and sends food from other places.2-1-c-n-j-y When a dog owner puts the iCPooch app on a phone, he or she can connect to the iCPooch machine at home and start talking. The owner's image and voice will be on the screen. When the owner pushes a button on the iCPooch app, the machine will give the dog some food that has been stored inside the box. How could Martin come up with the idea? The idea came to the Washington girl when she took a business class last year. That led her to think about helping her pet Kayla. Kayla always looked sad when she was left alone at home.""I wanted to know how you could talk to your dog if you were not at home. And what if you were able to give them a treat while you were away?"" Martin explained her idea. Now Martin and her family have set up a company. They've had investments from businessmen and asked a factory to make the product. They expected to sell 8,000 products by the end of 2015. Martin is satisfied with her success. ""A year ago, I never thought that I would be able to start a business, or even having an idea for a business,"" she said. ""I've learned that we are supposed to hold on to your dreams."""

The price of the answers for one subject is _ .	"For many years, the school students have to finish some homework during their winter and summer holidays. But with the fast development of the Internet, some students have found a new way to deal with their homework recently. Instead of finishing their homework by themselves, they ask the Internet for help. Since most of the holiday homework is the same from school to school, this makes it possible for some people to sell the homework answers on the Internet. Usually one must pay about 50 to 100 yuan for the answers for one subject of the homework. A survey shows that 90% of the students complain their homework is too much and they don't want to do it by themselves. To solve the problem, some schools have stopped using the standard homework and turned to other forms of homework. As for students, they must remember ""No pains, no gains"". If today they pay for their homework answers, perhaps one day they will pay more for their laziness ."	['about 50 to 100 yuan']
How did Rocky and Ethan learn CPR?	"Rocky Hurt and Ethan Wilson were playing football in their front yard in Marietta. Suddenly a woman they had never met ran out of her house shouting to them to call an ambulance. That woman was Susanna Rohm. Her 12-week-old baby seemed to stop breathing. She was so scared that she couldn't find her cell phone. so she had decided to rush outside to ask for help. After getting their parents to make the call, the two boys followed their mother to see if they could do anything to help. And help they did! As Susanna was trying to do CPR on her baby. Young Rocky came in and told her she was doing it all wrong. Instead he asked her to use two fingers, push on the chest 5-10 times. tilt( ) the baby's head. plug the nose and then do a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation ( ) by breathing into the baby's mouth. Luckily for him and the baby. Susanna accepted his advice for even a second and came a loud cry from the baby. Soon the doctors came and the baby was sent to hospital. The most amazing part of this story is that neither boy has attended a CPR class. Instead. They learned it all by carefully reading the posters on the walk of their school hall. And, while they are now being called as heroes and even interviewed on national television .neither really cares. They are just glad to have saved the baby's life!

Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?	"February has long been a month of romance. With the sweet smell of roses in the air, romantic films hit cinemas and love stories fill newspapers and magazines. On the 14th day, it is a custom for a boy to take his girlfriend out to dinner, buy her flowers and chocolates, write poems, sing to her or even spell out her name with rose petals! This is what you see on Valentine's Day, a day named after Valentine who was a priest in the third century Rome. When the emperor decided that single men could become better soldiers than those with wives, he didn't allow marriage. But Valentine continued to perform marriage ceremonies for young lovers in secret. When his actions were discovered, the emperor sentenced him to death. While in prison, it is said that Valentine fell in love with the daughter of his prison guard. Before his death, he wrote her a letter, which he signed ""From your Valentine"", an expression that is still in use today. Valentine died for what he believed in and so he was made a Saint , as well as becoming one of history's most romantic characters. Nowadays, Valentine's Day is also popular among Chinese young people. Some students are planning to make Valentine's cards for parents, teachers and friends. Others want to hold parties at which they will exchange small gifts and eat heart-shaped cakes. The idea is to have fun and encourage people to share in the spirit of St. Valentine."

Why did the author decide to introduce a new shop to his mother?	My mother once was a follower of traditional methods when it came to anything. She cooked traditional food, liked dressing up traditionally and thus was fond of traditional way of shopping. She loved going to the market and going from one shop to another to find out what suited her best. She could walk miles when it came to shopping along with her friends. She was familiar with all the local markets and shops and by now knows very well where she can get best discounts and material. However, now she begins to feel her age and gets tired when she goes out in the market. So one day I decided to introduce a new shop to her, a shop that is much bigger than her usual markets and where she gets better discounts. Yes, I am talking about the online gift stores. She has basic knowledge of computers and can operate a laptop. Initially she was doubtful about shopping from these online gift shops and wasn't too sure about the quality of the products. One fine day I decided to get some branded things for her first so that she could build trust in these shops. I ordered a Timex watch for her along with a Sisley handbag. She never bought things online but when they were delivered as a gift, she jumped for joy. She could not believe that I had ordered these gifts for her despite her being not very positive about online shops. However, after she saw both the products, she believed that these online gift shops would send the promised brand and products. She loved her new watch and the handbag. After this incident she ordered a gift for her friend's wedding anniversary. She chose a gift basket that could be made to her requirements. They sent a beautifully decorated basket with fine wines and chocolates. The basket was so carefully decorated that it immediately became her friend's favorite gift. Since then my mother has been often shopping online.	['She is too old to go to the market as before.']
It can be inferred from the text that _ .	"EBay will launch an online group gift-buying service today designed to make it easier for several people to chip in, buy and pay for gifts using their social-network and e-mail contacts. EBay North America Vice President Christopher Payne says it is going to be a major step forward in social commerce, which is the still-small practice of selling products through social networks.Online retail experts aren't as certain, but eBay says the new tool makes it easier for friends and relatives to chip in for gifts because it eliminates the headache of collecting contributions.It can also be used for family members to pitch in to buy, say, an expensive child seat for a mother. Anything on eBay that's available immediately, rather than up for bid, can be purchased this way starting today atgroupgifts.eBay.com.If members of an extended family wanted to buy a gift for one member, one person would choose a gift -- or have one recommended by eBay -- and invite family members to chip in using Facebook or e-mail.Those who wanted to join in would choose an amount to contribute (or agree to pay a requested amount) and pay using either PayPal or a credit card.They could also add a personal note. If enough people don't chip in, the organizer can ask people to contribute more or choose a less expensive gift. ""I see myself using this most in cases when I typically might not buy someone what they want because of price,"" says Nitzan Shaer of Boston, who was part of an online test of the site. EBay, with its 200 million products, millions of sellers and mobile commerce proficiency, is a logical place to pull together the products, groups of buyers and payment tools, Payne says. At least 12 sites, such as FrumUs.com and eDivvy.com, facilitate (,) group purchases but don't sell products.Although a handful of retailers, including Victoria's Secret and 1-800-Flowers, sell products through Facebook, Payne says he expects social commerce will take off as rapidly as shopping using mobile devices.EBay did more than $600 million in sales on mobile devices last year and expects mobile sales to increase to $1.5 billion this year. Although one in five consumers surveyed said they'd used Facebook for shopping in the past year, 88% said they would not be buying holiday gifts through a social network, mobile phone or smartphone.Of these, 26% were reluctant because of security or privacy concerns, and 20% were unclear about the benefits of using phones or Facebook to shop."

"Jose Andre Montano Baina was born and raised in the town of Totora, Bolivia-not exactly the home of jazz.But now he is taking the Bolivian and the world music scene by storm.He has already performed in some of the country's top occasions including the Legislative Palace and alongside famous musicians like Bolivian rocker Glen Vargas-what's so great about that? How about the fact that Jose is just seven years old and, has no vision! The young musician began to show his extraordinary music talent at the age of four when he started playing the-drums with a high standard of ability and skills, which are usually played by artists three times .his age.After mastering them, he quickly moved on to the piano and by the age of five had formed a jazz band!

How are the exhibits arranged at the World of Dali?	"Salvador Dali (1904-1989) was one of the most popular of modern artists. The Pompidou Centre in Paris is showing its respect and admiration for the artist and his powerful personality with an exhibition bringing together over 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and more. Among the works and masterworks on exhibition the visitor will find the best pieces, most importantly The Persistence of Memory. There is also L'Enigme sans Fin from 1938, works on paper, objects, and projects for stage and screen and selected parts from television programmes reflecting the artist's showman qualities. The visitor will enter the World of Dali through an egg and is met with the beginning, the world of birth. The exhibition follows a path of time and subject with the visitor exiting through the brain. The exhibition shows how Dali draws the viewer between two infinities . ""From the infinity small to the infinity large, contraction and expansion coming in and out of focus: amazing Flemish accuracy and the showy Baroque of old painting that he used in his museum-theatre in Figueras,"" explains the Pompidou Centre. The fine selection of the major works was done in close collaboration with the Museo Nacional Reina Sofia in Madrid, Spain, and with contributions from other institutions like the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg."

How did the writer feel when he told his father to sit on the side?	"When I was a child, our dining room had two kinds of chairs--two large ones with arm rests and four small ones without. The larger ones stood at the ends of the table, the smaller ones on the sides. Mom and Dad sat in the big chairs, except when one of us was away; then Mom would sit in one of the smaller chairs. Dad always sat at the end, at the ""head"" of the table. Sitting where he did, Dad was framed by the window through which the yard could be seen with its trees and grass. His chair was not just a place for him at the table; it was a place in which he was situated against the yard and trees. It was the holy and protected place that was his, and ours through him. After Dad retired, he and Mom moved out into a small flat. When they came to visit me at their old house. Dad still sat at the end of the table though the table was no longer his but mine. Only with my marriage to Barbara, did I hear a voice questioning the arrangement. She requested, gently but firmly, that I sit at the head of the table in our home. I realized then that I was head of the family, but I also felt unwilling to introduce such a change. How would I feel sitting in that ""head"" place in my Dad's presence? And how would he handle it? I was to find out on the occasion of our youngest child's first birthday. Mom and Dad arrived for lunch, and went into the dining room. Dad moved toward his usual seat in front of the window. Before he could get around the side of the table, I took a deep breath and said, ""Dad, this is going to be your place, next to Mom, on the side."" He stopped, looked at me and then sat down. I felt sad, and angry at Barbara for pushing me to do this. It would have been easy to say, ""My mistake, Dad. Sit where you always sit."" But I didn't. When he and Mom were seated, Barbara and I took our places. I don't know how Dad felt. I do know that, though removed from his usual place, he continued to share his best self with us, telling stories of his childhood and youth to the delight of his grandchildren. As I served the food, our lives experienced a change, which we continue to live with. It wasn't easy, but I sense that there is also something good in the change which has occurred. I am beginning to learn that ""honoring one's father"" is more than the question of which place to occupy at the dining table. It also means listening, wherever we sit and whatever positions we own, to the stories Dad longs to tell. We may then, during these magical moments, even be able to forget about whose chair is whose."	['He regretted what he had done and wanted to blame his wife.']
We should leave a hole in the front of the nest so that _ .	"If we find a bird nest, we will have a good place of observing and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their baby birds from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, mothers often leave and come back to the nest during the time to look for food. So it is good to observe birds. When we observe birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how to make a bird nest? It's very easy. If you want to make one, please follow these: Making a nest: A good nest must be very fine, strong, thick and easy. a) Each nest must have six boards. Don't make the boards too slippery. [:Zxxk.Com] b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a door. The ""door"" is from 3cm to 5cm. So the bird can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater doesn't go into the nest. d) One piece of the boards should be easy to open. e) Please don't forget to color the nest."

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"One bitterly cold day, a snowstorm blew into our area. Needing firewood, I quickly set out with my best friend, Bruce, to look for a tree to cut down. I was glad to have Bruce along. Cutting down a tree in a snowstorm can be dangerous. So it was important to have a friend who could warn me of dangers. When I chose a big 23-meter-tall tree and prepared to cut it down, my best friend suddenly warned me, ""Don't cut down that tree! It's too close to the power line!"" I wasn't sure about it. So I decided to _ his warning. I wanted to finish the job quickly and go home. So I began cutting down the tree. When the tree fell, there was no longer any doubt that my friend was right. The tree caught the power line, bringing it to the ground. I considered cutting the tree off the line. After all, electricity can't travel through wood, so I could safely remove the tree. As I reached out my finger to touch the tree, pain ran up my arm and through my head. I had been shocked! After I returned home and told my mother what had happened, she quickly called the power company. Workers from the power company soon arrived on the scene. One of them asked if I had touched the tree, and when I told him I had, his face turned pale. ""You should have been killed,"" he said. So why am I still alive? It was my boots that saved my life. Within two hours, the workers removed the tree. Soon the snowstorm calmed down--but not my mother. Even though she was glad I wasn't hurt, my mother was well serious with me. After all, I shouldn't have brushed off my friend's warning. Through this experience, I learned that it's important to listen to people who offer a different perspective . Taking the time to listen might actually save a lot of time and trouble. It certainly would have kept me from getting the ""shock of my life""."	['The writer knew nothing about electricity.']
One of the two ways the writer suggests for us to get along with others is to _ .	For a long time being happy was considered something that just happened, and there was nothing special about it. Now we know that getting along with other people is something that we can work at. It is possible to act in such a way that other people will like us better. One way is being unselfish, not wanting everything from our friends. Another way is to look for good points, not bad points in other people. It is surprising how successful this treasure hunt can be. You do not have to be spineless in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights . But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers and especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you. Some day, things may turn out all right when you have to learn to get along the best with the situation, without thinking too much about it. Worrying never helps in a situation you cannot change.

Why was the author upset in fishing trips when he was nine?	"When I was nine years old, I loved to go fishing with my dad. But the only thing that wasn't very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn't catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, ""Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish"", I remember being even more upset then because, ""I'm not a fish!"" I didn't know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does? As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don't have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes... The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them.. When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, ""We all need to think like sales people."" But it didn't completely make sense. My dad never once said, ""If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman."" What he said was, ""You need to think like a fish."" Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters."	['He could not catch a fish.']
Which two planets make the longest trips around the sun among all the planets in the solar system?	The earth is not the only body that travels around the sun. With it are eight other planets, fellow members of the sun's family. Two of them, Mercury and Venus, are nearer while the other six, namely Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, also in their given order from the sun, are farther from the sun than the earth is. The farther they are, the longer trips they make around the sun. People noticed long ago that these traveling bodies moved around in the sky in definite paths. It is a force called gravity that holds them in their paths. We know that every little bit of matter in the universe pulls upon every other bit of matter. The pull between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses. Because the sun is so large the pull between the sun and the planets are thus great. If it were not for this pull, the planets would fly off into space. In the same way there exists a pull between the earth and the moon, which keeps the moon traveling in its orbit around our planet, the earth. Gravity holds you to its surface, and pulls back to it the ball which you throw into the air. Of course the ball also pulls on the larger earth but the earth is so much larger that the pull is not noticed. Now remember that large bodies exert a greater pull than smaller ones which contain less material. But each object in the universe, no matter how small, pulls on all other objects to some degree.	['Neptune and Pluto.']
Sir Steve Redgrave suggests that _ .	"The education of thousands of children with reading and sight trouble is being held back because of a lack of awareness of their legal rights, say campaigners. They are calling for greater efforts to increase awareness of the rights of such children to have text books in design other than standard print. The campaign is being supported by five times Olympic gold medalist, Sir Steve Redgrave, who has reading trouble. Pupils have the right to receive text in another way, and parents can take action under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) if they feel their children are being treated in a different way through a lack of support. But new research suggests 89 per cent of print disabled pupils and their parents are unaware of software which changes standard print into other substitutes like combined text and audio files which can be read or listened to. Sir Steve has teamed up with software company Dolphin Computer Access to raise awareness of software turning tools. He said: ""I recognize that schools have competing priorities for their resources , but I would like to see a much greater effort on the part of the government and schools to raise awareness among parents that these additional solutions exist and that their children have a right to use them."" Mike Foster, Dolphin's local MP in Worcester, is _ the campaign. ""There is clearly an issue to solve concerning software for special needs. I'll be asking ministers what steps can be taken to improve the situation"", he said."	"[""government and schools raise awareness of disabled children's legal rights""]"
What might the man be?	"A young woman was driving through the lonely countryside. It was dark and raining. Suddenly she saw an old woman by the side of the road, holding her hand out as if she wanted a lift. ""I can't leave her out in this weather,"" the woman said to herself, so she stopped the car and opened the door. ""Do you want a lift?"" she asked. The old woman nodded and climbed into the car. After a while, she said to the old woman, ""Have you been waiting for a long time?"" The old woman shook her head. ""Strange,"" thought the young woman. She tried again. ""Bad weather for the time of year,"" she said. The old woman nodded. No matter what she said, the hitchhiker gave no answer except for a nod of the head or a shrug. Then the young woman noticed the hitchhiker's hands which were large and hairy. Suddenly she realized that the hitchhiker was actually a man! She stopped the car. ""I can't see out of the rear screen,"" she said. ""Would you mind clearing it for me?"" The hitchhiker nodded and opened the door. As soon as the hitchhiker was out of the car, the terrified young woman raced off. When she got to the next village she pulled up. She noticed that the hitchhiker had left his handbag behind. She picked it up and opened it. She gave a gasp -- inside the bag was a gun."	['a robber']
Positive choice of words helps kids to _ .	"It is not only praise or punishment that determines a child's level of confidence. There are some other important ways we shape our kids--particularly by giving instructions and commands in a negative or positive choice of words. For example, we can say to a child ""Don't run into traffic!"" or ""Stay on the footpath close to me."" In using the latter, you will be helping your kids to think and act positively, and to feel competent in a wide range of situations, because they know what to do, and aren't scaring themselves about what not to do. Why does such a small thing make a difference? It is all in the way the human mind works. What we think, we automatically rehearse. For example, if someone offered you a million dollars not to think of a blue monkey for two minutes, you wouldn't be able to do it. When a child is told ""Don't fall off the tree,"" he will think of two things: ""don't"" and ""fall off the tree"". That is, he will automatically create the picture of falling off the tree in his mind. A child who is vividly imagining falling off the tree is much more likely to fall off. So it is far better to use ""Hold on to the tree carefully."" Clear, positive instructions help kids to understand the right way to do things. Kids do not always know how to be safe, or how to react to the warning of the danger in negative words. So parents should make their commands positive. ""Sam, hold on firm to the side of the boat"" is much more useful than ""Don't you dare to fall out of the boat?"" or worse still ""How do you think I'll feel if you drown?"" The changes are small but difference is obvious. Children learn how to guide and organize themselves from the way we guide them with our words, so it pays to be positive."

Which of the following is NOT a reason for a water crisis?	"Everyone needs safe drinking water, but about 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water. Most of the world's water is salty ocean water or frozen polar ice. By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes. Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. ""You do the math, and it gets a little scary,"" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. ""We're waking up,"" he says. ""But not fast enough."" In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a $1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further. Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days. City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002.

What does the writer mainly want to tell us in this passage?	"Every year, as Spring Festival draws near, most Chinese people will get excited to make preparation for the most important festival and make plan for the winter break. It is a little like Christmas in the United States, but there are some differences between the two festivals. Both the major Chinese and the major Western holidays come during the cold season, and special food is expected. In western countries, cookies and cakes begin just after Thanksgiving in November and show up everywhere. Turkey, potatoes and other food come later. Similar thing happens in China. Entering lunar December, most families will make shopping plans for _ and food is certainly one of the most important things to be considered. At the end of the month, both parents in each family will be very busy---the father is busy buying food while the mother is busy cooking. A deeper similarity is tradition. Christmas, as the letters ""Christ"" suggests, began as a holiday to celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ. Many people pray on this day. In China, people living in cities or towns, though they don't plan to sow seeds this month, still celebrate on the big day for farmers. Followers of both holidays are also different from each other. While Chinese people travel to the homes of elder relatives, Americans usually call or send cards. Westerners prefer Christmas carols to fireworks. In Christmas, many family gifts come together instead of one by one, since adults may have only one day free to celebrate. But the most curious difference is about students. Chinese students going home for Spring Festival sometimes report that they get bored by the end of vacation, yet American students seldom get bored around Christmas and western New Year. Not everyone enjoys classic holiday traditions. Students in western countries may get upset, as too much homework, travel or bad family relations may destroy the short holiday season. In China, more and more college students choose to travel or work during the winter holiday instead of going home to stay with their families. It's against the tradition but many people accept it."

What prevents many Americans practicing better food safety in their kitchen?	"WASHINGTON---Think you're savvy about food safety? That you wash your hands well, scrub away germs, cook your meat properly? Guess again. Scientists put cameras in the kitchens of 100 families in Logan, Utah. What was caught on tape in this middle-class, well-educated college town suggests why food poisoning hits so many Americans. People skipped soap when hand-washing. Used the same towel to wipe up raw meat juice as to dry their hands. Made a salad without washing the lettuce. Undercooked the meat loaf. One even tasted the marinade in which bacteria-ridden raw fish had soaked. Not to mention the mom who handled raw chicken and then fixed her infant a bottle without washing her hands. Or another mom who merely rinsed her baby's juice bottle after it fell into raw eggs---no soap against the salmonella that can lurk in eggs. ""Shocking,"" was Utah State University nutritionist Janet Anderson's reaction. Specialists call this typical of the average U.S. household: Everybody commits at least some safety sins when they are hurried, distracted by fussy children or ringing phones, simply not thinking about germs. Even Anderson made changes in her kitchen after watching the tapes. The Food and Drug Administration funded Anderson's $50,000 study to detect how cooks slip up. The goal is to improve consumers' knowledge of how to protect themselves from the food poisoning that strikes 76 million Americans each year. ""One of the great barriers in getting people to change is they think they're doing such a good job already,"" said FDA consumer research chief Alan Levy. Surveys show most Americans blame restaurants for food-borne illnesses. Asked if they follow basic bacteria-fighting tips---listed on the Internet at www.fightbac.org---most insist they're careful in their kitchens. Levy says most food poisonings probably occur at home. The videotapes suggest why. People have no idea that they're messing up, Anderson said. ""You just go in the kitchen, and it's something you don't think about."" She described preliminary study results at a food meeting last week. Having promised the families anonymity, she didn't show the tapes. For $50 and free groceries, families agreed to be filmed. Their kitchens looked clean and presumably(perhaps) they were on their best behavior, but they didn't know it was a safety study. Hoping to see real-life hygiene, scientists called the experiment ""market research"" on how people cooked a special recipe. Scientists bought ingredients for a salad plus either Mexican meat loaf, marinaded halibut or herb-breaded chicken breasts with mustard sauce---recipes designed to catch safety slip-ups. Cameras started rolling as the cooks put away the groceries. There was mistake No. 1: Only a quarter stored raw meat and seafood on the refrigerator's bottom shelf so other foods don't get contaminated by dripping juices. Mistake No. 2: Before starting to cook, only 45 percent washed their hands. Of those, 16 percent didn't use soap. You're supposed to wash hands often while cooking, especially after handling raw meat. But on average, each cook skipped seven times that Anderson said they should have washed. Only a third consistently used soap---many just rinsed and wiped their hands on a dish towel. That dish towel became Anderson's nightmare. Using paper towels to clean up raw meat juice is safest. But dozens wiped the countertop with that cloth dish towel---further spreading germs the next time they dried their hands. Thirty percent didn't wash the lettuce; others placed salad ingredients on meat-contaminated counters. Scientists checked the finished meal with thermometers, and Anderson found ""alarming"" results: 35 percent who made the meat loaf undercooked it, 42 percent undercooked the chicken and 17 percent undercooked the fish. Must you use a thermometer? Anderson says just because the meat isn't pink doesn't always mean it got hot enough to kill bacteria. Anderson's study found gaps in food-safety campaigns. FDA's ""Fight Bac"" antibacterial program doesn't stress washing vegetables. Levy calls those dirty dish towels troubling; expect more advice stressing paper towels. Anderson's main message: ""If people would simply wash their hands and clean food surfaces after handling raw meat, so many of the errors would be taken care of."""

Cai Yong decided to work as _ .	"Few students would dream of getting a job as a shoe shiner working along the street. College students, in their own eyes and in the eyes of the public, are expected to get at least a proper job, if not working in a high-income or white-collar position. Cai Yong's decision to work as a shoe shiner shocked not only his parents, who had high hopes for him, but also his girlfriend. ""It is right for young graduates to be ambitious . But they have to start in a solid and down-to-earth way,"" Cai said. Cai is not alone in making such a choice. The company has got 12 college students in all. ""I come for the 800yuanmonthly pay,"" said Xiao Ji, who is a student from Nanjing University. ""I have grown up and no longer live on my parents,"" he said. ""Working as shoe shiners can mean a bright future,"" Cai said. Not everyone can accept this job choice. Cai's girlfriend left him because she felt ashamed to be with a shoe shiner, and Cai accepted the fact. ""This is the price to be paid for a job,"" he said. A former shoe shiner, Zhong Haibo, from a medical college, believes it was a good training for the rest of his life. ""There is nothing I can't do after working as a shoe shiner,"" Zhong said, meaning that such kind of experience in early life is helpful in a future job."	['a shoe shiner']

Why does Wang Baoqiang leave for Shaolin Temple at his early age?	"Some years ago, Wang Baoqiang was a nobody to most Chinese people. However, he is now a household film star in China. Wang is the youngest child of a poor family in Hebei Province. Dreaming of becoming an actor, he left home at the age of 8 to study kung fu at Shaolin Temple, since kung-fu actors seemed to appear most often on the big screen. At 14, he moved to Beijing for his acting career for the first time, with little money in his pocket. He worked at a construction site for 20 to 25 yuan per day, and spent his free time standing in front of the Beijing Film Studio, eager to be chosen as temporary actors. This was the hardest time for the boy. His opportunity finally came one day after he went for a role in the movie ""Blind Shaft"" . He was chosen to play a young coal miner. The movie won him three prizes in Thailand, France and Taiwan. But his success didn`t make any difference to his life. That year, he went home for the Spring Festival. He gave his family his earnings from the movie, around $ 250 and then returned to Beijing with 500 yuan, the same amount he had when he first came to the city. His life was as simple as before. Thanks to his natural performance in ""Blind Shaft"", he was invited by the famous director Feng Xiaogang to act in the film ""A World Without Thieves"" in 2004, which made him famous immediately. People called him ""Shagen"", the name of his character in the movie. Wang's work, ""Soldiers Sortie"" has made him the most popular actor on the Chinese mainland. For the actor, it's a dream coming true. ""Dreams come true. I think my life is exactly a course of pursuing dreams. No matter how tough one thing is,I can make it as long as I put great effort into it. ""he said."	['To realize his childhood dream to be an actor']
The purpose of writing the text is to tell us _ .	"One day I went to a store with a list. ""Excuse me,"" I said. A lady with glasses looked up, saying, ""I'm Miss Bee. Come closer and let me look at you. I want to be able to describe you to the police if something is missing from the store."" ""I'm only a little girl, not a thief !"" I was surprised. ""But I think you're potential ,"" she said. ""I need these,"" I said, holding up my list. ""So what? I am not a person who works for you. Go to get them."" she said. The store was a puzzle to me. It took me two hours to find everything on the list. ""That packet of beans is only 29 cents, but you asked me for 35 cents. "" I corrected her. She didn't seem unhappy, just looked at me over her glasses. The following summer I visited Miss Bee some times a week. She always found ways to fool me. Or shortly after I remembered the places of something on the shelf, she arranged the shelves again and made me hunt for them again. By the end of the summer the shopping trip that had once taken me an hour was done in 15 minutes. One morning I was to get a packet of chocolate. ""Miss Potential, what did you learn this summer?"" she said. ""That you're a meanie !"" I answered angrily. But she laughed, ""Well, I believe my job is to teach every child I meet life lessons to help them. When you get older, you'll be glad our paths crossed!"" Glad I met Miss Bee? Ha! It was _ . Until one day my daughter said, "" Could you finish my math problems for me?"" ""How will you ever learn to do it yourself if I do it for you?"" I said. Suddenly, I was back at that store where I had learned the hard way to check my bill. Now I have known what Miss Bee did for me. She is my good teacher."

The writer had to walk to school because _ .	"One morning, it was already a quarter to eight when I got up. I was afraid that I would be late so I put on my clothes hurriedly and left without breakfast. There were so many people at the bus stop that it was not easy to catch a bus. Five minutes went by, I still couldn't get on one. The only thing I could do was to walk. I rushed through the crowded and ran towards my school. Unexpectedly, I hit an old woman, and she fell down. Without saying sorry, I left her and went on my way. That evening, when I was back from school, I learned that the old woman was badly hurt in the leg from the fall. Some kind people sent her to a hospital after I left. I felt very sorry and nearly cried. The only way for me to ask her pardon was to pay her a visit. The next day, I went to the hospital, I met the old woman and told her who I was. At first I thought that she would give me _ To my surprise, she didn't, but smiled. For me, that smile was worse. She touched my hand and said, ""Never mind, my girl, I knew you didn't want to hurt me, did you? Don't worry, I will be better soon."""	['it was difficult to get on']
Which is NOT TRUE according to the passage?	"As a parrot. Blu was special for two reasons. First , he had bright blue feathers . He was a rare species of bird . Second, Blu couldn't fly.

Which of the following is true about the pulses of heat in the study?	If you touch your finger to a hot stove, you know it's going to hurt. However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments.	['Each heat pulse lasted for 20 seconds.']
We can know from Paragragh 2 that Garcia Marquez _ .	"Gabriel Garcia Marquez ,who was awared the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982,passed away at the age of 86 on April 17,2014. The world paused to remember the cultural giant . Garcia Marquez was born in Colombia ,but he spent most of his adult life in Mexico City . As one of the most famous writers ,he was widely regarded as ""a giant of 20th-century literature "" . Garcia Marquez wrote in a style called ""magical realism ""In such works,people live a daily life in a certain period of time in history . But meanwhile ,magical things happen to them . Garcia Marquez is best known for his 1967 novel ,One Hundred Years of Solitude ,which has sold about 50 million copies . It tells the tale of the small and _ town of Macondo which was separated from the outside world -of its founding and its troubled history over a hundred years .

People who make beautiful things are usually called _ .	The hand, the eyes, and the brain work together to make human beings different from other animals. No other animals have all three parts to work together. No animals can do what human beings can do. Humans can do many things and feel many things with the hand. The hand can hold onto things and make things because the thumb works with the fingers. This fifth finger is strong. Most animals don't have thumbs. The thumb can press against the other fingers. Without a thumb to press against the fingers, it is difficult to hold onto anything. The thumb and fingers can also fit the flat surface of a box and the curved surface of a pencil. We can feel that something is hot or cold, soft or hard, smooth or rough. The hand, with thumb and fingers, is one of the best tools we have. Most animals see a flat picture. Their eyes can only see how high and how wide something is. Some animals see a different picture with each eye. Some don't see in colour. Humans see one picture with both eyes working together. We can see how high and how wide something is. We can also see how far in front of or in back of something a thing is. The brain tells other parts of the body how to work. Some of the things the body does are _ ; that is, we don't have to think about them. For example, we don't have to think to make our heart beat or our stomach work. The brain tells the eyes and hands how to make useful and beautiful things. That is how human beings become tool makers and artists. That is how human can have richer and better lives than other animals.	['artists']
Americans couldn't eat popcorn in cinemas before 1930s because _ .	"Do you go to the movies during the holidays? What do you eat there? Popcorn ? Yes, of course! More and more Chinese youth now like to eat popcorn when they watch movies at the theater. However, it may be the Americans who love popcorn the most. Americans do fun things with their popcorn. They like to put butter on their popcorn. But that's not all; they also like other kinds of things like chocolate, and even cheese! Americans like to eat popcorn as a snack . These days, there are a lot of ""low -fat"" kinds of popcorn in US shops to keep people healthy. Americans started eating popcorn in movie theaters in the 1930s. Before this, they couldn't because movies were silent and popcorn made too much noise. When movies got noisier, people could eat noisier food.

We can infer from the passage that the writer of the passage is _ .	"Good evening parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends. I would like to thank you all for coming on this very special day for every student on this stage. I know how proud you must be. As we have grown over the years, there are many steps and stages we all have gone through. From learning our shapes and color1s, to getting our first kiss in middle school, or how about explaining to our parents why we skipped school because the headmaster called home. As we remember these days, things that we've done will be with us forever. But this is only the start of our journey. To graduate is one more step we've taken in our lives. Now I would like to take the time to thank everyone who has helped me get this far. First of all, thank you to all the teachers. None of us would be here without you always pushing our studying abilities to the fullest. My brother Jeramie who always said, ""If anyone is meant to you, I'll take care of it.""

What would be the best title for the passage?	"It was a late Wednesday night when the dreading phone call reached our home. I sat up, somehow terrified, so I could hear the phone call better. To my surprise, I heard my mom burst into tears. ""Get the car, Dean! Andrea has been in a car accident."" _ We got to the hospital, but were not allowed to see Andrea. The next morning, after wearing masks, we were allowed to go to the ICU to see Andrea. Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident. Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done. Though busy with dealing with pain and therapy, she always found time to love and play with me. I'll never forget the impact that this incident made on my life. I admire her strong-willed personality and her determined spirit. Today she is perfectly normal, despite the scars and the pins holding her leg in place. I couldn't ask for a better sister, hero, or best friend."	['My Sister -- the Hero in My Life']
The farmers in _ can not visit each other easily on weekdays.	All the cities are quite the same. Living in a modern Australian city is not very different from living in an American city. But there are some differences on farms. In many parts of the world, farmers and their families live in villages or towns. In the United States, each farm family lives in its own fields. Usually their neighbours live far away. It's hard for them to see each other on weekdays. Their children take school buses to the nearest schools. These schools are only for the farm families in this area. In some areas, there are small schools for a few farm families, and the children walk to schools. Life keeps changing for everyone, so do farmers. Today there are cars, good roads, radios, television sets and there are modern machines for farming. All of these are changing farm life.

What are the most precious things for every person according to the writer`s ideas ?	"In today's world many people seem to be hungry for money. Money does have its most useful effect on the poor. But once a person has a rich life, a lot more money doesn`t mean more happiness. If money were everything, all millionaires would have real love, true friendship, good health and a long life. However, this is not always true .But can love be bought ?I`m afraid not . Love means to give , not to take . To every person , health and long life are probably the most precious things . Well , can health and a long life be bought with money ? The answer is ""No"". Of all the longest living people in the world, few of them are millionaires. True friendship can't be bought, either. In a word, where money is dreamed too much, it can cause brothers to quarrel, marriage to end, lovers to hate, and strangers to fight. No matter how much money you have, it is still not enough to make a happy person if you have no one to laugh with, no one to cry for. ,."	['Health and a long life']
why did't Tanis go to college after high school?	Dear Alfred, I want to tell you how important your help is to my life. Growing up, I had people telling me I was too slow, though, with an IQ of 150 at 17, I'm anything but stupid. The fact was that I was found to have ADIID . Anxious all the time, I was unable to keep focused for more than an hour at a time. However, when something did interest me, I could become absorbed. In high school, I became curious about the computer, and built my first website. Moreover, I completed the senior course of Computer Basics, plus five relevant pre-college courses. While I was exploring my curiosity, my disease got worse. I wanted to go to college after high school, but couldn't . So, I was killing my time at home until June 2012 when I discovered the online computer courses of your training center. Since then, I have taken courses like Data Science and Advanced Mathematics. Currently, I'm learning your Probability course. I have hundreds of printer paper, covered in self-written notes from your video. This has given me a purpose. Last year, I spent all my time looking for a job where, without dealing with the public , I could work alone, but still have a team to talk to. Luckily, I discovered the job--Data Analyst--this month and have been going full steam ahead. I want to prove that I can teach myself a respectful profession, without going to college, and be just as good as, if not better than, my competitors. Thank you. You've given me hope that I can follow my heart. For the first time, I feel good about myself because I'm doing something, not because someone told me I was doing good. I feel whole. This is why you're saving my life. Yours, Tanis	['She had more difficulty keeping foucesed']
In Tan's opinion, what is NOT the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou	"It was a long process that involved creating a resume, submitting an online application and attending a round of interviews. Naturally Tan Kaiyin, a 21-year-old student is excited when she was selected, as more than 660, 000 people signed up to volunteer at the 16thAsian Games in Guangzhou, but only less than 10 percent were finally chosen to work in the venues and wear the white and green sport uniforms. Like in any major sporting event, volunteers play a vital role in assisting with operations and Tan's function here is not any different. She is based at the Garden Hotel and is tasked with helping guests and officials who have issues with their accreditation cards . ""I deal with guests from all over the world, I have never met so many international people and it is very, very exciting to have this opportunity to interact with them. They come to the office because they need to make a change in their accreditation card and usually they are in a hurry, so we try our best to get it done quickly."" She admits the first few days involved extremely long hours, however she likes the challenge as it gives her an immense sense of satisfaction especially when an irate guest turns a frown into a smile and says ""thank you"". Tan deals with people from different cultures and personalities and feels she has learned so much in the past week, an experience that she would have never gotten if not for the Guangzhou Asian Games, therefore she is very happy and grateful for being a part of this. She also has kind words for her managers and fellow colleagues and says the hard work and positive atmosphere has bonded them into a family. She enjoys her responsibilities so much that she is afraid of feeling lost when the Games finally end on Nov. 27. However, she is aware of all the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou. From improvements to air and water quality to better transportation and infrastructure in the city, but most importantly to her is the fact that the Asian Games has placed Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. This, she believes, will encourage people from all over the world to continue visiting her city, and this in turn will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. The official Asian Games Volunteer Slogan is, ""Together, we can make it better!"" Indeed it seems they can."	"[""It disturbs people's normal life who are living in Guangzhou.""]"

The following advantages of hiring bikes are mentioned EXCEPT that _ .	The Gold Coast family holidays are always great fun whether you are from Australia or from abroad. There are beautiful beaches, adventure parks, nature parks and so much more. There are so many sights to see here. It is a pity to drive in a car and you'll miss a great part of it. Australia is home to many animals and birds that can only be seen when moving slowly and going into the areas that they live. When you are on a bicycle, you have the advantage of being able to stop whenever you want to see an interesting animal or bird that you have never seen before. It is a quieter mode of transportation as well, so you might even be able to take a picture. When you are on the beach, you can breathe that clean air and view the beauty of the water and sand. It is a totally different experience from either simply sunbathing or passing it in a car. There are many choices of hiring a bicycle to experience the Gold Coast attractions. There are stores that will fit a bike perfectly to your size. These bikes for both adults and children are in many styles and colors to please any taste. If you have ever wanted to try a tandem bike , now is your chance, because they have those too. A bicycle hire on Gold Coast is something that everyone should try at least once. This is a wonderful chance for anyone who likes to cycle and it is also a cheap way to travel with your family.	['it is a good way to do sunbathing']

""I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,"" she announced. The audience was quiet; no one raised a hand. I nudged my sister and whispered to her that this was Dad ,for my third child and my father had a deep bond(,) and he called her Jilly. Although I sensed his presence, I wasn't confident enough to raise my hand. I needed something a bit more concrete, something undoubted. ""This man is letting me know he had cancer,"" she continued. I nudged my sister harder and assured her this was our father. Lisa went on to say that this person died in June (my father had died June 8th). There was swelling of the legs. ""Important information,"" she called out. My heart beat fast . I jumped up when she asked, ""Who is holding his watch?"" I waved the watch in the air. ""He wishes you congratulations."" My fourth child was born three weeks after my father died. I was in shock and could not believe I was getting a chance to hear from him, yet I knew our bond was strong enough that he could come to the world. She banged on her chest like an ape and apologized, saying, ""I don't know why but he wants me to do this like Tarzan."" It didn't resonate with me until my sister called out ""King Kong!"" I was convinced. No way could this woman have ever known a detail unless Dad was communicating through her. Each bit of information she gave us was just as meaningful. She ended our session by informing us that he would send us coins. The very next day I found six coins in various places; they seemed to have come out of nowhere. Even in death he is my Kong, and he remains important in my life."	['Miraculous Messages from Heaven']
When the writer was small, he lived _ .	"As a youngster, there was nothing I liked better than Sunday afternoons at my grandfather's farm in western Pennsylvania. Surrounded by miles of winding stone walls, the house and field provided endless hours of fun for a city kid like me. I was used to tidy living rooms that seemed to whisper, ""Not to be touched!"" I can still remember one afternoon when I was eight years old. Since my first visit to the farm, I had wanted more than anything to be allowed to climb the stone walls surrounding the houses. My parents would never _ . The walls were old; some stones were missing, others loose and falling. Still, my idea to climb across those walls grew so strong that finally, one spring afternoon, I had all my courage to enter the living room, where the adults had gathered after Sunday dinner. ""I, uh-I want to climb the stone walls,"" I said. Everyone looked up. ""Can I climb the stone walls? ""Immediately voices of disagreement went up from the women in the room. ""Heavens, no!"" You'll hurt yourself!"" I wasn't too disappointed; the response was just as I'd expected. But before I could leave the room, I was stopped by my grandfather's loud voice. ""Now hold on just a minute,"" I heard him say. ""Let the boy climb the stone walls. He has to learn to do things for himself."" ""Go,"" he said to me, ""and come and see me when you get back."" For the next two and a half hours I climbed those old walls -and had the time of my life. Later I met with my grandfather to tell him about my adventures. I'll never forget what he said. ""Fred,"" he said, smiling, ""You made this day a special day just by being yourself. Always remember, there's only one person in this whole world like you, and I like you exactly as you are."" Many years have passed since then, and today I host the television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, seen by millions of children throughout America. There have been changes over the years, but one thing remains the same: my message to children at the end of almost every visit. ""There's only one person in this whole world like you,"" the kids can count on hearing me say, ""and people can like you exactly as you are."""	['in the city']
Not considering the exact number of the single-parent families, which country saw the fastest rise rate in 1999, compared with 1990?	"Across the globe, single parent homes are on the rise. In the US, the 2000 census showed 24.8 million, or nearly 24 percent of the nation's 105.5 million households, were traditional two-parent homes. By comparison, 9.8 million households, or 9 percent of all US households were headed by an adult raising a child alone. The 1990 census showed 26 percent of homes were led by a married mother and father, and 8 percent of homes were led by a single parent. Similar increases occurred in other countries. In the UK, lone-parent homes increased from 3.3 percent in 1990 to 5.5 percent in 1999. Single parent households in Australia rose from 5.8 percent in 1990 to 7.6 percent in 1999. Belgium saw the increase from 1.8 percent to 2.7 percent during the same period of time. These countries tend to have greater acceptance of the single parent because there are fewer nearby family members to disapprove, Riche, a Census Bureau director, said. Just as in the US, those changes raised new questions about how involved govenment should be in helping single parent families. Some research suggests children raised in two-parent families are better off than those who depend on one. ""The position of one-parent families in any country is very much a gender issue-women's opportunities, especially working-class women on low income,"" said Sue Cohen, coordinator of the Single Action Parents Network in England."

When the woman passed a box through the window, the author felt _ .	"I am usually in a bad mood after a long day at work, but on this particular Friday afternoon I was in a cheerful mood.I planned to have a good meal and watch Bridget Jones's Diary. My local supermarket is always busy.The first parking space I spotted was convenient, but I'd noticed a woman in an old car circling for a while.I let her have it.On the edge of the car park I backed into the next available spot--it was a tight fit. In record time I'd made my way through the supermarket and was back in the fresh air.In such a rush of good spirits, I emptied my purse change into the hands of a homeless man and helped a struggling woman go backwards into a parking space. Just as I spotted my car, 1 saw the woman I'd let have my car space earlier.I smiled and wished her a pleasant day. As I got back into my car, I spotted the same lady looking ill at me.""Hello,"" she said, hesitantly.""This might sound crazy but I was on my way to drop some of my mother's things off at tile charity bins."" I looked quickly at the orange bins in the corner of the parking lot, confused.""I saw you helping those people, and you seemed so happy.My mom had a dress just like that."" She looked at me meaningfully.I smiled at her in encouragement, hoping she wouldn't notice that the dress she was admiring was now full of holes.""I was going to give these away, but you are just so much like her."" She passed a box in through the window.Shocked, unthinking, 1 took it automatically.""I think she would like you to have it."" She smiled and walked away. After a pause, I opened the box.Inside was a beautiful gold necklace.It was the nicest gift I'd ever received, and it was from a complete stranger. Later, I thought back on the day.I didn't feel the usual sense of exhaustion.The necklace was around my neck, a warm reminder of human kindness."	['surprised']
According to Richard, what is the best way to achieve well-being?	"Finding true happiness is a universal aspiration . We all want it, but can we all have it? Genuine happiness is written all over our faces when we are truly contented, and, likewise, a forced smile does nothing to hide underlying sadness. Believing that everyone can create their own lasting joy, Matthieu Richard has been declared the Happiest Man in the World. Richard earned his ""happiest man"" status after a series of laboratory tests in 2004. Richard has shared his thoughts on happiness with a worldwide audience. As an experienced speaker, he has explained his insights into happiness to everyone, from students to corporate groups. Looking inwards to find joy rather than relying on outer conditions, he believes, is the way to achieve well-being. ""It's quite clear that the outer conditions are not enough. The way we interpret those outer conditions in our inner experience is what determines either a sense of well-being or misery. We love to go jogging for fitness and we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful, yet we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most: the way our minds function. It's the essential thing that determines the quality of our experience."" Besides this, Richard stresses that it is not what's happening around us that makes us unhappy, but rather the way we choose to react to it. The pursuit of happiness is becoming a modern obsession . As life becomes more complex, our ability to process our reactions to various outside influences comes under strain. ""Genuine happiness"" he says, ""doesn't mean pleasant feelings one after the other. It's more like a series of qualities that we can develop as skills -- like openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength and inner peace."""

"According to the passage, the ""Method"" _ ."	"Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all time. He was born in Omaha Nebraska in 1924. He was named after his father, a salesman. His mother, Dorothy, was an actress in the local theater. Marlon Brando moved to New York City when he was 19 years old in 1943. He took acting classes at the New School for Social Research. One of his teachers was Stella Adler, who taught the ""Method"" style of realistic acting. The Method teaches actors how to use their own memories and emotions to identify with the characters they are playing. Marlon Brando learned the Method style quickly and easily. Critics said he was probably the greatest Method actor ever. One famous actress commented on his natural ability for it. She said teaching Marlon Brando the Method was like sending a tiger to jungle school. Marlon Brando appeared in several plays. He got his first major part in a Broadway play in 1947, at the age of 23. He received great praise for his powerful performance at Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams' play, A Streetcar Named Desire. His fame grew when he acted the same part in the movie version, released in 1951. Marlon Brando won the Best Actor Oscar for The God Father, but he rejected it. He sent a woman named Sasheen Littlefeather to speak for him at the Academy Awards ceremony. She said that Brando could not accept the award because of the way the American film industry treated Native Americans. The people at the Academy Awards ceremony did not like the speech. But some experts think the action helped change the way American Indians were shown in movies. Marlon Brando acted in about forty movies. He was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards. But he earned a ""bad boy"" reputation for his public outbursts and unusual behaviours. According to Los Angeles magazine, ""Brando was rock and roll before anybody knew what rock and roll was"". His later life was marked with family tragedies. His son Christian went to prison for killing his daughter Cheyene's boyfriend. Cheyene later committed suicide. Brando became lonely. He worked occasionally for the money. But, in his prime, Marlon Brando was an actor other actors could only hope to become."	"[""wasn't very difficult for Marlon Brando""]"
What is the main point of the passage?	"The Smurfs --cute little blue cartoon dwarfs inspired by Nordic fairy tales made their first TV appearance in the US in 1981 and ever since have been childhood friends to many people across. The storyline is quite simple. The Smurfs are living happily in their mushroom houses in the middle of a forest.Then one day the evil wizard Gargamel discovers their village and sends them by magic to present-day New York City. The Smurfs have to find their way home and conquer Gargamel along the way. So, just why, more than half a century later, is the simple story still so beloved by young and old? Mario Cacciolotto, a BBC reporter, believes it is due to the fact that the Smurfs' lives do not have any particular cultural implication and argues that they could offer a model for society. Veronique Culliford, daughter of the Smurfs' creator Pierre Culliford, agrees.""They are unique creations,"" she says, ""They do not do politics or religion.They are multi-cultural and everybody around the world can recognize themselves in the Smurfs.Everyone can apply their very nice values of friendship, kindness and helping others to their own lives, regardless of where they come from"". In the Smurf world , everyone has their own skill and is willing to use it for the benefit of others without expecting any reward.Their village is run as a collective and has no form of currency. This has even led to debates about whether the artist intended the Smurfs as a metaphor for socialism. ""The series wasn't just about sweet-looking dwarfs,"" said Alan Mechem of the British Smurf Collectors Club.He thought that Culliford wanted it to show things like equality and tolerance."

People tried to find their relations by calling out their names and_.	Perfect Disaster All around us buildings shook. We decided to leave the town. We stopped once we had left the buildings behind us. The carts were moving in opposite directions, though the ground was perfectly flat, and they wouldn't stay in place even with their wheels blocked by stones. In addition, it seemed as though the sea was being sucked backwards, as if it were being pushed back by the shaking of the land. Certainly the shoreline moved outwards, and many sea animals were left on dry sand. Behind us were frightening dark clouds that opened up to show fire--like lightning, but bigger. Not long after that the clouds reached down to the ground and covered the sea. Now came the dust, though still thin. I looked back. A dense cloud appeared behind us, following us like a flood pouring across the land. Then a darkness came that was not like a moonless or cloudy night, but more like being in a closed and unlighted room. You could hear women and children crying, men shouting. Some were calling for parents, others for children; they could only recognize them by their voices. Darkness and ashes came again, a great weight of them. We stood up and shook the ash off again and again; otherwise we would have been covered with it and crushed by the weight. At last the cloud became thinner and thinner until it was no more than smoke or fog. Soon there was real daylight. The sight that met our still terrified eyes was a changed world, buried in ash like snow. --from Pliny's letter to a friend	['listening to their voices']

The author grabbed the cheese bun the moment before he got off because _ .	"Any passenger on the subway who caught a glimpse of me may have already thought that I was strange. In particular this gentleman sitting opposite me was staring at me, at the cheese bun on the floor in front of me, and then back at me; ""Next stop, St. Patrick Station"" my stop was quickly coming up. I had minutes to either take the cheese bun, which nobody else was claiming(as a passenger probably dropped it by mistake and got off at a previous stop), or leave it there and hope that it didn't go to waste. In those few minutes I felt my pride getting in the way. ""What would other people on this subway think of me if I took the Cheese bun? Would they think that I was poor and hungry? Would they think that I'm stealing?"" The ignorant thing to do was say ""yes"" to any of those self-imposed questions, which would only justify my ego. But then I'd get off the subway, walk a block up the street to my office, get settled at my desk, and despite feeling comfortable, warm, and being well-fed myself for the whole day, there would be a weight of guilt and regret weighing on my consciousness. My thoughts were pushing me towards pride and ignorance when the truth was evident:this missing cheese bun is a gift. For a homeless person who is hungry and cold. For me to overcome a little bit of ego and pass along so much kindness. It was clear that the homeless person who would receive this cheese bun needed it just as much as I did. ks5u Just as the doors opened at my stop I grabbed the cheese bun and exited the subway. It felt awesome and I didn't care if people were looking or what they thought.

I always wanted to give him something. There he was this morning, wrapped in a sleeping bag."	['he valued kindness more than his own pride after a careful thought']
Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?	Whether you are hanging out with your friends in between classes or going to the movies with them during the weekend, you will find that having friends is a really great thing. Friends are _ who will have a great time with you all the time. Even if you can't get together with your friends you can usually get a hold of them by phone, email or text messaging. Conversation is another value which people consider with regard to friendship. Everyone needs to talk and share their thoughts and feelings and friends are great in providing this for you. Friends also lend a helping hand when it is needed. Every once in a while you will find that you have a problem which your friends can often help you out with. Whether it deals with a fight with your parents or other problems, your friends are there for you. This is an important trait when it comes to friendship. Those who have good friends will also find that laughter is a big part of the relationship. No one can make you laugh like your friends and laughter is so good for keeping your spirits up and making your day bright. You will find that the more good friends you have, the more laughter and happiness you will have in your life. Just keep in mind, though, that it is often quality of friends and not quantity of friends which make a person happy.	['The True Value of Friendship']

According to the passage, which of the following statements is NOT true?	"As people in China celebrated Singles' Day on November 11, the media eagerly discussed why so many marriageable young people fail to find their other half. While single people in China are pitied, their counterparts in some Western countries feel they are being discriminated against. In the US, where more than a quarter of all households consists of one person, single people often pay more insurance than married people. They don't get the same tax breaks and they seldom get promoted at work. There seems to be a bad name attached to their status - somehow their personality is flawed and therefore they are not to be trusted. Activities have created the term ""singlism"" to describe discrimination against unmarried people. It means stereotyping , stigmatizing and discrimination against those who are single. Globally, the number of people living alone is skyrocketing. Many people are at peace with being single and some even choose to remain single. But why are so many of us worried about singledom? Michael Cobb, professor of English at the University of Toronto in Canada, says that pop culture is to blame for people's fear of singledom. His book Single: Arguments for the Uncoupled is a critical examination of singleness in favor of the couple, making singletons one of the most despised sexual minorities in Western countries. In pop culture, singles are viewed as immature, whereas fully adults are able to form relationships and live meaningful lives. The overall message is clear: go ahead and be yourself, but if you want real happiness, make sure you get coupled up. You may get that idea from US comedy series Sex and the City and the most recent Girls, or UK's Bridge Jones' Diary."	['Half of the people in the US remain single.']

Which of the following may be a reason why Yemen is short of water?	"In Yemen, you always see one type of vehicle on the road: the water truck.They travel mountain roads and cross deserts to bring Yemenis the goods more valuable than oil.It is one that only the rich can afford, with the supply regularly being cut off.Others must rely on scarce rain or charity to fight thirst. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.""In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, "" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. ""There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,"" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food."

Which of the following will damage the tourists' fun at Mediterranean resorts and beaches?	People travel for a lot of reasons.Some travelers go to see battlefields or religious shrines.Others are looking for culture,or simply want to have their photos taken in front of famous places.But most Europeans are willing to pay a lot of money and put up with a lot of inconveniences for the sun because they have so little of it.Residents of cities like London,Copenhagen,and Amsterdam spend a lot of their winter in the dark because the days are so short and much of the rest of the year is in the rain.Every summer,more than 25 million people travel to Mediterranean resorts and beaches for their vacation.They all come for the same reason: sun. The huge crowds mean lots of money for the economies of Mediterranean countries.Italy's 30,000 hotels are booked every summer.And 13 million people camp out on French Beaches,parks,and roadsides.Spain's long sandy coastline attracts more people than anywhere else.37 million tourists visit yearly,or one tourist for every person living in Spain. But there are signs that the area is getting more tourism than it can handle.The Mediterranean is already one of the most polluted seas on earth.And with increased tourism,it's getting worse.The French can't figure out what to do with all the garbage left by campers around St.Tropez.And in many places,swimming is dangerous because of pollution. None of this,however,is damaging anyone's fun.The Mediterranean gets more popular every year with tourists.Obviously,they don't go there for clean water.They stand traffic jams and seem to like crowded beaches.They don't even mind the pollution.No matter how dirty the water is,the coastline still looks beautiful.And as long as the sun shines,it's still better than sitting in the cold rain in Berlin,London,or else.

Why did the boy want to sell things ?	"One day, a poor boy was trying to sell things from door to door to pay for school. He was hungry. Then he decided to ask for a meal at the next house.

We can infer from the passage that _ .	"One of my China Dialogue colleagues in Beijing recently bought a Philips energy-saving light bulb to replace a standard one.He was happy with his choice.It may have cost 30 yuan (just under US$4.50) - ten times the price of a filament bulb - but he wanted to save energy as part of his low-carbon lifestyle.And according to the shopkeeper, he would save, in the long run, much more than the 30 yuan he was spending. Yet only one month later, his expensive light bulb blew up, before he had saved even a small part of the purchase price.Will he stick to his high-cost, low-carbon lifestyle? China's environmental organizations have started to advocate low-carbon lifestyles and the decrease of carbon footprints to help fight against climate change.But they have overlooked one fact: in China, low-carbon living comes at a high cost.It means buying energy-saving bulbs and appliances, and environmentally friendly building materials and daily goods.Cost can no longer be the only standard for purchases.An energy-saving and environmentally friendly product is more expensive than a standard alternative - whether it's a simple light bulb or the house it shines.For average consumers, even buying an ordinary bulb is a huge burden.How can we persuade ordinary people to choose an energy-saving residence? This is not a trend they can afford to follow; perhaps this fashion is only for the rich. Most consumers today do not cause huge carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.Their responsibility lies not in choosing a low-carbon lifestyle today, but in avoiding a high-carbon life in the future.The principle of ""common but differentiated responsibility"" - a basis of sustainable development - can be applied here as well. In China, low-carbon living still is resisted by a lack of social infrastructure . Even if your salary allows you to make that choice, nobody is there to help you accomplish it. Consider energy-saving homes. You need to find out whether or not the developer has used natural materials wherever possible; how effective the insulation(, ) is; and what the green credentials of installed equipment are.You can read up a little, but you'll still be lucky to avoid being puzzled by the developers' marketing.Many so-called energy-saving buildings are nothing of the sort, and some are even more energy-hungry than the average home - as Li Taige warned in his article ""Energy-efficient buildings? Not always"", on China Dialogue last August."	"[""All citizens in China don't have the same responsibility in living a low-carbon lifestyle.""]"
Why did the author think his mother's death was unnecessary?	People often ask me how, as a man, I became so devoted to improving the quality of women's lives. It wasn't until age forty that I realized what had started me down my career path. One morning more than thirty-seven years ago, I was awakened by the passing school bus. I was thirteen years old, living at home with my two younger brothers and our mother, Doris Joy Heavin. She had just passed her fortieth birthday. She was a mother of five children and had suffered emotional and physical problems most of her life. Her doctor had tried various treatments on her with little benefit. As I awoke to the sound of the passing school bus, my brother Paul came in and told me that I'd better come quickly because mother was sick. As I knelt beside her bed, I could feel the absence of warmth. I put my arms around her, first to feel for a sign of life, and then as a final hug. I took my younger brothers, aged eight and nine, in my arms and gently told them that our mother was in heaven. Her death was unnecessary. The high blood pressure causing the blood clot that took her life was unnecessary. Rather than _ , she could have dealt with the cause of her high blood pressure: we now know that exercise and proper nutrition will almost always reduce the causes of high blood pressure and most other chronic diseases. Many years later, while teaching a fitness and weight loss class to a group of about eighty women, I realized I was subconsciously searching the crowd for the face of my mother.

When Mr. Smith learned that the woman didn't know who he was, he felt _ .	"Mr. Smith is well known in Washington because of his many social blunders. He always likes to attend the various social functions because he wants to expand his circle of friends. Whenever he is invited, he goes, unless he is ill. Recently he received an invitation to a fashionable banquet. Although he did not know the hostess, he accepted the invitation. He was secretly very pleased, because he felt that his reputation as a desirable guest was growing. When he arrived at the banquet hall, he found that about one hundred people had been invited. He began to move a-round the hall. He spoke to other guests whether he knew them or not. He soon realized that he had never met any of the other people present, although they seemed to know each other. At dinner he was seated beside a very dignified woman. The woman tried to be friendly even though she had never met Mr. Smith before. She spoke politely whenever he spoke to her. Between the first and the second course of the meal, she, turned to Mr. Smith and said, ""Do you see that gray-haired man at the end of the table? The one with glasses."" ""Ah, yes. Who is he?"" ""He's the Secretary of the Interior!"" she replied. Mr. Smith said, ""So that's the secretary of the Interior! I' m afraid that I find very little to admire about him, although he is the Secretary."" The woman stiffened and did not reply. Mr. Smith continued in spite of her coldness. ""I really can't see how he received his appointment unless he is perhaps a relative of the President."" ""It hardly matters whether you like the Secretary or not,"" she said. ""He was chosen because the President thought he was the man for the job. If he does the job well, you should have no complaint."" ""That's just it,"" persisted Mr. Smith. ""No one does the things he does, unless he is a complete fool!"" ""Sir!"" said the woman in all her dignity. ""Do you know who I am?"" ""No,"" replied Mr. Smith. ""I am the Secretary's wife,"" she said coldly. Mr. Smith was shocked, but he went on in spite of his embarrassment. ""Madam, do you know who I am?"" ""No, I don't,"" the woman replied. ""Thank goodness!"" exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he quickly left the table."	['relieved']
Which fact can NOT explain why soap is important?	October 15th is Global Handwashing Day.Activities are planned in more than twenty countries to get millions of people in the developing world to wash their hands with soap. Experts say people around the world wash their hands but very few use soap at so-called critical moments.These include after using the toilet, after cleaning a baby and before touching food. Global Handwashing Day is the idea of the Public-private Partnership for handwashing with soap.The goal, they say, is to create a culture of handwashing with soap.The organizers say all soaps are equally effective at removing disease-causing germs.They say the correct way to wash is to wet your hands with a small amount of water and cover them with soap.Rub it into all areas, including under the fingernails.Then, wash well under running water.Finally, dry your hands with a clean cloth. The Partnership says soap is important because it increases the time that people spend washing.Soap also helps to break up the dirt that holds most of the germs.And it usually leaves a pleasant smell, which increases the chances that people will wash again. It also says that washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet could save more lives than any medicine.It could help reduce cases of diarrhea, which is the second leading cause of child deaths, killing more than one and a half million children a year, by almost half.	['It gets all people into the habit of washing hands.']
In the soap opera, the little girl isn't allowed to _ .	"A soap opera called ""Tiger Mother and Cat Father"" is popular in China now. The tiger mother is pretty strict with her daughter and the little girl is not allowed to watch TV or play computer games. On the other hand, she makes all efforts to buy the expensive house near the key school, in order to let her daughter have a better education. However, the cat father has an opposite _ of how to raise their child. He gives her daughter more independence and doesn't make many rules for her. Which one is better, "" Tiger Mother""or ""Cat Father""? In China, it seems that in each family, there is tiger mother and a cat father, even worse, some families have two tigers. Children can't decide anything for themselves. What's worse, Chinese mothers believe key school will bring a better future to their children. This soap opera fully shows us a common problem in China. And maybe it is the real reason why such kind of TV shows can get popular. Whether the tiger mother or the cat father, respecting children and growing together are the keys to family education. Confidence, kindness, honesty and independence are the most important qualities to develop a child, not the grades. Just like a poem said, ""Educating children is like walking with a snail , and the steps are gentle and slow."""	['watch TV or play computer games']
In what aspects do The United States and Japan show worry for AIIB?	More than 40 countries, including Russia and Taiwan, have agreed to be founding members of China's proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. However, two of the world's largest economies, the United States and Japan, have _ at this time. China proposed the bank last October as a way to finance roads, bridges, ports and other needed infrastructureprojects in Asia. The time limit for joining as a founding member was March 31. In only a few months, the number of countries seeking membership nearly doubled. They came from Africa, Europe, South America, Asia and the Pacific. Some European powers added themselves to the list. They include Britain, Germany, France and Italy. Other important economies include South Korea, Australia and Russia. Taiwan also sought to become a founding member. But it is not clear how China will react. Taiwan and China do not have diplomatic ties. But, relations have improved since the election of President Ma Ying-jeou in 2008. The two sides also are working on details of a trade agreement. However, popular opposition in Taiwan to mainland China's increased influenceon the island remains very strong. The U.S. and Japan have said they are concerned about the governance of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or AIIB. The United States has urged countries to consider details about the bank's governance and standards -- itssocialand environmental policy -- before joining. Critics say the AIIB threatens the work of existing development banks such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank. Yet, the Asian Development Bank itself noted in a recent report that the need for infrastructure projects in Asia is great. The institution, led by the U.S. and Japan, estimated last May that the Asia Pacific area needed $800 billion each year in infrastructure development. Experts are watching to see how China will take its leadership role in the new bank. The AIIB is expected to start with $100 billion in capital, mostly from China. Some experts point to the high interest in membership. Shi Yinhong is a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing. He says China's leading part in the bank comes withbenefitsand costs. In other words, while China has gained from the effort to develop the AIIB, it will also have to satisfy other bank members and multi-national institutions. Officials at the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank say they are looking for ways to cooperate with the AIIB.	['Regulation and running']
How did McKenna probably feel when she found out what kind of oven Hasbro produces? ks5u	"When McKenna Pope, 13, went shopping for a Christmas gift for her little brother, she planned to buy him an Easy-Bake Oven, a toy that allows kids to bake treats. Her brother, Gavyn Boscio, 4, loves to cook. But McKenna changed her mind when she discovered that Hasbro, the toy company that produces the popular oven, only makes the toy in purple and pink--and only features girls on the box and in commercials. So instead of buying an oven, McKenna cooked up another plan. She started a campaign to get Hasbro to make a gender-neutral oven. ""I don't want them to make a boys' Easy-Bake Oven and a girls' Easy-Bake Oven,"" McKenna, from Garfield, New Jersey, told the Associated Press. ""I want them to make an Easy-Bake Oven for kids."" The Easy-only Bake Oven was first introduced in 1963. At the time, the stereotype was that only women cooked. Today, that's changed, in part thanks to famous male chefs like, Bobby Flay, who used an Easy-Bake Oven when he was a kid. Over the years, Hasbro says the company has featured boys on the packaging and offered the product in several different color1 schemes. But this year, just the purple and pink model is available. McKenna wants that to change, and she's not alone. Her petition , posted on change.org, has received more than 45,000 signatures. By next summer, McKenna should have her wish. On December 17, Hasbro invited the New Jersey teen and her family to their headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to meet with the Easy-Bake Oven team. They showed her a prototype, or model, of their newest Easy-Bake Oven, which is scheduled to hit stores in 2013. The new color1 scheme is black, silver and blue. The company also told McKenna they plan to feature boys in ads. McKenna was happy with what she saw at Hasbro. ""They really met most or even all of what I wanted them to, and they really amazed me,"" McKenna said. She added that Gavyn thought the new design was ""awesome""."	['Disappointed.']
We can see from the text that _ .	"Warner Brothers is an American company that produces movies and television shows. It started as a small family business operated by four brothers -- Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner. In nineteen-oh-three, the brothers began their business by traveling throughout Ohio and Pennsylvania showing movies using a projector . By nineteen-oh-seven, they opened a movie theater in New Castle, Pennsylvania. Within ten years, the Warner brothers started producing movies, and moved that part of the business to California. In nineteen eighteen, their first complete picture was called ""My Four Years in Germany."" The film was based on a book by the United States' ambassador to the court of Kaiser Wilhelm. In nineteen twenty-five, they began to work to include the technology for sound in their movies. Two years later, Warner Brothers Pictures released the first major movie with sound, or ""talking picture."" It was called ""The Jazz Singer"" and it was a huge success. In the nineteen thirties, the company made several films that were highly praised, including ""Little Caesar,"" ""The Public Enemy"", ""The Gold Diggers"" and ""Forty-Second Street."" The Warner Brothers' success continued in the nineteen forties with movies like ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and ""Casablanca."" Movies during this time starred popular actors like Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Gary Cooper and Bette Davis. The company continues to produce popular movies today. By the nineteen seventies, the Warner Brothers studios had also become well set up in television. In nineteen ninety, Warner Communications combined with Time Incorporated to form Time Warner Incorporated. In two thousand one, the company combined with America Online. The company now includes film production, cable television networks, music and publishing. This year, the company announced a deal with the CBS Corporation to form a new television broadcast network. The CW began broadcasting this month."	['The Warner Brothers has expanded  its business greatly since it was set up.']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	French novelist Jules Verne (1828--1905) is often called the father of science fiction. Although he was not a great traveler himself, his characters travelled to the moon (inFrom the Earth to the Moon), under the sea (inTwenty thousand leagues under the sea), into a volcano (inA journey to the centre of the earth), around the world (inAround the World in Eighty Days) and to many other places. Jules Verne was born in the French city of Nantes in 1828. When he was a boy he ran away from home to work on a ship. However, his father soon found him and brought him home. After that he decided that any future travel he did would be in books. In 1847 his father sent Jules to Paris to study to be a lawyer. Even though he was busy writing, Verne passed his exams in 1849 with high marks. When Jules told his father he did not want to be a lawyer, his father was very angry. He stopped sending his son any money, so Jules had to earn a living by his writing. Over the next few years he wrote many stories and plays, which brought him only a little money. Then, in 1856, he met Honorine de Viane, a rich, young widow with two children. The couple married the next year. After his marriage, Verne worked as a businessman in Paris. However, he was not very successful at his job and spent most of his time writing books and doing research for the next one. In 1863 he published his novelFive Weeks in a balloonand the following year he publishedA Journey to the centre of the earthwhich made him famous. His books became so popular and earned him so much money that he was able to leave his job and work full time on his writing. In his Lifetime, Jules Verne wrote more than 50 books and he became a rich man. Many of this imaginative novels have been turned into films.

_ was responsible for dumping oil into the Persian Gulf.	Every year 2.2 million tons of oil are spilled ( , ) into the ocean. Actually, this only amounts to a small percentage of the total 1.6 billion tons of oil shipped around the world each year.However, this spilled oil has terrible effects on ocean life, including the coastlines where the off washes up onto shore. Some of the largest spills in history were caused by oil tankers running into each other or by an oil tanker sailing into shallow water and hitting the bottom of the ocean. After these spills, officials try to discover who or what was at fault to help prevent similar accidents in the future. One of the worst oil spills in history occurred along the Alaskan coastline in 1989. In this accident, 42,000 tons of oil spilled from a tanker which resulted in terrible damage to this sensitive natural area. In this spill, the tanker's captain, who was tired from overwork and drinking alcohol, had gone to take a rest. He gave control of the ship to the third mate. The third mate was unfamiliar with the path the ship took, and he ran the ship onto Blighe Reef. Blighe Reef is a natural underwater rock wall near the Alaskan coast. Damaged by the reef, the ship leaked oil out into the ocean. More than 1,600 kilometers of coastline were affected by the oil spill. Some scientists who studied nature in the area guessed that 580,000 birds and 5,500 otters died when the oil from the spill covered their skin. As well, smaller shellfish and other sea creatures were later eaten by seals, whales, and other animals. The most oil ever spilled was actually dumped on purpose as an act of ecological warfare. The term ecological warfare means to fight by doing harm to nature in the area under attack. In 1990, Iraq sent soldiers into Kuwait and set off the Persian Gulf War. As part of the Iraq war plan,900,000 tons of oil were let out into the Persian Gulf Way Iraq. This oil covered 1,500 square kilometers of water in the Persian Gulf. The oil also damaged 650 kilometers of the coastline of both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In some places, oil floating on the water was measured to be 43 centimeters thick. Water birds, water plants, and baby fish were all seriously affected by the oil. The long-term effects of this act on the food chain in the area are bound to cause problems tar into the future.

Who can learn to read fast and with comprehension?	For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation. To keep up with their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, interoffice communications: a never-ending flood of words. In getting a job or advancing in one, the ability to read and comprehend quickly can mean the difference between success and failure. Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us are poor readers. Most reading faults can be traced to early school training. According to Dr. Betts, two persons out of five in school were forced to read material too difficult for them to understand at the time, a frustration experience which left them with bad reading habits. Fortunately, almost anyone can learn to read faster and with more comprehension. Age makes little difference. According to a recent study of 138 students at The Reading Laboratory, Inc. , all age groups showed a marked increase in reading rate after training from 93 percent for the 50-90 age group to 142 percent for the 20-29.Dr. Mila Banton Smith, director of New York University's Reading Institute, says that the average adult student, in 28 training hours, nearly triples his reading speed and boosts his comprehension by about 30 percent. The best way to improve your reading, of course, is to enroll in a reading clinic. If there's no clinic handy, you can improve your reading ability yourself--- provided you have no eyes troubles. (if reading tires you easily or makes your eyes or head ache, you should consult a doctor.)	['almost everybody']
It can be inferred from the passage that Plum is _ .	"I am a taxi driver. One Monday morning, I had stopped at New York Hospital when I found _ man dashing down the steps. He was waving to me. I waited until he jumped into the cab. "" LaGuardia Airport, please,"" he said. As always, I wondered about my passenger. "" What do you do?"" "" I am in the neurology department at the hospital."" For some unknown reason, I decided to ask for his help. "" Could I ask a favor of you?"" He didn't answer. "" I have a son, 16. He's doing well in school. He wants a job this summer. Is there any possibility that you might get him a summer job?"" After a pause, he said, "" The medical students have a research project. Maybe he could fit in. Have him send me his school records."" He searched his pocket and handed me a card. That evening, I pulled the card from my pocket. "" Robbie,"" I announced proudly, "" this could be a summer job for you. Send him your school records."" He read it out loud, "" Fred Plum, New York Hospital."" "" Is this a joke?"" he said in disbelief. After I shouted and threatened to cut off his pocket-money, Robbie promised to send off his grades the next morning. Two weeks later, when I arrived home, my son handed me a letter from Plum. He was to phone Plum's secretary for an interview. Robbie got the job. The white coat he wore made him feel more important than he really was. As high school graduation neared, Plum was kind enough to write letters of recommendation for universities. To our delight, Robbie was admitted to New York Medical College. It never occurred to me that a stranger should change my son's future."	['kind and helpful']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt. Scientists are still studying all the ways icebergs affect sea life.	['Icebergs are dangerous, but iceberg accidents can be predicted  .']
It can be learned from this passage that heart attack has nothing to do with _ .	"That ""Monday morning feeling"" could be a crushing pain in the chest which leaves you sweating and gasping for breath. Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2,600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 per cent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day. Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 per cent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day. A study of 11,000 Italians proved 8 am on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewer heart attacks in both countries. The findings could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. ""We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them,"" he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. ""When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies,"" Willich explained. ""All these things can have an unfavourable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries which will cause a heart attack."" ""When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes. They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger and more physical activity,"" said Willich."	['blood group']

Each report will also appear on the Internet at www. Tingroom.com. Currently you can find the programs from the last time our series aired. Foreign students who want to study in the United States have many questions. How do I find out about American colleges? How do I choose the right one for me? What tests must I take? What kinds of documents will I need? How much will it cost? We will answer these and other questions in our reports. We will discuss the American system of higher education. We will tell about financial aid and rules about working in jobs while a student. We will discuss required tests and explain English language requirements. And we will tell where to find help in other countries. Our reports will also describe a few of the three thousand colleges and universities in the United States. We will discuss programs of study as well as living situations at American schools. For students without the ability to come to the United States, we will tell how to take classes by computer. We will also examine how the threat of terrorism has changed some of the rules for study in the United States. In researching our series, we talked not only to officials in education and government, but also to some foreign students. Most students say planning ahead helped make their educational experience successful. That is the purpose of this series--to help you plan.

What led to the argument in Italian middle schools? _	"Have you ever seen any students whose trousers hang so low that you can see their underwear? What do you think of that? Fashionable? Some of today's teenagers are big fans of such a look. But recently this trend has been at the center of an argument in Italian middle schools. The headmaster of a school in central Italy has asked students to stop wearing low-rise jeans that expose underwear and parts of the body. His request came after a class trip, when he saw one boy's baggy trousers slide to his feet. He pointed out that this way of dressing is not suitable for school. But in Italy, a nation that takes fashion very seriously, the suggestion caused a debate among parents, teachers and students. The issue is whether the headmaster's request will limit students' freedom-- or whether dress in Italian schools is too casual. A parents' group praised the move in favor of good taste, while others advised schools to stop worrying about fashion and fix up old school buildings. ""We do not want to kick fashion out,"" the headmaster explained, ""but extremes of fashion like this are not right in school."" Many other schools have now requested that their students also stop wearing such trousers. Most students have simply ignored the request. Ludovica Gaudio, 14, wore extremely low trousers exposing orange underwear in class. It was cold, so she wore a matching orange scarf. Another 14-year-old said she would probably respect the request, simply for practical reasons. ""I don't really feel comfortable in those sort of jeans,"" said Sarah Lattanzi, ""in winter, when dressed like that, it's quite cold and I am afraid my stomach will ache."""

"A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January. El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season. ""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance. Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences. Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work. ""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote. On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance. Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees. El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school. ""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."""

Why were the student very confident at the beginning?	"It was the last day of final exams in a university. On the steps of one building, a group of engineering students were discussing the exam. On their faces was confidence . This was their last exam and then they would graduate. With all these four years of college behind them, they felt ready to go into the world. The professor had said they could bring any book or note they wanted, but they could not talk to each other. They went into the classroom happily. The professor gave them the papers. They smiled when they found that there were only five questions. Three hours passed and the professor began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked so confident . The professor faced the class. No one spoke. They just held papers in their hands. The professor then asked, ""How many of you finished all five questions?"" Not a hand was raised. ""How many answered four?"" Still no hand. ""Three? Two?"" The students looked worried in their seats. ""One, then?"" Certainly somebody finished one. However, nobody replied. The professor put down the papers. ""That is just what I thought,"" he said. ""I just want to tell you that, even though you have finished four years of engineering, there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are quite common in everyday practice."" Then he added with a smile, ""You will all pass this course, but remember----even though you are now college graduates, your education has just begun."""

What would be the best title for the passage?	"The food on the moon has come a long way from the freeze - dried bread to half - dried food. They have changed a lot in the past few years. And now US scientists want to grow vegetables in mini - greenhouses on the moon. Scientists say they are looking forward to a time when people on the moon or even Mars will be able to eat green and fresh vegetables. Paragon Space Development Corporation has shown people what it called the first step toward growing flowers - and finally food - on the moon. Paragon, which is a partner of NASA in experiments at the International Space Station, calls it a ""Lunar Oasis "" This is a closed greenhouse placed in a metal box. It is designed to safely land a laboratory plant on the moon surface, and protect it while it grows. The small greenhouse is to be sent up into space by Odyssey Moon Ltd, which takes part in the Google Lunar X Prize. This competition offers $ 20 million to any company which can send up, land and operate a lunar rover on the moon surface. Leaders of Paragon say future testing of the ""Lunar Oasis"" will be driven by Odyssey's flight schedule, which will not happen until 2012 at the earliest. When it is sent up, the greenhouse will have the seeds of cabbage inside it. Because they go from seed to flower in just 14 days, they can complete their life cycle in a lunar night. ""Growing plants on the Moon or Mars seems so far away, but it is important that we do this research now,"" Paragon president Jane Poynter said. ""It takes a long time to do a lot of research."""

What happened when the author was 4?	In 1943, when I was 4, my parents moved from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to Fairbanks, Alaska, where adventure was never very far away. We arrived in the summer, just in time to enjoy the midnight sun. All that sunlight was fantastic for Mom's vegetable garden. Working in the garden at midnight tended to throw her timing off, so she didn't care much about my bedtime. Dad was a Railway Express agent and Mom was his clerk. That left me in a mess. I usually managed to find some trouble to get into. Once I had a little Are going in the dirt basement of a hotel. I had tried to light a barrel of paint but couldn't really get a good fire going. The smoke got pretty bad, though, and when 1 made my exit, a crowd and the police were there to greet me. The policemen took my matches and drove me Mom and Dad were occupied in the garden and Dad told the police to keep me, and they did! I had a tour of the prison before Mom rescued me. 1 hadn't turned 5 yet. As I entered kindergarten, the serious cold began to set in. Would it surprise you to know that I soon left part of my tongue on a metal handrail at school? As for Leonhard Seppala, famous as a dog sledder , I think I knew him well because I was taken for a ride with his white dog team one Sunday. At the time I didn't realize what a superstar he was, but I do remember the ride well. I was wrapped heavily and well sheltered from the freezing and blowing weather. In 1950, we moved back to Coeur d'Alene, but we got one more Alaskan adventure when Leonhard invited us eight years later by paying a visit to Idaho to attend a gathering of former neighbors of Alaska.

Taobao is _ .	"""Who needs a shopping mall if you have Taobao?"" says Wang Lin, 28, a writer in Beijing. Taobao, China's largest online shopping site, is becoming an important part of Wang Lin's life. She spends a lot of money on Taobao. Many Chinese internet users like Wang Lin find the happiness of online shopping. Most online shoppers are students or young workers. More women shop on line than men. Clothing and home-use things are the most popular on line. It was reported that Chinese people spent more than 250 billion yuan on line shopping last year, 80% in Taobao. Taobao means ""looking for good"" in Chinese. People can find almost everything they need on Taobao, from clothes to books, from toys to DVD players. You may worry about the security of online shopping, Wang Lin said, ""It's very safe. If you don't get the things from the sellers or are not satisfied with them, the shop owner will not get the money. You can also get your money back if you don't want them."

In many ways learning has the power to transform us, so which of the following does NOT belong to the ways?	During the last century we have moved from the Industrial Age through the Information Age to the Knowledge Age. The ability to obtain and apply the right knowledge effectively will become a key skill in the next century. Our ability will no longer be judged only by knowledge gained in the past, but will also be measured by our ability to learn and adapt in the future. Learning isn't just about economic success, however. It is the key to achieving our full potential(,). Human beings are particularly adapted to learn and we have the ability to do so throughout our lives. Learning has the power to change us. Specifically, we can become more successful. Learning can enable us to solve problems and change our attitudes. It makes us more interesting to be with. It can be enormous fun. It can also be very challenging. We all have the ability, at any age, to change our lives through learning. Our survival in the twenty-first century as individuals, organizations and nations, will depend on our ability to learn. A learning population is healthier, more tolerant(,), independent and fulfilled. Learning can take place in a range of styles: anytime, anywhere, anyhow. None of us learn in isolation(,). There are a whole range of factors that can affect us in learning. The key factors affecting people's learning include: *their resources *their image of learning *the rewards associated with any learning activity *the availability of information about learning opportunities *the climate created by government and employers in which learning takes place	['We can have a longer life.']
This 1,200-mile race is unusual because _ .	"Each year on the first Saturday in March, a group of middle-aged men and a few women gather at sunrise on a beach near prefix = st1 /St. Petersburg,Fla.Above the high-water line are more than 50 small boats. At exactly 7 a.m., Steve Isaac stands at the water's edge with his arm raised and yells: ""Go!"" Most of the boats are part of the Everglades Challenge. They head for a finish line many days and 300 miles to the south, at Key Largo. But this Saturday, for the first time, 10 of the brave mariners--including a journalist, whose progress will be available online--will compete in the world's toughest small boat race, called the Ultimate Florida Challenge. Instead of finishing at Key Largo, the 10 boaters will continue around the state, heading north past Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, and Jacksonville, then down the Suwannee River, eventually passing most of Florida before arriving back at the beach near St. Petersburg. It will be 1,200 miles of head winds and burning sun. But it will also take the challengers through some of the most impressive scenery in North America. The rules are no-nonsense: First one back to the beach wins. The voyage must be completed within a month. Human power or sails, only. No motors. No rides in cars or tows from power boats. No help from family or friends. And at least once a day, participants are required to acknowledge by cell phone or radio that they are still alive. The race will be a replay of the tale of the tortoise and the rabbit. The trick, if there is one, is to be a tortoise and just keep moving forward. But the one-month deadline means that being too much of a tortoise may result in failure. So challengers have to be a little bit of a rabbit, as well."	['it will be more challenging']
The writer's trip to the two seas was full of _ .	Two European Summer Must 'Seas' When you think of summer,the beach,clear water, sunny skies, and relaxing days are a few things that come to mind, and two of the best places to experience these summer feels are two gorgeous European bodies of water: the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea! These two incredible Seas hold some of my favorite travel memories and I would revisit each one in a heart beat! The Mediterranean Sea The Mediterranean Sea can be accessed from various European countries as well as a few North African countries. And while many think of visiting Ibiza, Malta, or the Greek islands to experience the Mediterranean, my Mediterranean beach days came while visiting the seaside city of Marseille in the South of France! Marseille was a lovely city with easy access to the Sea, also with pretty sandy beaches. The gorgeous crystal clear blue water made it unlike any beach day in America! Not only were the beaches amazing, but the city of Marseille was adorable and filled with numerous cute shops and seaside restaurants. And the Mediterranean-style food was delicious! The Adriatic Sea The Adriatic Sea is equally as stunning and surely worth a visit! The Croatian coast has numerous beach clubs, some private and some public, that tourists are able to visit and you can experience the beauty of the Adriatic Sea there! Zrce Novalja, a Croatian seaside town I visited, was impressively featured by the rather rocky beach in place of sand. The rocks were small and smooth, making swimming in the sea and wading in the water just as easy as sandy beaches! Plus the locals in Croatia are also extremely friendly, making the experience even more memorable.	['wonderful experiences']
Many people don't use humour more in the workplace because _ .	A survey by an international temporary service agency found that U. S. managers believe that people with a sense of humour do better at their jobs, compared with those who have little or no sense of humour. In fact, about 96 percent of those surveyed said people with a sense of humour do better. The survey went on to point out that the results suggest that a sense of humour may help light-hearted employees keep their jobs during tough times. And, what's more, it may push them up the corporate ladder past their humourless colleagues. Why? It seems that those with a sense of humour are better communicators and better team players. Studies have shown that happy workers are more productive. In fact, a researcher at California State University found that humour could help the employees to release tension. Research done by psychologist Dr. Ashton Trice at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia showed that humour helps us think. When people feel stuck on important projects, they tend to feel angry or depressed. According to Dr. Trice's research, taking time out to laugh can help us to get rid of negative feelings and allow us to return to a task or move on to another project unaffected by past defeat. If humour is really this important, then why don't we use it more often on the job? Most likely, the main reason is that many people are unaware of the positive effects of humour in the workplace. However, it is important to realize that some humour is not suitable for the workplace, and that it is often used at wrong times.	"[""they don't know the positive effects of humour""]"
Paul felt sad when he lost _ one day.	"As a young child, I was quiet and shy. I was also sick for a long time. My parents worked, and I spent a lot of time at my grandparent's home. While my grandmother cleaned the house and cooked, my grandfather played with me. I was six when my grandfather died. A few months before he died, he gave me a beautiful blue and white blanket . I loved the blanket very much because it made me think of my grandfather. But after a few years, the blanket didn't look very good. It had holes and was dirty. I didn't want to throw the blanket away, so my mother made the blanket into a book bag. I was proud of the book bag, and I used it to carry my books to school every day for a few years. Then the book bag was broken. I begged my mother to make something out of it. She made it into a pencil-box. After a few months, the pencil-box was broken, too. By then I could sew , and I made the pencil-box into a small wallet. I used it for three years, but one day I lost it. I felt sad. My friends and family said, ""Forget about it, Paul. You can't make something out of nothing."" I thought about it for a while. I decided my friends and family were wrong. There was a way to make something out of nothing. I wrote down the story of my grandfather's blanket."	['the wallet']

Misguided by the parental reward system,children easily believe _ .	Earlier this year,my oldest daughter got braces on her teeth,and let's just say she did not go quietly into that dentist's chair. Fear and hate pretty much describe the days leading up to her first appointment. So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit, I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben & Jerry's for an ice cream reward. Two weeks later, we returned to the scene of the crime.The dentist spent about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way. Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order. She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we got her teeth checked. Apparently,she's not alone. According to some parenting experts, kids are easily addicted to a benefitproducing system of parental rewards and bribes --not all ice creams, candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children novel prizes just to let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game. While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay,the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do, no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer, make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving.

How long did the whole event probably last from the moment Bieber came to the hotel to the arrival of some armed officers ?	"One of Britain's bravest women told yesterday how she helped to catch suspected police killer David Bieber --- and was thanked with flowers by the police. It was also said that she could be in line for a share of up to PS30,000 reward money . Vicki Brown , 30 , played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt . Vicki , who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years , told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly. Then she waited alone for three hours while armed police prepared to storm the building. She said : "" I was very nervous . But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park I was so glad they were there."" The alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 8 pm the day before New Year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face.

Why should we not feel embarrassed when talking to ourselves?	"A popular saying goes, ""Sticks and stone may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."" However, that's not really true. Words have the power to build us up or tear us down. It doesn't matter if the words come from someone else or ourselves - the positive and negative effects are just as lasting. We all talk to ourselves sometimes. We're usually too embarrassed to admit it, though. But we really shouldn't be, because more and more experts believe talking to ourselves out loud is a healthy habit. This ""self-talk"" helps us motivate ourselves, remember things, solve problems, and calm ourselves down. Beware, though, that as much as 77% of self-talk tends to be negative. So in order to stay positive, we should only speak words of encouragement to ourselves. We should also be quick to _ . The next time you finish a project, do well in a test, or finally clean your room, join me in saying, ""Good job!"" Words possess power because of their lasting effects. Many of us regret something we once said. And we remember unkind words said to us! Before speaking, we should always ask ourselves: Is it true? Is it loving? Is it needed? If what we want to say doesn't pass this test, then it's better left unsaid. Words possess power: both positive and negative. Those around us receive encouragement when we speak positively. We can offer hope, build self-esteem and motive others to do their best. Negative words destroy all those things. Will we use our words to hurt or to heal? The choice is ours. ks5u"	['Talking to ourselves is believed to be good for our health.']

The main idea of the passage is that _ .	"Bicycles, roller skates and skateboards are dangerous. I still have scars on my knees from my childhood run-ins with various wheeled devices. Admittedly, I was a foolish kid, but I'm glad I didn't spend my childhood trapped indoors to protect me from any injury. ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger."" But parents can't handle it when teenagers put this theory into practice. And now technology has become the new field for the age-old battle between adults and their freedom-seeking kids. Locked indoors, unable to get on their bicycles and hang out with their friends, teens have turned to social media and their mobile phones to gossip and socialize with their friends. What they do online often mirrors what they might otherwise do if their mobility weren't so heavily restricted in the age of helicopter parenting. Social media and smartphones have become so popular in recent years because teens need a place to call their own. They want the freedom to explore their identity and the world around them. Instead of climbing out of windows, they jump online. As teens have moved online, parents have projected their fears onto the Internet, imagining all the potential dangers that youth might face. Rather than helping teens develop strategies to deal with public life and the potential risks of interacting with others, fearful parents have focused on tracking, monitoring and blocking. These approaches don't help teens develop the skills they need to manage complex social situations. ""Protecting"" kids may feel like the right thing to do, but it denies teens the chances of learning as they come of age in a technology-soaked world. The key to helping youth in the modern digital life isn't more restrictions. It's freedom -- plus communication. Urban theorist Jane Jacobs used to argue that the safest neighborhoods were those where communities collectively took interest in and paid attention to what happened on the streets. Safety didn't come from surveillance cameras or keeping everyone indoors but from a collective willingness to watch out for one another and be present as people struggled. The same is true online. What makes the digital street safe is when teens and adults collectively agree to open their eyes and pay attention, communicate and work together to deal with difficult situations.

According to the writer, what is the best way to calm down after being hurt?	"When someone has deeply hurt you, it can be extremely difficult to let go of your _ . But forgiveness is possible and it can be surprisingly helpful to your physical and mental health. Indeed, research has shown that people who forgive report more energy, better appetite and better sleep patterns. ""People who forgive show less anger and more hopefulness,"" says Dr. Frederic Luskin, who wrote the book Forgive for Good. ""So it can help save on the wear and tear, and allow people to feel more energetic."" So when someone has hurt you, calm yourself first. Take a couple of breaths and think of something that gives you pleasure: a beautiful scene in nature, someone you love. Don't wait for an apology. ""Many times the person who hurt you may never think of apologizing,"" says Dr. Luskin. ""They may have wanted to hurt you or they just don't see things the same way. So if you wait for people to apologize, you could be waiting a very long time."" Keep in mind that forgiveness does not necessarily mean accepting the action of the person who upset you. Mentally going over your hurt gives power to the person who brought you pain. Instead, learn to look for the love, beauty and kindness around you. Finally, try to see things from the other person' s perspective. You may realize that he or she was acting out of ignorance , fear even love. To gain perspective, you may want to write a letter to yourself from that person's point of view."	['Think about pleasant things and forget about the hurt.']
During an earthquake, which of the following things should you NOT do?	"An earthquake is a trembling or shaking of the ground caused by the sudden release of energy stored in the rocks below the surface. Generally, earthquakes last only seconds. Strong ground shaking during a medium to large earthquake generally lasts about 10 to 30 seconds. Aftershocks can occur once in a while for weeks or even months. Many people think that there is an ""earthquake season"" or a kind of "" earthquake weather "".As a matter of fact, there isn't. Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year and at time of day or night. Earthquakes occur under all weather conditions-sunny, wet. or cold without any special weather tendency . Also, you don't need to worry that the ground will open up and swallow people when earthquakes occur. Open ground cracks may form during an earthquake, for example, to land sliding or ground falling. However, such cracks tend to be open gaps (they don't "" swallow"") that a person could stand in afterwards. The safest place in an earthquake is an open field because buildings and falling objects can injure or kill you. If you are indoors, when you feel the ground start to shake, take cover immediately under a table or strong piece of furniture, placing something between falling objects and yourself. Don't "" attempt to use the stairs or an elevator to get out of the building.."	['Take an elevator.']

Many countries around the world have harvest festivals. This is the best time for the harvest. Every year in the United States, Thanksgiving Day is on the fourth Thursday of November. But in Canada, people have Thanksgiving Day on the second Monday in October, because Canada is north of the United States, and it is colder, the harvest comes earlier in the year. The harvest brings a lot of food to the people. On Thanksgiving Day, people in Canada and America like to have a big meal with their friends and family--just like Chinese people do at Mid-Autumn Festival.

Let Jim and me choose the cards. I can't wait. It's fun! "" When Robert shouted out, his mother had already put all the cards on their big table.

Jim and Robert chose two cards for each day from Monday to Friday. Then they would hang them on the weekday task board. Jim likes to clean the bathroom, so he picked up the card ""clean the bathroom "". Robert loves to make the bed so he picked up his favorite card. Jim again picked up ""wash vegetables"" and Robert chose "" feed the fish "". Soon the two boys were happy to take away all the cards. To help the children do housework, their mother thought hard and came up with this idea. Of course, the couple did the housework on the weekends and left Jim and Robert two days free."

What's the best title of the passage?	"I've loved my mother's desk since I was just tall enough to sit above the top of it when mother sat writing letters.

I only knew that I had written it, and I could stop trying to make her into someone she was not. But the present of her desk told me, as she'd never been able to, that she was pleased that writing was my chosen work. I cleaned the desk carefully and found some papers inside-a photo of my father and a one-page letter, folded and refolded many times. It was my letter.

According to Sandy, people multitask because of their _ .	"In our daily life now, you may often find some people like to do several things together at the same time. They may watch TV while playing cell phones, and they may work while chatting with their close friends. As a new research suggests, people who multitask all the time may be the worst at doing two things at once. The findings, based on performances and self-evaluations by about 300 college students, indicate that many people multitask not out of a desire to increase productivity, but because they are easily distracted and can't focus on one activity. And ""those people turn out to be the worst at handling different things,"" said David Sandy, a psychologist at the University of Utah. Sandy and his colleagues gave the students a set of tests and asked them to report how often they multitasked, how good they thought they were at it, and how sensation-seeking or impulsive they were. They then evaluated the participants' multitasking ability with a tricky mental task that required the students to do simple mathematical calculations while remembering a set of letters. Not surprisingly, the scientists said, most people thought they were better than average at multitasking, and those who thought they were better at it were more likely to report using a cell phone while driving or viewing multiple kinds of media at once. But those who frequently deal with many things at the same time were found to perform the worst at the actual multitasking test. They also were more likely to admit to sensation-seeking and impulsive behavior, which connects with how easily people get bored and distracted. ""People multitask not because it's going to lead to greater productivity, but because they're distractible, and they get sucked into things that are not as important,"" Sandy said. Adam, a researcher at the University of California, who was not a member of the research group, said one limitation of the study was that it couldn't find out whether people who start out less focused tend toward multitasking or whether people's recognizing and understanding abilities change as a result of multitasking. The findings do suggest, however, why the sensation-seekers who multitask the most may enjoy risky distracted driving. ""People who are multitasking are generally less sensitive to risky situations,"" said Paul, another researcher not in the group. ""This may partly explain why people go in for these situations even though they're dangerous."	['inability to concentrate on one task']

Sometimes it is helpful if you know what common proverbs mean. Here are a few examples: Once bitten, twice shy. If a dog bites me, I shall be twice as careful in future when I see it. This proverb is also used to apply to many things and not only to dogs. If you have been cheated at a shop, you will not go to the same shop again. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. If I am a hunter, trying to catch birds, it is better to catch one bird than to see two birds in a bush but not be able to catch them. Thus this means that what you have already got is better than the chance of being able to get something bigger in the future. Too many cooks spoil the broth(soup). When too many people do something together, they get in each other's way and cannot do a good job. To pour oil on troubled waters Is to try to calm things down. Oil is lighter than water. If a ship is in trouble at sea, another ship may come to help it. The second ship can send small boats to rescue people. However, it may first pour oil on the sea to make the sea less rough. Don't be a dog in a manger . Means "" Don't be selfish."" In a stable , the manger is the place where the horse's food is put. Sometimes a dog will sleep in the manger and bard when a horse comes to get its food. The dog does not want to eat the hay in the manger but it will not let the horse eat it.

He is sitting on a fence between two opposing sides, perhaps waiting to see which side will win. He who pays the piper calls the tune. A piper is a musician . The man who employs or pays a musician can say what tunes the man will play. Thus this means that if a man provides the money for a plan, he can say how it will be carried out.

What is the unique advantage of the Bronze Yan?	"How did the ancient Chinese keep food warm in winter? Facilities like electric rice cookers, microwaves, and electric kettles, make it easy for people to keep food warm and enjoy a comfortable winter. So how did Chinese people in ancient times keep food warm in winter without these? In fact, ancient Chinese people used their own methods of heat preservation as early as the Shang and Zhou dynasties. * ""Wen Ding"", ancient rice cooker One of the major functions of an electric rice cooker is to keep food warm. The ""Wen Ding"", an ancient cooking container, served the same purpose, but instead of using electric energy, the ancient cooking container, served the same purpose, but instead of using electric energy, the ancient cooking container preserved heart by burning fuels like charcoal. The ""Wen Ding"" unearthed in Nanjing in 1989 is thought to be the oldest of its kind discovered in China, dating back to the Stone Age, The craftsmanship of making the ""Wen Ding"" was developed in the Bronze Age. The bronze Ding from Shang and Zhou dynasties took on different shapes and structures. * ""Ran LU"", ancient small hot pot The ""Ran LU"" is a small size cooking vessel made of bronze, which can be divided into three parts. A charcoal stove forms the main structure, with a bottom tray to hold charcoal ashes, and a movable cup at the top. Some experts have concluded that the vessel's structure suggests it may have been used as a small hot pot and that these vessels became popular in the Warring States Period(475--221 BC) *Bronze You, ancient kettle The Bronze You was one of the most common wine containers during the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The Bronze You can also be used to warm wine. For example, the Bronze You with beast mask design, unearthed in Jiangxi province, has an opening where charcoals could be placed. Just as people today can't do without an electric kettle, the Bronze You allowed people to enjoy a hot drink. *Bronze Yan, ancient steamer Although the ""Wen Ding"" was effective at keeping food warm, the ancient Chinese people later found that its burning produced pollution. As a result, the Bronze Yan was made with a two-tier structure and used to steam rice and other grains. After the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25-AD 220), further improvements to the Bronze Yan led to the modern-day steamer."	['It is environment-friendly.']
What is the main idea for the passage?	"Blogs are being used more and more by teachers. Many Internet services now offer free and easy ways to create personal Web pages. Through comments on blogs, or Web logs, teachers can share their classroom experiences. They can exchange ideas and discuss successes and failures. They can debate educational policies. Or they can just sympathize with each other. A teacher in the American state of North Carolina recently wrote on her blog: ""Apparently the teachers at my school use too much paper. So my principal yelled at everyone at the last staff meeting for, like, ten minutes. Now, I've just been told, we are not getting anymore paper for the rest of the year.""

Which of the following statements is NOT true?	Play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination and physical, cognitive , and emotional strength. Play is important to healthy brain development. Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles. Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate, and to resolve conflicts. Ideally, much of play involves adults, but when play is controlled by adults, children acquiesce to adult rules and concerns and lose some of the benefits play offers them, particularly in developing creativity, leadership, and group skills. In contrast to passive entertainment, play builds active, healthy bodies. In fact, it has been suggested that encouraging unstructured play may be an exceptional way to increase physical activity levels in children, which is one important strategy in the resolution of the obesity problem. Children's development is critically influenced by appropriate, affective relationships with loving and consistent caregivers as they relate to children through play. When parents observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play, they are given a unique opportunity to see the world from their children's vantage point as the child navigates a world perfectly created just to fit his or her needs. The interactions that occur through play tell children that parents are fully paying attention to them and help to build enduring relationships. Parents who have the opportunity to look at their children's world learn to communicate more effectively with their children and are given another setting to offer guidance. Less verbal children may be able to express their views, giving their parents an opportunity to gain a fuller understanding of their perspective. Quite simply, play offers parents a wonderful opportunity to engage fully with their children. Play is essential to the academic environment. It ensures that the school setting attends to the social and emotional development of children as well as their cognitive development. It has been shown to help children adjust to the school setting and even to strengthen children's learning willingness. Social-emotional learning is best integrated with academic learning; it is concerning if some of the forces that enhance children's ability to learn are improved at the expense of others. Play and unscheduled time that allow for peer interactions are important components of social-emotional learning.	"[""Adults shouldn't be involved in children's play.""]"
What can be the best title of the passage?	You never forget your first whale. The impact it makes upon you is huge and life is never quite the same again. My first whale was a 40ft grey, off the coast of California in 1979, and I've been a whale addict ever since. Now I have to go whale watching regularly just to survive normal daily life. I may be crazy but I am certainly not alone. The world is filled with whale watchers: since its beginnings in the mid-fifties, whale watching has grown dramatically and now more than 13 million people join organized whale watching trips every year. As a faithful whale watcher, all your holidays center on whales. The only books you read are ones about whales; you wear whale T-shirts, and every time you meet your friends you talk about whales. So what is it about these larger-than-life animals that makes them so special? Their enormous size is one possible explanation: imagine sitting in a small boat next to a blue whale almost as long as a Boeing 737.The fact that we know so little about them is another possibility: modern technology has taken us to the moon and beyond, yet we are only just beginning to understand these extraordinary forms of intelligent life on our own planet. Planning and patience are just two essential requirements for successful whale watching. Planning is needed because there are certain whale hot spots--where you have the best chance of seeing them--and because the larger species tend to be on their way from feeding areas to breeding grounds, so rarely do they stay in one place for more than a few months at a time. Patience is necessary because, even under the best conditions, whales can be tricky to find. However, most commercial whale watching trips have a surprisingly high success rate because they tend to concentrate on well-known whale populations at peak seasons.	['Tips on Whale Watching']
The example of the Youth Olympics is meant to illustrate that _	There is a cry of rage, and a tennis racket crashes to the ground. Jake,age 7,has just lost another match and is now in tears beside the court. His sister Sally, just one year older, looks at her mother and rolls her eyes: it is hard to enjoy winning when this keeps happening. It is not an unusual situation, and it is one reason why many people argue that competition is bad for children. However,the truth is that competitive games are a valuable preparation for adult life. Games with winners and losers give children the chance to experience life's ups and downs .Take Jake, for example.Even though he is unhappy now, he will probably be smiling and laughing with his sister in a few minutes, just like the last time this happened . Gradually, he will learn that the world does not end when you lose a game. Eventually, he may even be able to lose with a smile on his face. This is an important lesson. Not everything in life goes the way you would like, and it is important to know how to handle disappointment t when it occurs. Children who participate in competitive games develop qualities that allow them to succeed in the complex world of adult life. For example, one of the missions of the Youth Olympic Games is to inspire young people to adopt the Olympic values, which include striving, Determination and optimism. Competition creates a desire to do better. Children have to learn to succeed in a competitive atmosphere in order to take advantage of opportunities in the future .Although it is possible to win by chance occasionally, people who win and keep winning work very hard to achieve their success. On the negative side,there are those who will say that competition actually encourages some values , which does happen . It is common to see sports competition in which the desire to win has replaced the desire to have fun. You may even see very young children playing violently----like the superstars they see on TV. While the bad behavior of young athletes is troubling, the problem is not the competition itself. In reality, the blame lies with the professional players who are bad role models for these children. In fact, a recent study of young athletes by the school of Physical Health Education at the University of Wyoming showed an improvement in mood after exercise, athletes were less depressed or tense. Of course, there are parents who argue that children of Jake's age are too young to handle the pain of losing. But whether we like it or not, adult life is very competitive , and keeping children away from competition does them more harm than good. If children do not learn how to compete, they will be defeated by people who can. It is an unfortunate fact of life: whether ten or a hundred people want the same job, there can be only one winner .Wouldn't you want your child to be that person?

Why did the team try to get rid of the dog during the race?	"Exhausted,covered in mud and desperately hungry,a team of Swedish athletes sat down for a meal as they prepared to take on a dangerous 20-mile trek through the Ecuadorian rainforest. As they opened their canned meat,a tired Mikael Lindnord noticed a miserable stray dog staring at him out of the corner of his eye. Feeling sorry for him,he fed the dog a meatball and thought nothing of it,but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them--and he didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship,the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name Arthur. Every tiring task the team face,Arthur would do the same.He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers,dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee--deep mud during treks. Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety--he refused to leave.This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out. After six days the team finished the race,and the dog had suffered.They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Lindord thought to himself that after their experience,they could not leave Arthur,so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden.He applied to the Swedish Board of Agriculture and was made to wait to see if his application was successful.After a tense few days,the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. Lindord said:""I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship.Instead,I got a new friend."""	['They were concerned about his safety.']
Which of the following is the best title of this passage?	"A few days ago, I was sitting in a Thai restaurant enjoying a meal when I got on a phone call from a friend I hadn't spoken to in a long time. In my enthusiasm and excitement, I talked quite louder than usual voice and in Spanish, my mother tongue. A few minutes into the call, an old lady sitting at the table beside mine got up, seemingly offended, and asked the restaurant staff to relocate a table as far away as possible from this man who seemed to be impolite. I sank in my seat out of embarrassment. I ended the call soon afterwards and felt the urge to apologize. Before getting up, I looked around to see where she was and she was at the table farthest away from me. I noticed that the lady was alone and staring out the window. I found a tinge of sadness or anxiety and perhaps a desire for aloneness and peace. But I had obviously destroyed it minutes earlier. Right then I abandoned my plan for a conventional apologetic gesture. Seeing those funny smile cards in my wallet, I took one out and wrote some words to express my apology. On signing my restaurant bill, I asked a waiter to secretly charge the lady's meal to me and hand her the smile card instead of her bill. Did she take it the wrong way, I wondered? Did she get confused? Did she refuse the anonymous offer? And so on. I just waited and felt nervous to learn the outcome. To my pleasant surprise, things turned out the best possible way. The waiter approached me in a joy, telling me, ""In the many times she had dined here before, I had never seen the old lady smile as she did when receiving the smile card and the $0 bill. She thanked me even though I explained that someone else did the job."""	['A Smile Card for a Sincere Apology']

Perhaps because the program had become so widespread and successful, TOD had been criticized for excluding boys.and it was expanded in 2003to include boys.The program's official website states that the program was changed in order to provide both boys and girls with opportunities to explore careers at an age when they are more flexible in tenns of gender stereotyped roles.""We should also show boys that becoming a child care provider is as acceptable a choice as becoming a police officer or CEO,"" added Sara K.Gould.executive director of the NFW."

She looked for it carefully in all her bags, but she couldn't find it. She had only a ten-pound note with her. She found a place to change her English money. On her way back to the hotel, Ann bought some cheese, some bread and some oranges. She told the manager that she didn't eat Spanish food except for breakfast, because she knew the price of hotels included breakfast. Other tourists visited places of great interest in Spain. Ann said she wasn't well. In fact, her holiday wasn't bad, except that she was hungry. After all a piece of fruit for lunch, and bread and cheese for supper isn't very much. especially not for two weeks. On the last day of her holiday, Jane, one of the tourists asked Ann why she never ate with them in the hotel restaurant. The food was delicious. Ann told her all about her money problem. Jane looked at her for a moment, and then said, ""But didn't you know the price of this hotel includes everything?"""	"[""she didn't know the price of that hotel included everything""]"

Kenneth Boulding and the content of his essay at the beginning of this passage are meant to .	"Cowboy or spaceman? A dilemma for a children's party, perhaps. But also a question for economists, argued Kenneth Boulding, a British economist, in an essay published in 1966. We have run our economies, he warned, like cowboys on the open grassland: taking and using the world's resources, confident that more lies over the horizon. But the Earth is less a grassland than a spaceship--a closed system, alone in space, carrying limited supplies. We need, said Boulding, an economics that takes seriously the idea of environmental limits. In the half century since his essay, a new movement has responded to his challenge. ""Ecological economists"", as they call themselves, want to revolutionise its aims and assumptions. What do they say--and will their ideas achieve lift-off? To its advocators, ecological economics is neither ecology nor economics, but a mix of both. Their starting point is to recognise that the human economy is part of the natural world. Our environment, they note, is both a source of resources and a sink for wastes. But it is ignored in conventional textbooks, where neat diagrams trace the flows between firms, households and the government as though nature did not exist. That is a mistake, say ecological economists. There are two ways our economies can grow, ecological economists point out: through technological change, or through more intensive use of resources. Only the former, they say, is worth having. They are suspicious of GDP, a crude measure which does not take account of resource exhaustion, unpaid work, and countless other factors. In its place they advocate moreholistic approaches, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), a composite index that includes things like the cost of pollution, deforestation and car accidents. While GDP has kept growing, global GPI per person peaked in 1978: by destroying our environment we are making ourselves poorer, not richer. The solution, says Herman Daly, a former World Bank economist and eco-guru, is a ""steady-state"" economy, where the use of materials and energy is held constant. Mainstream economists are unimpressed. The GPI, they point out, is a subjective measure. And talk of limits to growth has had a bad press since the days of Thomas Malthus, a gloomy 18th century cleric who predicted, wrongly, that overpopulation would lead to famine. Human beings find solutions to some of the most annoying problems. But ecological economists warn against self-satisfaction. In 2009 a paper in Nature, a scientific journal, argued that human activity is already overstepping safe planetary boundaries on issues such as biodiversity and climate change. That suggests that ecological economists are at least asking some important questions, even if their answers turn out to be wrong."	['introduce ecological economists and ecologist economics']
Why was Lord Northwood surprised?	"Pat O'Burke was a poor Irishman with a large family, and one morning, waking up very early from cold and hunger, he decided to go shooting in a wood near his cottage. The wood belonged to Lord Northwood, a rich gentleman, Pat had no _ to go there, but in it there were swarms of rabbits and flocks of birds that were good to eat, and Pat determined to take the risk. Suddenly he saw the owner, with a group of friends, coming towards him in the wood. There was a look of anger on Lord Northwood's face as he caught sight of the gun in Pat's hands. Pat's heart sank with fear, but he saw there was no hope of escape, so he walked boldly up to the group and said to Lord Northwood, ""Good morning, sir, and what has brought you out so early this morning?"" Lord Northwood, rather surprised, said he and his friends were taking a little exercise to get an appetite for their breakfast. Then, looking at Pat with suspicion , he said, ""but why are you out so early in the morning?"" ""Well, sir"" said Pat, ""I just came out to see if I could get a breakfast for my appetite."" The whole crowed burst into laughter at Pat's ready wit(,), and with a smile Lord Northwood walked on, leaving Pat to try his luck with the rabbits."

Which of the following can help children develop social skills in a game?	Children like to imagine they are someone else in a game. As a parent you might never guess how it can benefit your child. It helps your child: Develop Social Skills As children play pretend games,they explore relationships between family members,friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact.Playing doctors,they imagine how physicians care for their patients.Imaginative play helps develop empathy with others.If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet,they are better able to help those in need.They become more willing to play fair,to share,and to cooperate. Build Selfconfidence Young children have very little control over their lives.Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers or a super hero defending the planet is inspiring to children.It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential. Promote Intellectual Growth Using imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically.This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numbers symbolize groups of objects,letters symbolize sounds,and so on. Practice Language Skills Kids who pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps increase their vocabulary,improve sentence structure and develop communication skills. Get Rid of Fears Pretending can help children get rid of their fears and worries.When children roleplay the big,bad monster under the bed,they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad.

When Annabelle wanted to help Charlotte, Charlotte felt _ .	"Annabelle Smith and her two best friends, Samantha and Kristy, loved going to Sand City School. Mrs. Lemming, their teacher, would read them a story. That Monday afternoon, Mrs. Lemming read them a story called Super Sophie Saves the Day. After school, Annabelle, Samantha and Kristy walked home together. ""I decide that from now on I'm going to be a superhero like Sophie,"" Annabelle told her friends. ""You mean heroine,"" Kristy said. ""You're a girl, Annabelle."" The next day Kristy and Samantha picked Annabelle up on their way to school. Annabelle had a red towel taped to her blue shirt. ""I am Super Annabelle,"" Annabelle said. ""I'll save someone on the way to school."" Charlotte, another second-grader, walked past the girls. Her sweater was tied around her waist. She ran a little faster, and her sweater was nearly on the ground. Annabelle wondered what she would do. Giving her a dirty look, Charlotte ran away. Annabelle walked into her father's study when she got home. She had a homework question for him. A note on her father's desk said he was lending some books to Charlotte's father. She noticed a magazine on his desk that said Go Green. ""Homework can wait,"" Annabelle thought. ""Maybe Charlotte goes green!"" In the woods, Annabelle saw a man cutting down a tree. Trees were good for the environment. She prevented him from cutting down the tree, and then she fell on the hard ground. Annabelle walked farther in the woods, where she found Charlotte picking up litter. Annabelle said, ""You are the second-grade's hero, Charlotte."" Charlotte stared at Annabelle. ""I'm picking up litter to make the earth a better place,"" she said. ""I don't care about being famous."" Annabelle felt slightly ashamed of herself."	['angry']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"Our voice gives away a lot of information about ourselves. It can tell us our gender and age. And now, scientists say that it can also tell us our height. Scientists at Washington University, Indiana University and University of California found that listeners could accurately tell the height of speakers, just by their voices. And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. ""The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,"" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest. The listeners were able to identify the tall people 62.17% of time, much higher than a lucky guess. Why not try the experiment yourself? Find out if your tall friends have deeper voices."	"[""Listeners' ability to identify taller speaker is much higher than a lucky guess.""]"
Which is the best title for the passage?	"Well, what a bonus! Lots of us are using technology to find rides, and not just to school. It's awkward to call a friend and ask for a ride, and half the time they'll say, ""Sorry,my car is full."" But with Twitter and Facebook, you just tweet Ashleys Pool Party and look for other people heading the same way. It may sound risky, but many teens stay within their own social circles to find rides, and don't branch out beyond friends of friends when asking on Twitter. For me, I only rideshare with people I know, but to some young people, especially those taking longer trips, stranger danger is less of a concern. The sharing economy got big during the recession . It allows people to access more goods and services using technology, while also allowing them to share cost. And that, technology, for me, is what the car was for my mom, a gateway to more freedom. According to the researchers at the University of Michigan,30 years ago, eight in ten American 18-year-olds had a driver's license. Today it's six in ten. So it's not that surprising that on my 16th birthday I wasn't rushing to get a license. All I wanted was an IPhone, Juliet Schor (Sociology professor at Boston College) knows people of my age love being connected and for young people driving means they have to disconnect from their technology, and that's negative. So if they could sit in the passenger side and still be connected, that's going to be a plus. To me, another plus is ridesharing represents something much bigger than trying to save money. I see it as evidence that people still depend on each other. My generation shares their cars and apartments the way neighbors used to share cups of sugar. For the system to work, we still need our own cars. But until I get my own version of the silver Super Beetle, you can find me on twitter."	['Teens use Twitter to share rides.']
Which of the following statements is NOT true?	Parents whose children show a special interest in a particular sport feel very difficult to make a decision about their children's careers. Should they allow their children to train to become top sports men or women? For many children it means starting school work very young, and going out with friends and other interests have to _ . It's very difficult to explain to a young child why he or she has to train five hours a day, even at the weekend, when most of his or her friends are playing. Another problem is of course money. In many countries money for training is available from government for the very best young sports men and women. If this help can not be given, it means that it is the parents who have to find the time and the money to support their child's development---and sports clothes, transport to competitions, special equipment, etc. can all be very expensive. Many parents are worried that it is dangerous to start serious training in a sport at an early age. Some doctors agree that young muscles may be damaged by training before they are properly developed. Professional trainers, however, believe that it is only by training young that you can reach the top as a successful sports person. It is clear that very few people do reach the top, and both parents and children should be prepared for failure even after many years of training.

According to the passage, we are different from animals because of _ .	"join us together and set us apart. Today, our society has a terrible lack of values. Here are some social values that everyone needs. *Respect Respect means to respect others in everyday life. Even if you are against a person, it is important to have respect. It is this respect that makes us human. Without this respect, we become animals. We need to respect our friends for our friendships. We even need to respect our enemies, because they help us to grow up and be stronger. Respect is one of the crucial values in a relationship. *Love Love is everything. With love in our hearts, we feel no need to hurt another. With love in our hearts, we will pay more attention to the similarities in opinions rather than the disagreement. If we want others to be good to us, we need to be good to them. After all, we give love to get love, right? *Loyalty People often forget the meaning and importance of loyalty . Loyalty is necessary for people to believe in each other. In no matter what kind of relationship, we need to believe in each other so that we can work together towards the same goal. *Honesty Honesty is to show other people who we really are. Honesty helps us do better, because it makes us realize our problems and find ways to solve them. It is this honesty, that will make others help you out, not because you need it. But, because they have problems too, which you can help out with. This honesty will help us follow the other values in society and, truly, ""heal the world""!"	['Respect']

What would be the best title for the passage?	Statistics show that every year, about 4 million students fail to pass the national college entrance exam. However, as China recently publicized students' scores for this year's college entrance exam, it seems that schools, parents and society at large give more attention to students who succeed in the exam, few people care about those who fail, the China Education Daily reported. Some students, after failing the exam, cannot get a timely support from their parents or teachers and begin to display some serious mental problems. How to help these students to get rid of the shadow on their mind has become a problem to be taken seriously. First, students' friends, parents and relatives should offer their sympathy and care to them in order to comfort their heart. At this time, parents should not blame students for their failure, otherwise they might bear more psychological burden. Secondly, teachers and the whole society should also offer more support to students who fail the exam. Lastly, students themselves should also try to overcome their depressions and adjust their mood. The newspaper urges the general public to offer their care, trust and support to these students. It also expects that students can face their failure bravely and try to start a new life happily.

When Augustyn found the dog, it was _ .	"A dog found shot in the head and face with a pellet gun, stuffed in a garbage bag and left to die is recovering from his injuries at an animal clinic in Texas. The bag containing the 3-year-old male mixed breed was discovered tied to a fence in Conroe, Texas, earlier this month. When local residents opened the bag, the dog appeared, took a few steps and fell. Augustyn rushed the dog to an emergency animal clinic, where he was treated for many pellets to the face, eyes, mouth, neck and shoulders. The dog was stabilized, but according to Dr Ron Hendrick, a vet at the Animal Emergency Clinic of Conroe, pellets remain in both eyes and it's unclear whether the dog nicknamed Buck was left blind forever. A Facebook page, Buck Needs Bucks for His Buckshot Injuries, was launched last week by Augustyn. It was created to help pay for the dog's medical bills. The page has attracted nearly 7,000 ""likes"" and, according to its creator, already more than enough donations to pay for his treatment. ""The last 24 hours has been overwhelming for me,"" Augustyn wrote on the page. ""I have gone from not knowing if I would have enough money to pay for Buck's emergency bill to having an unbelievable amount of money to provide the best possible care for Buck's recovery. I have thought long and hard about this today and how I should handle this. The conclusion is that I will open a separate bank account for Buck and all donations will be used for Buck's recovery and necessities."" With the help of Facebook, Buck's story quickly sparked international interest. ""Buck is now walking,"" Augustyn says. Police in Montgomery County say they are investigating the incident, and Augustyn says she has been in contact with law enforcement officials about donating a reward for information leading to the arrest of the person who tortured the dog. Sadly, cases like Buck's are not uncommon, particularly in Texas."	['in a horrible physical state']
Which of the following could be used as the last sentence to end the passage?	"The cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is about $ 160,140! That doesn't even touch college tuition. For those with kids, this figure might lead them thinking how much they could have banked. For others, that number might confirmthe decision to remain childless. But $ 160,140 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into $ 8 ,896. 66 a year, $ 741. 38 a month, or $171. 08 a week. That's a mere $24. 44 a day! Just over a dollar an hour.

For $ 160,140, you never have to grow up! You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, and never stop believing in Santa Claus. You have an excuse to keep reading the Adventures of Piglet and Pooh, watching cartoons , going to Disney movies, and wishing on stars. For $ 160,140, you get to be a hero just for taking the training wheels off the bike, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always gets treated to ice cream regardless. You get a front row seat to history; to witness the first step, first word, first date, and first time behind the wheel. You get to be immortal You get another branch added to your family tree. You get an education in nursing, criminal justice and communications that no college can match. In the eyes of a child, you rank right up there with God.

The author named his dog Howard mainly because of _ .	"Maybe you don't think animals have certain mental powers which human beings do not have. But the truth is that some of them have instincts, and besides this, I am sure they can feel certain things we humans cannot. A personal experience showed me this. Some years ago, I had a dog named Howard. From the time when he was a puppy, he was timid, so we named him Howard, sounding like ""coward""! He was especially afraid of thunderstorms. At the first flash of lightning or crash of thunder, he would run whining into his house and hide under a table. I often went for a walk with Howard. Once, as we were walking along a road, it began to rain. I quickly ran to a bus stop for shelter. The bus stop had a roof supported by metal poles. Soon after I had got there, Howard caught my trousers in his teeth and tried to pull me away. At first I was puzzled and a little angry at his behavior. But I decided to humor him and walked away from the shelter into the rain and started to go home. When I was about two hundred metres from the shelter, there came a flash of lightning and soon after, there was thunder which nearly deafened me. Howard stopped walking and began whining. Thinking he was afraid, I bent to pick him up. As I straightened up, I glanced at the bus shelter we had just left. I was shocked to see that two of the poles were bent and the roof was lying on the ground, broken. The shelter had been struck by the bolt of lightning!"	['his timid characteristic']
Which of the following statements is NOT true?	As a new driver with little experience behind the wheel, having to turn into another lane to avoid a careless driver talking on a cellphone is not something that I am prepared for. According to theNew England Journal of Medicine, an accident is four times more likely to happen than normal while you are talking on the phone. Therefore, I hold the view that using a cellphone while driving should be outlawed(......). Cars are two-ton weapons and should be treated as such. When drivers put a key in the engine, they are taking on the responsibility of being a driver. Answer the phone while driving is like taking the safety off a gun -- at any moment something could go wrong and change a life forever. A few countries, including Australia, Great Britain, Spain and Israel, have _ the damage that cellphone use can cause. According to Tom Alex of The Des Moines Register, people who talk on cellphones while driving are just like drunk drivers. They are likely to make a deadly mistake, causing them to hurt themselves or someone else. Some may think that cellphone are helpful when you need directions or are in an emergency situation. Although I agree, I believe the safest way to use your phone is to pull over to the side of the road first. Some may think that hands-free phones are less dangerous, but studies have shown that the danger remains the same with these. Using a cellphone while driving should be outlawed. One small mistake could change your whole life. Please don't let that happen -- stay off your cellphone while driving.	['Using hands-free phone is less likely to cause accidents.']
Which of the following statements would the author agree?	"One of the most difficult questions to answer is how much a job is worth. We naturally expect that a doctor's salary will be higher than a bus conductor's wages. But the question becomes much more difficult to answer when we compare a miner with an engineer, or an unskilled man working on an oil-rig with a teacher in a secondary school. What the doctor, the engineer and the teacher have in common is that they have devoted several years to studying in order to obtain the necessary qualifications for their professions. We feel instinctively that these skills and these years should be rewarded. At the same time we recognize that the work of the miner and the oil-rig laborer is both hard and dangerous, and that they must be highly paid for the risks they take. Another aspect we must take into consideration is how socially useful a man's work is. Most people would agree that looking after the sick or teaching children is more important than, say, selling second-hand cars. Yet it is almost certain that the used-car salesman earns more than the nurse and the schoolteacher. Indeed, this whole question of just rewards can be turned on its head. You can argue that a man who does a job which brings him personal satisfaction is already receiving part of his reward in the form of a so-called ""psychic wage"", and that it is the man with the boring, repetitive job who needs more money to make up for the soul-destroying repetitiveness of his work. It is significant that the jobs like nursing and teaching continue to be poorly paid, while others, such as those in the world of sport or entertainment, carry financial rewards out of all proportion to their social worth. Although the amount of money that people earn is largely determined by market forces, this should not prevent us from seeking some way to decide what is the right pay for the job. A starting point would be to try to decide the ratio which ought to exist between the highest and the lowest paid. The picture is made more complicated by two factors: firstly by the welfare benefits which every citizen receives, and secondly by the taxation system which is often used as an instrument of social justice by taxing high incomes at a very high rate indeed. Most countries now regard a ratio of 7:1 as socially acceptable. If it is less, the highly-qualified people carrying heavy responsibilities will become disappointed, and might even end up by leaving for another country. If it is more, the difference between rich and poor will be so great that it will lead to social unrest."	['People should find a proper ratio between high and low pay.']
Why does the writer say mistakes can be useful?	If You Make a Mistake, Don't Worry! Yeah, you'll want to forget about them, but mistakes can be useful. Making a mistake doesn't mean it's the end of the world. In real life you have to grow and mature, and with that comes some growing pains. You know you should have studied hard but you went out with some friends instead. You know you should have put the money into the bank for a rainy day instead of spending it on all kinds of things you didn't need. It's the growing pains called mistakes that most people make when they are growing up. Face them. You are going to make them. Learn from them. All of the people you wish to copy, such as all the experts in your business field, have made mistakes. They'll continue to make mistakes for all their successes. One of the major differences between people like them and the vast majority of others is that they don't let their mistakes stop them. Instead, they use their mistakes as learning tools. At the very least, when you make a mistake, you'll know what not to do. And you can help others by warning them of the mistakes you've made. Don't let mistakes stop you from doing anything. Learn from them, don't hide in a closet. Facing up to your mistakes now and later will mature. What mistakes are you making right now? Take a look at anything you might be doing wrong. Take a step back and evaluate your situation, then fix whatever needs to be corrected. Then move forward. Always remember your mistakes to remind yourself of what not to do for the future.

All that is required is a bit of imagination and some time set aside for fun. And the best part is that these are the kind of memories a child will remember for a lifetime. Family game night Find out any of the games that are already around the house. Kids often get computer games for Christmas or birthdays, and would love to have a chance to play with their family. Or, make up some games of your own. "" _ "" is a fun game to play that will challenge a child to use his/her imagination. Divide the family into teams and let each team come up with words that the other has to act out. _ Pick some time for the family to sit down and come up with their own masterpiece. It doesn't need to be just a drawing -- take some old magazines sitting around the house, let the kids cut out pictures and paste them into their own montage. Or, use items from nature. Let them use leaves, pine cones, twigs and whatever else they can find to create something from their imaginations. Family Picnic Taking the family for a picnic is a great way for some fun that doesn't cost any money. If the weather is nice, take them to a park or playground and let the kids have a day of playing. Or, if it is the middle of winter and a foot of snow is on the ground, set up a picnic in the living room. Family Field Trip A family field trip doesn't have to cost a dime. Ask a nearby farm if it would be alright to bring your kids out for a tour and to see some of the animals. Or take them to a park and make a scavenger hunt where they need to find certain items from nature. Ask a local business if you could bring the family for a tour to see how things work -- you might be surprised at the number of people who would be thrilled to share what they do with others, and it could be an interesting lesson for the kids."

What is the best title for the passage?	"Sir Nicholas Winton, rescuer of children, died on July 1st,2015,aged 106. When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure. When faced with a problem, his instinct was to solve it. So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases. He avoided that by treating them like a commercial transaction: like the world he knew, in fact. A market was created, takers were sought and any likely bidder would do. Siblings were separated, if necessary. Jewish children they were almost all Jewish were often placed with Gentile families. Mr Winton did not care and he just had to get the children out alive and fast. When they arrived, exhausted, at Liverpool Street he seldom greeted them himself, preferring to stay calmly at a distance. Only one event traumatised him: the disappearance of 250 children on the last transport of September 1st 1939,as war was declared. But this awful thing too he stored at the back of his mind, realising that he had done all he could and his part was over. The scrapbook of lists, photographs and begging letters went up to the attic; he said nothing about it, and moved on. He liked it that way. The silent background suited him very well. For 50 years he sat on the Czech story, not supposing anyone would want to know, until in 1988 the scrapbook came to light and, with it, a blaze of publicity, culminating in an evening on Esther Rantzen's ""That's Life"" TV show when the whole audience suddenly stood up round him, applauding him,and every one was a child he had saved. It was "" ly awftil"",he thought; and wept with long-suppressed joy. He was still no hero, though, in his own book. He had had no desire to improve the world: indeed, not even much idea which job he was best suited for. At his father's suggestion he had tried banking first, having left Stowe with nothing much to show for it. After the war he dabbled in business,but it didn't take. In later years he worked for a mental-health charity and helped to set up homes for the elderly; and wondered why saving the Czech children was deemed more heroic than those things. He had simply done what needed doing at that time, in that place. Surely any decent person would have done the same?"	['A job well done']

When Carlo came to the bad part of the road, he _ .	"Here is a dog with a lantern in his mouth, he is looking for his master . Carlo, a lovely dog, had been taught to be useful. The roads, in the place where his master lived, were often so bad that it was not safe for any person to go out without a light on dark nights. So Carlo's master taught him to carry a lantern for him at night; and he did it as steadily as any boy could have done. Carlo never trotted too far before his master so that the bright light of the lantern might guide his master's steps. When he came to a deep rut or hole in the road, he would turn round to his master, seemed to say, /Take care, there is a hole here. "" The dog's master lived about a mile from the town; and when he could not get home before dark, Carlo used to be sent to him with the lantern. Carlo knew where to go. He also knew the road which his master would take. But Carlo didn't always find his master right away. When he reached the town, he would run off to a house where his master often was. Still holding his lantern, he would scratch at the street-door with his feet and bark ; as much as to say, 6/Here am I, Master, with the lantern, are you ready for home? "" Someone would perhaps come to the door and sa 6/Your master is not here. "" Carlo would growl , seemed to say, ""Then he is somewhere else, and I must find him. "" He would then run off to one house after another, until he found his master, then the two went home together."	['turned round to his master']
What did Larry expect his daughter to do?	Larry was on another of his underwater expeditions but this time, it was different. He decided to take his daughter along with him. She was only ten years old. This would be her first trip with her father on what he had always been famous for. Larry first began diving when he was his daughter's age. Similarly, his father had taken him along on one of his expeditions. Since then, he had never looked back. Larry started out by renting diving suits from the small diving shop just along the shore. He had hated them. They were either too big or too small. Then, there was the instructor. He gave him a short lesson before allowing him into the water with his father. He had made an exception. Larry would never have been able to go down without at least five hours of theory and another similar number of hours on practical lessons with a guide. Children his age were not even allowed to dive. After the first expedition, Larry's later diving adventures only got better and better. There was never a dull moment. In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank fastened on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures. Larry's first expedition without his father was in the Cayman Islands. There were numerous diving spots in the area and Larry was determined to visit all of them. Fortunately for him, a man offered to take him around the different Spots for free. _ The diving spots afforded such a wide array of fish and sea creatures that Larry saw more than thirty varieties of creatures. Larry looked at his daughter. She looked as excited as he had been when he was her age. He hoped she would be able to continue the family tradition. Already, she looked like she was much braver than had been then. This was the key to a successful underwater expedition.	['Become a successful diver.']
What is the structure of the passage?	Sharing not only exists between humanbeings.As is often seen that some plants and anima1s live close together, and they depend on each other. They are usually very different from their partner, and yet all live easier lives because of each other. It is nature's idea of sharing. An example of a partnership is the shark and pilot fish. The pilot fish is a little fish only about nine inches long. He would be. helpless if he hung around by himself in the mighty ocean. He makes up for his size with his smartness. He cleverly swims along beside the shark. When the shark eats, the pilot fish gets the leftovers. And the pilot fish needn't worry about his safety. The shark also gets benefits from this relationship. The pilot fish cleans food scraps and insects from the shark's hide. Another example of depending on each other is the sea anemone and striped clown fish. The sea anemone looks like a flower and has petals that contain poisonous stinging cells. When small fish swim into the petals, the anemone traps and paralyzes them. However,the striped clown fish is able to swim into the poisonous petals without being harmed. When he is in danger, he quickly swims into the sea anemone and is unable to be seen by his enemies. To pay for his safety,the clown fish brings food to the anemone. He also guides other fish into the anemone's deadly trap. Large mammals such as the ox, antelope, rhinoceroses and African buffalo form such a relationship with the red-billed ox-peeker. They provide daily meals for the bird. In fact the bird eats insects. The various large mammals act as a restaurant with a varied menu for the ox-peeker. What do they get in return from the bird? Free beauty treatments! Some plants live together in a beneficial relationship of symbiosis. The fungus does not have chlorophyll that plants need to make food. However, green algae does contain chlorophyll. It is, therefore, able to feed the fungus along with itself. But nothing is free! The fungus repays it by protecting the algae. Since it takes in and stores water, it can provide the algae with a non-ending water supply.	['1-2345']
When did the Tangshan Earthquake take place?	"The light is swaying .The building is shaking. A woman with a baby in her arms is trying to open the door, but fails. Finding no way, she rushes into her bedroom and there they _ the earthquake. In a factory building, as the workshop floor swings under the terrible shaking, workers run for safety. Some hide under the machines and survive, but others who try to run outside are killed by the falling ceilings.

By studying actual cases in the earthquake areas and scientific experiments, experts found that building remain untouched for the first 12 seconds of an earthquake. In this short time, one has the best chance of surviving an earthquake by staying near the inside walls, in bedrooms and under beds, experts concluded in the film. ""Earthquake seems to catch the lives of those who run,""said many survivors in the earthquake areas, describing how their friends were killed on the doorways or along the stair steps as they tried to get out of the building. Their advice was proved in the film,""Take a hiding-place where you are rather than run, unless you are sure you can reach a safe open place in ten seconds."""	['July 28, 1976.']
What would be the best title for the text?	Key West, Florida is a wonderful place to spend a vacation. It is a truly charming and fun city for the whole family. And of course you will get the good weather of Florida, with which you have plenty of time to enjoy the outdoor activities. Key West is the most southern city in the continental USA.

There are so many public transportation--taxis, tour trains, trolleys, bikes--and you can even walk if you choose. There are beautiful coral reefs. The deep reefs are farther off shore and are best visited with an experienced guide. However, there are shallow reefs close in where snorkelers can explore to their heart's content. At Key West Marine Park you can do some good snorkeling. In Key West you can go diving, fishing and do all sorts of water sports. The problem with Key West is that no one ever wants to leave.

Why did the man hit Jamie Beondik with the chain?	"When Jamie Beondik saw a puppy getting beaten with a chain, he tried to help. What he got in return was a beating of his own and he had to go to hospital. The neighbors saw the fourmonthold black dog named Tomba Wednesday morning being beaten, choked and dragged on a chain by a man on a bike. Jamie decided to get involved, telling the man to stop hurting Tomba. ""He started swinging the chain around in the air and I said 'OK. Well, I'm going to call the police.' And that's when he hit me with the chain,"" said Jamie. He got hit in the legs and then the man and the dog ran off.

What's the best title for the passage?	An American called Simon goes to London to see his friend, Rick. Rick tells him that his flat is on the first floor. When he gets there, Simon goes straight to the first floor of the building. But people there tells him that there is no Rick on that floor. Do you know why? In fact, English people call the first floor of a building the ground floor. The floor above the ground floor is the first floor, but Americans call it the second floor. The story shows that there are a few culture differences between English and America, though they both speak English. English people usually hide their feelings. They seldom start a dialogue with strangers . For example, on the train they often spend their time reading newspapers or books. But Americans are quite different. They're more active and easier to talk with. English people and Americans use different _ for many things. English people usually use football, eraser and mail, but Americans use soccer, rubber and post.	['Differences in culture']

The tenants did not like _ .	"About three hundred words in the English language come from the names of people. Many of these words are technical words. When there is a new invention of discovery, a new word may be coined after the inventor or scientist. It is interesting to observe how many common words have found their way into the language from the names of people. Lord Sandwich, who lived from 1718-1792, used to sit at the gambling table eating bread with meat in between. As the Lord was the only one among his friends who ate bread in that way, his friends began to call the bread ""sandwich"" for fun. Later on,the word became part of the English language. The word ""boycott"" means to refuse to have anything to do with somebody or something. It comes from a man called Captain Boycott. He was a land agent in 1880 and he collected rents and taxes for an English landowner in Ireland. But the Captain was a very harsh man. He treated his poor tenants very badly. His tenants decided not to speak to him at all. Eventually word got back to the landowner and the Captain was removed . The word ""boycott"" became popular and was used by everyone to mean the kind of treatment that was received by Captain Boycott."	['the harsh land agent']
Which can be the best title for the passage?	"San Francisco(People's Daily Online)-- Apple Inc. Tuesday introduced its mobile payment service Apple Pay alongside the company's iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California. What apple does is to replace consumers' wallet with its cell phone. Apple said it hopes to speed up the checkout process, make credit-card payments more secure and ultimately, to replace physical wallets. With the near-field communication technology, Apple's gadgets like iPhone and Apple watch can transmit a radio signal between the device and a receiver when the two are in an inch apart. ""To pay, just hold your iPhone near the contactless reader with your finger on Touch ID. You don't even have to look at the screen to know your payment information was successfully sent,"" Apple says on its official website. Apple said that each transaction would be authorized with a one-time, unique number, creating a security code that it said is more secure than the one on the back of your credit card because cashiers won't see your name, card number or security code. The service will work with the three major payment networks -- American Express, MasterCard and Visa -- and Apple said that there are 220,000 merchant locations that accept these contactless payments. When some applaud this disrupted service that will compete with Paypal and endanger other online payment companies, some others concern about its safety, especially when another retailer Home Depot confirmed a data opening yesterday and iCloud was reported exposing nude pictures of celebrities a week ago. Leo Zheng, a technology reporter in Silicon Valley said: ""When Apple attracts consumers to put all their cards into one iPhone and promised the security, Jennifer Lawrence should say something."""

What did Selena think of Disney days which were behind her?	"Selena Gomez and I are scheduled to meet at a lowkey coffee shop in Encino.

Not even a drop of makeup. She was ten minutes early and no one else in the restaurant looked up so much. Selena was wearing Bebe shorts. She had a baby face and ordered a hot chocolate. After making small talk about what she wore for the shoot, she dived into the subject of her career. Selena declared 2012 the year of movies. She filmed three: Spring Breakers, a drama; The Getaway, an action flick; and Hotel Transylvania, a comedy. Each is a marked move away from the teen style that made her a household name.

What would be the best title for the passage?	"Language has a powerful influence over people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance. The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle way. It is important to understand the connotation of a word. ""Armchair"",for example,suggests comfort,whereas ""chair"" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways. Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language. The language of advertising always emphasizes why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent may say ""It gets clothes whiter"",but whiter than what?"	['Language in Advertising']
If a person lives from hand to mouth, it implies _ .	"People use their mouths for many things.They eat, talk, shout and sing. They smile and they kiss. In English language ,there are many expressions using the word ""mouth"".Foe example, If you say bad things about a person, the person might protest and say "" Don't bad mouth me."" Sometimes ,people say something to a friend or family member that they later regret because it hurts that person's feelings.Or they tell the person something they were not supposed to tell. The speaker might say: ""I really put my foot in my mouth this time."" If this should happen, the speaker might feel down in the mouth. In other words , he might fell sad for saying the wrong thing. Another situation is when someone falsely claims another person said something.The other person might protest: ""I did not say that .Non't put words in my mouth."" Some people have lots of money because they were born into a very rich family. There is an expression for this, too. Ypu might say such a person, "" was born with a silver spoon in his mouth."" This rich person is the opposite who lives from hand to mouth. This person is verry poor and only has enough money for the most important things in life ,like food. Parents might sometimes withold sweet food from a child as a form of punishment for saying bad things.For example,if a child says things she should not say to her parents, she might be described as a mouthy child.The parents might even tell the child to ""stop mouthing off.""

What happened to the writer at the beginning of the story?	"My life suffered a lot in summer five years ago. My father died in a car accident,leaving my mother,my two younger brothers and I alone. At that time,I was a senior high school student. After my father's funeral,I had no choice but to drop out of school and work in a factory. I really wanted to return to school and wanted to go to college,but I couldn't. I only hoped to bring up my two young brothers. Life was not easy for me,for I can't afford their tuition even if I worked from day to night without stopping. Without my father's protection,I thought I was a slave to the fate. Later on,something changed my life. I still remember that it was a rainy day. I put myself in the rain and walked slowly in the street. Suddenly the rain stopped!I raised my head and found ""the sky"" was in fact a dark blue umbrella. Then I noticed a middleaged man with one leg on crutch standing behind me. He said to me,""Why not run without an umbrella?If you didn't run,you would get drenched."" The man told me that he was a promoter. He once dreamed of being a policeman,but an accident ruined his dream. Though his present job was not suitable for his legs,it was a wonderful start to him. He was very happy that he didn't lose heart and still ""ran"" on the road of life... I was encouraged by the man's words. I went to a big city and became an assurance representative. After two years' running,I did well and my family condition turned better little by little. Later I returned to school and succeeded in my entrance to university. Life is like this. When you are in rainy days in your life,if you couldn't find a way to prevent you from being wet,you would be overwhelmed. But if you decide to get rid of it,you'll discover that the rainy days last not so long as you imagine."	"[""He couldn't afford his two brothers' tuition even if he worked from day to night.""]"

Many parents think that teachers should _ .	"After students come home from a tiring day at school, they tend to worry a lot about their homework. Whether students are working on English or chemistry homework, they are simply working on the assignment in order to get it done, attempting to memorize the concepts for the time being and do not absorb any of the information afterward. Students are wasting their time on insignificant assignments rather than effectively using that time to achieve other accomplishments. According to www.dailymail.com, many parents are concerned that homework is being assigned rather than being used to integrate what teachers are covering in the classroom. In their eyes, if less homework is assigned, students would have much less stress and could focus more on their passions and hobbies. Homework gets in the way of participating in community service events as well as opportunities for getting a job or being a part of an extra-curricular activity. These responsibilities are important for teenagers to take on because they prepare the teenagers for the ""real world."" Without the proper exposure to work that is not school related, students will find themselves lost after they graduate. If homework were no longer given, students would have a lot more time to mature in other fields rather than being educated only on academics. In spite of the fact that teachers want students to do better on tests and absorb the material that they are teaching, homework is not accomplishing its purpose. Because school is becoming increasingly more competitive and challenging, homework is becoming a setback rather than extra practice. Its removal would benefit the well being of teenagers as well as encourage them to get out in the ""real world"" and discover themselves instead of staring at a pile of assignments."	"[""reduce homework to develop students' own interests""]"

And it may not be that their parents have failed to enforce bedtime. Instead, it may be that biologically these sleepyhead students aren't used to the early hour. ""Maybe these kids are being asked to rise at the wrong time for their bodies,"" says Mary Carskadon, a professor looking at problem of adolescent sleep at Brown's School of Medicine. Carskadon is trying to understand more about the effects of early school time in adolescents. And, at a more basic level. she and her team are trying to learn more about how the biological changes of adolescence affect sleep needs and patterns. Carskadon says her work suggests that adolescents may need more sleep than they did at childhood, no less, as commonly thought. Sleep patterns change during adolescence, as any parent of an adolescent can prove. Most adolescents prefer to stay up later at nigh and sleep later in the morning. But it's not just a matter of choice -their bodies are going through a change of sleep patterns. All of this makes the transfer from middle school to high school--which may start one hour earlier in the morning ---- all the more difficult , Carskadon says. With their increased need for sleep and their biological clocks set on the ""sleep late, rise late"" pattern, adolescent are up against difficulties when it comes to trying to be up by 5 or 6 a.m. for a 7:30 a.m. first bell. A short sleep on a desktop may be their body's way of saying. ""I need a timeout."""	['Adolescents sleep better than they did at childhood.']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	"At Dulles High school in Sugar Land, Texas, the roster for Advanced Chinese begins with Jason Chao and ends with Kathy Zhang. In between comes an unexpected name: Elizabeth Hoffman. Hoffman, now a 12thgrader, began learning Chinese in the eighth grade, has spent a summer studying in Nanjing and plans to perfect her Mandarin next fall. When asked by her peers---why she is learning Chinese, she responds with a question: ""why aren't you?"" As China rushes toward superpower status, America's schools and government officials are responding to Hoffman's opinion. Earlier this year Eush Holt of New Jersey introduced legialation calling for increased money of programs for less commonly taught languages, ""For reasons of economics, culture and security, we should have much better facilities with Chinese languages and dialects,"" he said. The State Department has pointed out Chinese is becoming a ""critical language"", but the most recent data show that only 24,000 students in Grade 7 to Grade 12 study Chinese. Still, the number is growing. In Chicago public schools, enrollment in Chinese classes has skyrocked from 5000 students in 2005 to nearly 35,000 students this year. In the Santa Clara County, California, enrollment has quadrupled during the same period. In 2007, when the College Board first introduces advanced-placement language exams in Chinese and Italian, 2,400 high school plan to offer AP Chinese---10 times the number of students that plan to offer AP Italian. Much of the interest can be explained by China's increasing competiviveness. ""People are always trying to judge what languages are going to be useful for the future,"" says Marty Abbot, the director of education at the National Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, Stephanie Wong, a student At Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, California, chose Chinese so that she could speak with her grandfather. Wong also predicted that Chinese will be important if she becomes a doctor. 80 percent of people in her hometown are Asians."

What does the writer regard as the official date of the beginning of photography?	Today, I'm going to talk about the invention of the camera and photography. The camera is often thought to be a modern invention. But as early as 1727, a German physicist discovered that light darkened silver salt, a chemical compound. Using as a camera, a big box with a small hole to let the light in, he made temporary images on the salt. Silver salt is still the base of film today. Then a French scientist made the first permanent picture by using a special piece of metal sensitized(...)with silver salt. A photograph he made in 1826 still exists. The painter Daguerre improved on the process by placing common salt, the kind we eat, on the metal. This was in 1839, the official date of the beginning of photography. But the problem was the printing of the photographs. And it was not until other scientists developed the kind of paper we now use that good printing was possible and photography became truly common. In the 1860s, Mathew Brady was able to take his famous pictures of the American Civil War, thus making portrait poses very popular. In the 20thcentury, George Eastmen of theprefix = st1 /United Statessimplified film-developing film, and Dr. Edwin Land invented the so-called instant camera with self-developing film. If we say that the photography came into existence in 1839, it follows that it has taken more than one hundred years for the camera to reach the present condition of technical refinement .

What might be the most suitable title for the text?	"An annoying problem for humans, who like to boast about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we've never taken a good look right under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle . Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack . Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. ""We're going somewhere we haven't been before,""he says. ""In all possibility, there will be surprises."" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seems like impossible ideas."	['To the Center of the Earth']
How much should Nicky Haywood pay according to the court?	"Nicky Haywood, from Nottingham, was found guilty of travelling on an East Midlands train from Nottingham to Newstead without a ticket. The 27-year-old, who did not appear for his hearing at Nottingham Magistrates Court , is now being made to pay the price --- which is almost 200 times the original price ---- for the 20 minute journey. According to the Nottingham Post, Magistrates have ordered Haywood to pay a $ 220 fine, $ 302 in costs, a $ 22 government surcharge and the $ 2.80 fare. Senior conductor, Yvonne Clay was working on the day of the incident, according to the Nottingham Post. The newspaper reported that she said Haywood had got on the train without a ticket, though he had the chance to buy one from both vending machines and booking offices on the platform. She said:""He offered a Solo Electron card but we could not take that on the train. I informed him with a notice to pay. He gave his name and address and had 21 days to pay the fare."" Even though he was given three weeks to pay the $ 2.80, a payment from Haywood was not received."	['$546.8.']

From the article we understand _ .	"New York City consists of five parts: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. The population is about 7.5 million and there are 1.5 million in Manhattan alone. Manhattan, the center of the city, is on the island between the Hudson River and the East River. Most of the famous buildings such as the Empire State and the United Nations and other skyscrapers are in Manhattan. Some of its districts are: Broadway, which has many theatres and cinemas, Fifth Avenue, with stores and apartments, Greenwich Village, where many artists and writers have lived, and Central Park, with a skating rink . From Manhattan you have to cross to the other parts of New York City through a tunnel or over a bridge. The bridge from Brooklyn to Staten Island is the longest in the world. New York is the second biggest port in the world and it has two airports. The people who live there come from all over the world and speak many different languages. There are 324,000 Germans and 390,000 Poles as well as people from Greece, Scotland, Ireland, Italy and Romania. People call one district ""Little Italy"" and another ""China town""."

The seed variety is shown on the cup mainly to _ .	Unless you bring your own thermos, paper cups are the real option for on-the-go coffee. But as we all know, producing these simple items cuts down forests of trees and contributes to mountains of waste. In fact, Starbucks alone uses 4 billion paper cups a year globally and most of these plastic-lined cups are never recycled. But a project from Reduce. Reuse. Grow. is handling the coffee industry's paper cup problem by giving these single-use coffee holders a further purpose: reforestation. A company in California has developed the world's first plantable coffee cup, which has seeds in the paper-based material. That means after you're done with the cup, you can tear it, leave it in water for a few minutes, bury it and let nature take over. To prevent the spread of invasive plants, the bottom of the cup details the seed variety and also includes instructions on how to plant it either in the northern or central coast of California. For those who don't want to get their hands dirty, the cup can be put into a Reduce. Reuse. Grow bin where it will eventually be taken to a reforestation location. The cup can biodegrade within 180 days and offer nutrition to plants. The company is trying to put the cup into commercial production and persuade coffee shops to buy the cups.

The passage is written mainly to _ .	"Step into Pat Lundin's home and you'll be greeted by 500 smiling faces of dolls. Lundin, 82, describes herself as ""doll crazy"". And she's not alone. As a member of Timeless Treasures Doll Club of Largo, she frequently meets with 25 other women who share her hobby. Once a month, they gather at the Palms of Largo to show off their latest finds and catch up on news in the world of doll collecting. On Saturday, the club will hold the Palms of Largo Fifth Annual Doll Show. The program will include 37 vendors with both classic and contemporary dolls for sale. ""Timeless Treasures is a club that's open to doll lovers regardless of the age of the doll,"" said Judy Smith, president of the organization. ""Some doll clubs require members have a certain number of antique dolls, but we don't. we make sure we are not terribly formal."" Smith, 71, is a retired schoolteacher who owns Judy's Doll Hospital, a part-time business she operates out of her home. She will have a table offering repair and appraisal services. Smith firs began studying and collecting dolls in her early 20s,in Glassboro, New Jersey, she does not know how many dolls she owns, or how many repairs she has made over the years. But she does know the age of her oldest doll. ""She's 129,"" Smith said. ""It is a German-made doll that belonged to my grandmother , and it sits in my living room."" The show is for both the beginner as well as the experienced collector, said Anita Munson, one of the show's organizers. Over the years, Munson, 82, has learned how to identify a valuable doll. ""Generally speaking porcelain dolls are the most valuable,"" she said. ""But the porcelain will not be shiny."" Smith believes many people will attend to find out how much their dolls are worth. She wants them to know more. ""Because the dolls reflect what the children were wearing and doing at a particular period of time, they can be a great history lesson for children now,"" she said."

What does h. a. b. e's stand for?	"Successful people have developed habits leading to success. Those are the people you want to study and follow. Do what they do. Read what they read. If they are local, see if you can take them to lunch and ask questions. If not, get a hold of some of the things they have written about or listen to them. Most successful people enjoy the opportunity to coach people along and to help them become successful. It is their way of giving back. The trouble is that most people won't ask. They come up with excuses. They say to themselves, "" I am not important enough for this person to talk to me."" The successful people understand that life is a learning experience and it doesn't stop in school. They always strive( ,) to reach the next level. Life will always give you the results of your actions. Ask yourself what actions are you taking? What are you creating? You create what you think about. Willie Hooks calls it our h. a. b. e.'s.

So there it is in a nutshell. We have the power to change any bad habit that we don't like. Will it be easy? Probably not, but it might not be as hard as we think either.

How do love shoppers meet one another?	"Although Paris is often considered the city of romance, close to a million adults who call it home are single. Many single people say that France's capital is one of the most difficult places to meet people. The complaints of this lonely group have inspired a new phenomenon known as ""supermarket dating."" At Galerie Lafayette Gourmet,singles can shop for more than just the items on their grocery list. They can look for someone who has blue eyes, brown hair,and is 1.8 meters tall,or whatever may be on their romantic shopping list. At this Paris location,single people of all ages can schedule their shopping for Thursday nights between 6:30 and 9:00 p.m. When they walk through the door,they pick up a purple basket to advise that they are looking for love. They try to arrive early because the baskets disappear quickly, and then they have to wait in line for their turn to wander the store aisles . With purple baskets in hand, shoppers can consider their romantic options while they pick out their groceries. When they are ready to pay, they can go to the checkout line for singles who want to chat. Most of the people who look for love in the supermarket are skeptical of Internet dating. They know that it is easy to embellish one's appearance or to lie about one's age over the Internet. The supermarket, on the other hand,is considered a safe and casual environment in which to meet a potential match. In addition, what one finds in another's grocery basket can say a thing or two about that person's character or intentions. Buying pet food can be a man's way of showing a potential match that he has a sensitive side. Women who fill their baskets with low-fat food show their healthy style of living. These ways it's possible to find much more than food at a grocery store."	['They go through a special checkout.']
Which of the following statements about Guggenheim Museum is true?

The writer lived in_years ago.	"Years ago, I lived in a building in a town. There was another building across form mine, and it was only a few meters away. There lived a woman whom I had never met. I could see her sit by the window each afternoon, drinking or reading. Several months later, I noticed her window was very dirty. Everything was not clear through the window. I wondered why the woman didn't wash her window. One sunny morning, I decided to clean up my apartment, including washing my windows. Late in the afternoon when I finished the cleaning, I sat down for a rest by the window. What a surprise! The woman sitting by her window was clearly seen! Her window was clean! Suddenly, I realized I had made a mistake. I was watching her through my dirty window all the time! That was quite an important lesson for me. Since then, whenever I wanted to judge someone, I asked myself first, "" Am I looking at him through the dirty window of my heart?"" Then I try to clean the window of my own world so that I may see the world clearly."	['a town']

People usually think that _ .	"Is the 'Go to College' Message Overdone? Even in a weak job market, the old college try isn't the answer for everyone. A briefing paper from the Brookings Institution warns that ""we may have overdone the message"" on college, senior fellow Isabel Sawhill said. ""We've been telling students and their families for years that college is the only way to succeed in the economy and of course there's a lot of truth to that,"" Ms. Sawhill said. ""On average it does pay off... But if you load up on a whole lot of student debt and then you don't graduate, that is a very bad situation."" One comment that people often repeat among the years of slow job growth has been the value of education for landing a job and advancing in a career. April's national unemployment rate stood at 7.5%, according to the Labor Department. The unemployment rate for high-school graduates over 25 years old who hadn't attended college was 7.4%, compared with 3.9% for those with a bachelor's degree or more education. The difference is even bigger among those aged 16-24. The jobless rate for those with only a high school diploma in that age group is about 20%. At the same time, recent research by Canadian economists cautions that a college degree is no guarantee of promising employment. Ms. Sawhill pointed out that among the aspects that affect the value of a college education is the field of one's major: Students in engineering or other sciences end up earning more than ones who major in the arts or education. The cost of tuition and the availability of financial aid are other considerations, with public institutions generally a better financial bargain than private ones. She suggested two avenues for improving the situation: increasing vocational -technical training programs and _ Europe's focus on early education rather than post-secondary learning. ""The European countries put a little more attention to getting people prepared in the primary grades,"" she said. ""Then they have a higher bar for whoever goes to college--but once you get into college, you're more likely to be highly subsidized ."" She also is a supporter of technical training--to teach students how to be plumbers, welders and computer programmers--because ""employers are desperate"" for workers with these skills."

Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?	"Americans who volunteer for the Peace Corps get a chance to help improve lives in developing countries. They also get a chance to learn more about the world, and about themselves. This week this program is celebrating its 50th anniversary . President John Kennedy set up the Peace Corps soon after he took office in 1961. It was the time of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union . The new program gave Americans a chance to answer the call to service that the president made in his inaugural speech. ""Ask not what your country can do for you,"" he said. ""Ask what you can do for your country."" Kennedy told Peace Corps volunteers that America's image in the countries where they were going would depend largely on them. On August 30th, 1961, the first group of 51 Peace Corps volunteers arrived in Accra, Ghana, to serve as teachers. They had agreed to work for almost no pay. They would spend two years in Ghana helping its people and learning the reality of life in a developing country. Most of the volunteers had just completed college. About half of them taught English or health care. In the 50 years since then, more than 200,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps volunteers. They have worked in 139 countries. The Peace Corps is a government agency that was created to promote world peace and friendship. There are three goals: First, to help the people of interested countries in meeting their need for trained men and women. Second, to help promote a better understanding of Americans on the part of the people served. And, third, to help promote a better understanding of other people on the part of Americans. Today, the Peace Corps has more than 8,000 volunteers and trainees in 77 countries. They work in agriculture, economic development, education, the environment and health care. Some work in programs related to youth development. Fifty percent of current Peace Corps volunteers are women. The average age of a volunteer is 28. But the ages of Peace Corps volunteers range from 18 to 86. Some Americans join the Peace Corps after they retire . Today seven percent of volunteers are over the age of 50. And 19 percent are members of minority groups."	['Most of the volunteers had just graduated from college.']

The girl wanted to borrow a pen, because _ .	I found out one time that doing a favor for someone could get you into a lot of trouble. I was in the eighth grade at the time, and we were having a final test. During the test, the girl sitting next to me whispered something, but I didn't understand. So I leaned over her way and found out that she was trying to ask me if I had an extra pen. She showed me that hers was out of ink and would not write. I happened to have an extra one, so I took it out of my pocket and put it on her desk. Later, after the test papers had been turned in, the teacher asked me to stay in the room when all the other students were dismissed . As soon as we were alone she began to talk to me about what it meant to grow up; she talked about how important it was to stand on your own two feet and be responsible for your own acts. For a long time, she talked about honesty and emphasized the fact that when people do something dishonest, they are really cheating themselves. She made me promise that I would think seriously about all the things she had said, and then she told me I could leave. I walked out of the room wondering why she had chosen to talk to me about all those things. Later on, I found out that she thought I had cheated on the test. When she saw me lean over to talk to the girl next to me, it looked as if I was copying answers from the girl's test paper. I tried to explain about the pen, but all she could say was it seemed very very strange to her that I hadn't talked of anything about the pen the day she talked to me right after the test. Even if I tried to explain that I was just doing the girl a favor by letting her use my pen, I am sure she continued to believe that I had cheated on the test.

Why did the farmer bring apples to the rich man? Because	"Once there was a poor farmer and his farm belonged to a rich man. One day he brought a basket of apples to the rich man's house.

From the story we know _ .	"There once was a man and a woman. They had been married for more than 60 years.

People in multicultural countries such as the US or Canada lay more stress on _ .	United States and Canada are multicultural countries with many national, religious and cultural differences, where people attach great importance to individualism--the uniqueness among people. Teachers value the qualities that make each student special and different. You can see such values through their educational systems. For example, students needn't memorize lots of information. Instead, they work independently and find answers on their own. There are discussions for children to show their own ideas and opinions. By contrast, people have the same language, history, and culture in most Asian societies. As a result, Asia's educational system reflects society's belief in group goals and purposes rather than individualism. Children in China, Japan, and Korea learn to work together and help one another in assignments. And the teaching methods are often very formal and serious. In class, teachers give lectures while students listen and take notes. Discussion is replaced by reciting rules of information that have been memorized. These two systems both have advantages and disadvantages. One advantage in Japan is that there is much more math and science than American students learn by the end of high school. In addition, students study more hours each day and more days each year than North Americans do. The difficult system also prepares students for a society that place emphasis on discipline and self-control. However, while memorization is an important learning method in Japanese schools, yet many students admit forgetting much of the information that they have memorized after exams. On the other hand, the educational system in North American has an advantage that students learn to think for themselves, which prepares them for a society that values creativity. The disadvantage is that when they graduate from high school, they haven't recited as many basic rules and facts as students in other countries have.	['individualism']
The articles published on Converge Magazine are about _ .	What do you think about mistakes? Maybe you say no one likes making mistakes. But mistakes lead to growth. Converge Magazine recently published articles about mistakes students should make. It suggests students need to live a balanced life, even in the college environment. According to the topic of the article, there are four mistakes students should make. The mistakes include: Think they pick the wrong major A student should explore any possibility that interests him, and future careers might just be around the corner. Remember, if you don't know what to do, it's OK! Think their teachers know everything Students may think of their teachers as gods who know everything, but that really is not the case. Students should know teachers are the ones who can help us understand better. Students can research answers on their own and get their own opinions instead of having their teachers tell them the answers. Think they get too involved Getting good grades is very important, but it's only a part of the life. Joining clubs and learning about social situations are all good for teenagers' growth. It will not only make the students more knowledgeable but also create interest in their education. Think taking a day off is a waste of time Now, students are under too much pressure. It's necessary for them to relax now and then. But they always keep in mind how that might influence their schoolwork. Take a day off to relax, and you may get an energetic student the next day. Just don't do it too often.	"[""students' mistakes""]"

Which of the following is true?	We know good manners are important. Today I am going to tell you something about manners in different countries. I think you already know that people in different countries usually have different ways of doing things. Something that is rude in one country may be quite polite in another. For example, in Britain you mustn't lift your bowl to your mouth when you are having liquid food. That is considered bad manners in Britain. But in Japan you needn't worry about making a noise when you drink something. It shows that you are enjoying it. In Britain we try not to put our hands on the table at all during a meal. In Mexico, however, guests are expected to keep their hands on the table _ a meal. In Arabic countries we must be careful with our hands. You see, in Arabic countries you mustn't eat with your left hand. This is considered to be very impolite. So, what should you do if you visit a foreign country? Well, you needn't worry. You can ask the native people there to help you and you can just watch carefully and try to do what they do.	['Different manners in different countries.']

What should you do when you are taking the examination?	A good way to pass an examination is to work hard every day in the year. You may fail in the examination if you are lazy for most of the year and then work hard only a few days before the examination. If you are taking an English examination, don't learn only rules of grammar. Try to read stories in English and speak in English whenever you can.

The young people just graduated from school may not behave well in the working world because _ .	When young people get their first real jobs, they face a lot of new, confusing situations. They may find that everything is different from the way things were at school. It is also possible that they will feel uncomfortable and insecure in both professional and social situations. Eventually , they realize that university classes can't be the only preparation for all of the different situations that arise in the working world. Perhaps the best way to learn how to behave in the working world is to identify a worker you admire and observe his behavior. In doing so, you will be able to see what it is that you admire in this person. For example, you'll observe how he acts in a crisis. Perhaps even more important, you'll be able see what is his approach to day-to-day situations. While you are observing your colleague, you should be asking yourself whether his behavior is like yours and how you can learn from his responses to a variety of situations. By watching and learning from a model, you'll probably begin to identify and adopt good working habits.	['what they learn in university classes is not adequate for their new life']

According to Obama, he plays golf to _ .	"President Barack Obama has complained about the loss of privacy that comes with being leader of the United States, regretting the loss of simple pleasures such as a long walk or a trip to the car wash or supermarket. ""I just miss - I miss being unknown,"" he said. ""I miss Saturday morning, rolling out of bed, not shaving, getting into my car with my girls, driving to the supermarket, squeezing the fruit, getting my car washed, taking walks.

The author wasn't enlisted into the army because _ .	I was born in Brooklyn. My father was a small-business man and we never had much money. He supported the family, moved us to Merrick on Long Island, when I was 11. He just recently died at age 96. He was still driving and playing golf right to the end. He was the only guy I knew who at age 90 could shoot under his age. I guess that taught me something about perseverance. I went to the University of Michigan as an engineering student in 1960. I was standing outside the student union building when Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign speech that essentially announced his plan for the Peace Corps. He talked about how students could provide service for the country. It was an important moment for me. After I graduated, I worked as a computer programmer for I.B.M. for two years. By then, the Vietnam War was in full swing and the draft had accelerated. I didn't agree with the war and was interested in finding alternatives. I.B.M. applied for a delay for me twice but the application failed. I went to work at M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Labs on a project designed to create a rescue vehicle for lost submarines . I thought this job would keep me out of the draft, but M.I.T. hadn't put in the proper paperwork and I got called in for my physical. The day before my physical, I broke my ankle playing tennis and, of course, my draft board didn't believe a word of it. I had to provide X-rays. I had tears in my eyes from the pain, but a smile on my face. I started John Snow Inc. in 1978 (Dr. Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera epidemic in the 1850s). We had a very clear vision of what we would be. It would not be about making the most money but having the most impact. My goal was to attract talented people who had that passion to focus on primary care, women's health, child health, and to do great work. I also run a nonprofit called World Education, which focuses on literacy. What motivates me is going to the field, either in the United States or overseas, and seeing the people whose lives we affect. I didn't grow up rich but had the advantage of growing up in the United States and getting a good education. I couldn't have started J.S.I. in many other places. And I believe there is a duty to try and assist people who are struggling against tough situations.	"[""he didn't pass the physical examination""]"
This passage is mainly about _ .	"When Christopher Columbus landed on a land without name in 1502, he saw many Indians wearing gold earrings. So he thought the land must be rich in gold. He named the place Costa Rica, which means ""rich coast"" in Spanish. Though little gold was found, Costa Rica today is indeed rich with coffee and bananas. Coffee is the most important product in Costa Rica and most of it is exported to other countries like America and West Germany. Bananas are the country's second most important export. Costa Ricans also grow many other crops such as fruits, corn and beans for their own use. Costa Ricans love colors and their houses are painted in bright colors. Education is very important to the Costa Ricans. Almost every village has a school and education is a must for children between seven and fourteen years of age. Boys and girls go to separate schools. Classes begin in March and end in November. The other three months of the year are harvest time and the children have to help their parents to pick coffee beans."	['Costa Rica']

There are also 55 differernt species of macropods--the kangaroo family--native toAustralia. They vary greatly in size and weight, ranging from half a kilogram to 90 kilograms. The country has been making every effort to protect its natural heritage. Despite the large size of the continent, the majority of Australians live on the coast and in major cities--around 75 per cent of Australia's population lives in city areas. Australia is the driest continent on earth. Its center has one of the lowest rainfalls in the world and about three-quarters of the land is dry. These dry areas extend from the large central deserts to the western coast. Soils in these areas are very poor compared to other deserts. This has given Australians a great challenge.They have to make the best use of the variety of regions to meet the competing demands of agriculture, economy and conservation.	['350']

"The author thinks ""to judge whether a TV's influence is good or bad"" is _ ."	I was eight when my neighbors got a TV. It was small and expensive, but that didn't matter. IT WAS WONDERFUL. Everyone in the building came up to the fifth floor to see this latest wonder of the modern world. That was in 1948. Soon, a lot of people got a TV, but not us. My parents didn't think it was good for children. Being a good son, I didn't argue with them. But I secretly watch TV--at my friends' homes. By 1955, televisions weren't so expensive and were much larger. My parents still thought they were not good for us, but my sisters insisted, saying they were the only people in the neighborhood who didn't have one. All their friends talked about certain programs and actors, but they couldn't. Their friends laughed at them, which made them feel very unhappy. My youngest sister cried, saying she was never going back to school and that life without a TV wasn't worth living. Nothing my parents said made her feel better. The next morning, without telling us, they went out and got a new TV. When we were young our parents allowed us to watch TV for two hours a night. And we couldn't watch until our homework was finished. But after a year or two, TV wasn't exciting or new anymore. It became just another part of our lives like shoes or soap. My parents still had fears about TV. We were going to forget how to read, and TV was going to fill our minds with violence, they said. Today people still argue about the value of TV. Nobody can deny the power of TV, which has a powerful influence on our lives. On average, Americans spend 30 hours a week watching TV. Is this influence good or bad? This is an unanswerable question indeed: It is hard enough to measure influence; and it is even harder to decide what is good and what isn't. What is good, I suppose, is that many people are concerned about TV's influence and that we have the power to change what we don't like. The people of Monhegan Island, 18 kilometers away off the coast of Maine, don't have electricity, and they decided; once again, that they liked that way. Electricity, they think, would make life too easy and spoil their way of life. Maybe the young people wouldn't want to go to town dances anymore. Maybe they would be more interested in staying at home and watching TV.	['hard']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"When children learn a language, they learn the grammar as well as words or vocabulary. No one teaches them; children just "" _ "". Before babies begin to produce words, they produce sounds. Some of these sounds will remain if they occur in the language being learned, and others will disappear. This is called the ""babbling stage"". A child does not learn the language ""all at once"". The child first speaks only one-word ""sentences"". After a few months, the two-word stage arises. During this stage, the child puts two words together. These two-word sentences have definite patterns and express grammatical and meaningful relationships. Still later, in the telegraphic stage, the child will produce longer sentences. These longer sentences are mainly made up of content words. The child's early grammar lacks many of the rules of the adult grammar, but gradually it will become perfect. All normal children everywhere learn language. This ability is not dependent on race, social class, geography, or even intelligence . This ability is uniquely for human."	"[""children's learning of the mother language""]"

Boog is a full-grown grizzly bear that has been raised among humans by park ranger Beth. He has a warm place to live, all the food he wants, and is safe from hunters. However, when he crosses paths with the spastic mule deer Elliot, all that changes. Thanks to a series of misunderstandings, everyone believes Boog is dangerous and out of control. Beth is forced to release him back into the wild. Once Boog finds himself in the great outdoors, he has no idea what to do. He gets lost, can't find food, and is attacked by unfriendly forest cutters. Boog is forced to rely on the idiotic Elliot to help him find his way back to civilization . But can they _ before open season begins for hunting? The movie also has a really strong voice cast. Martin Lawrence voices Boog, and his attitude and persona perfectly fit the bear. The same goes for Aston Kutcher as Elliot. Even if you can't stand him in the real world, you'll be surprised how well he brings the annoying deer to life in the movie. The animation in ""Open Season"" is also excellent. The characters are quite cartoonish, but the hair is realistic looking and the movements are fantastic.

The mother chose the fields for her daughter mainly because _ .	"Walking home from work with a family friend, I found myself in a discussion about her daughter's going to college. It started with the mother telling me that she had no money to help her daughter go through college, which led the mother to push community college fiercely. She then started to say how she had been pushing ""high-paying"" fields on her daughter--doctor, engineer, lawyer, etc. When I asked her if that was what her daughter had interest in, she said no. I asked her what the point was to push her daughter into something that she didn't like, and she responded with, ""I just want her to make a good fortune."" After hearing her words, I would like to state that money is not everything. A high-paying job means nothing if you are miserable. I used to do a high-paid job, but it was very tiring and I had no time of my own. I didn't like it at all. Though the pay was good, I was not happy. So I'd like to tell parents, please do not force your children into a major or a career just because you think they are going to make a lot of money. They would feel terrible for taking that major or job just to comfort you. The worst part is the feeling of guilty when they decide to change that major to something they actually want or when they quit that job. Being a member of a generation who are willing to give ly everything to our kids, we know we just hope our children could live happy lives. Please do not force a career path on our children just because we think it is good for them. Give our children advice, but don't force them."	['she considered them to be high-paying fields']
The Town Hall reopened the Fair to _ .	"I grew up in a small town in South Canada. Every autumn, there was a week-long fair in the town. Thousands of people from other towns came to sell and buy things. It was the most exciting time of the year. When ""Fairtime"" came, my grandma became the busiest person of the family. Grandma was a kind, well-educated old lady. She was good at cooking. During ""Fairtime"", relatives would come to live in her house and have meals there. Grandma was always happy to look after them. Year after year, many people moved to big cities. There was no longer ""Fairtime"". Grandma became very old and was going a little blind. My parents and I did our best to make her life as comfortable as possible. I was at high school then. What I often did at home was to help Grandma with the daily newspaper's crossword puzzle. However, she didn't look happy. She often sat in her room for hours, without saying a word. To attract people to move back, the Town Hall decided to reopen the Fair. One day, when I came back from school, I saw Grandma wearing her glasses, washing the dishes in the kitchen. With a big smile on her face, she looked excited and a lot much younger. She told me that her two of her cousins would come. ""They said they missed hometown and wanted to enjoy my food again."" Grandma said happily. ""They will stay here for one week and we can have a big party. That must be the busiest week I've had in years!"" I suddenly realized that Grandma didn't want to be looked after. She wanted to be ""useful"", appreciated and helpful."	['attract people to move back']
The passage suggests that _ .	Every day on the road, accidents are caused. They do not only happen. The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work.

When did the meteorite incident happen?	"A meteorite flew fast across the sky and exploded over central Russia on Friday, raining fireballs over a vast area and causing a shock wave that smashed windows, damaged buildings and injured l,200 people. People heading to work in Chelyabinsk heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt the shock wave. According to Russian space agency Roscosmos, the fireball, travelling at a speed of 30km per second, had burnt very brightly across the horizon, leaving a long white trail that could be seen as far as 200km away. Car alarms went off, thousands of windows shattered and mobile phone networks were disrupted. ""I was driving to work, it was quite dark, but it suddenly became as bright as if it were day,"" said Viktor Prokofiev, 36, a resident of Yekaterinburg in the Urals Mountains. ""I felt like I was blinded by headlights."" The meteorite, which weighed about 20 tons and may have been made of iron, entered Earth's atmosphere and broke apart 30-50km above ground, according to Russia's Academy of Sciences. The energy released when it entered the Earth's atmosphere was about several thousand tons, the academy said, the power of a small atomic weapon exploding. No deaths were reported, but the Emergencies Ministry said 20,000 rescue and clean-up workers were sent to the region after President Vladimir Putin told Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov to ease the disruption and help the victims. The Interior Ministry said about l,200 people had been injured, at least 200 of them children, and most from broken pieces of glass.""While events this big are rare, an impact that could cause damage and death could happen every century or so. Unfortunately there is absolutely nothing we can do to stop impacts."""	['In the early morning.']
The text is mainly about _ .	"""Gangnam Style"" by singer Psy from Korea, is a popular song, but its extraordinary global success is really the result of its music video, which is a great piece of genius. On September 22nd, Guinness World Records listed ""Gangnam Style"" as the most-liked video in the history of YouTube. It's been performed at West Point (West-Point Style), and Google's CEO, has done the ""Gangnam Style"" horse dance at the company's office in Seoul. Even Samsung is trying to make Psy the new model for the latest type of fridge. The song's global popularity is such that the vast majority of people who enjoy it don't speak Korean, and have no idea what it is about. That's fine --- part of what makes ""Gangnam Style"" so fun is, like international pop music, the difficulty in understanding it. When we sing along, ""Hey, sexy lady"", we don't really know what we're singing about. The joy of _ is familiar to anyone who loves pop music from elsewhere. Anthony Lane, in his 2010 review of the Eurovision Song Contest, Only Mr. God Knows Why, used ""Eurovision English"" as one of its chief pleasures. It's ""a complex tongue, spoken nowhere else, which raises the heartfelt poetry but absolute nonsense to a level of what sci-fi writers could only have dreamed. "" In similar ways, ""Gangnam Style"" is just an over-the-top video where a fat man does a funny dance and sings repetitive words that don't make sense to most of us. But on the other, the magic of the song also lies in its funny dance, which reflects not just cultural morals specific to Korea, but cultural values easily recognizable to western viewers. This song's words may be in Korean, but its scenes are in clear American. The dance moves are simple enough to copy. Nonsense, in other words, forces us to let down our guards. It makes us relax, and asks us to let in all sorts of feelings from which, otherwise, we might distance ourselves. ""Gangnam Style"" happens to be so interesting because of its incomprehensibleness."

What does the last example show?	"Nowadays, a cellphone service is available to everyone, everywhere. Probably thousands of people have already been using it, but I just discovered it, so I'm going to claim it and also name it: Fake Foning. The technology has been working well for me at the office, but there are infinite applications. Virtually in any public space. Say you work at a big university with lots of talky faculty members buzzing about. Now, say you need to use the restroom. The trip down the hall will take approximately one hour, because a person can't walk into those talky people without getting pulled aside for a question, a bit of gossip, a new read on a certain line of Paradise Lost. So, a cellphone. Any cellphone. Just pick it up. Don't dial. Just hold that phone to your face and start talking. Walk confidently down the hall engaged in fake conversation, making sure to tailor both the topic and content to the person standing before you whom you are trying to avoid. For standard colleague avoidance, I suggest fake chatting about fake business: ""Yes, I'm glad you called, because we really need to hammer out the details. What's that? Yes, I read Page 12, but if you look at the bottom of 4, I think you can see the problem begins right there."" Be engaged in your fake fone conversation. Make eye contact with the people passing, nod to them, gesture keen interest in talking to them at a later time, point to your phone, shrug and move on. Shoppers should consider fake foning anytime they spot a talky neighbor in the produce department pinching unripe peaches. Without your phone at your face, you'd be in for a 20-minute speech on how terrible the world is. One important caution about fake foning. The other day I was fake foning my way past a colleague, and he was actually following me to get my attention. I knew he wanted to ask about a project I had not yet finished. I was trying to buy myself some time, so I continued fake foning with my doctor. ""So I don't need the operation? Oh, doctor, that is the best news."" And then: Brrrrrrng! Brrrrrmg! Brrrrrmg! My phone started ringing, right there while it was planted on my face. My colleague looked at me, and I at him, and naturally I gasped. ""What is the matter with this thing?"" I said, pulling the phone away to look at it, and then putting it back to my ear. ""Hello? Are you still there?"" Oops."	['One has to be careful while fake foning.']
How long after moving to Chicago did Sarah Outland take a staycation?	"Sarah Outland's weeklong ""staycation"" gave her a chance to explore her new surroundings after moving to Chicago. A day after moving to the Windy City last year, Outland started a new job and never got a chance to explore her new surroundings. After nine months as a resident, she finally took a week off work to visit famous landmarks, museums and shopping centers that were right under her nose. If you glance through a newspaper or listen to a news broadcast recently, you may hear or spot a strange word, ""staycation"". Staycation is a new word the American press is employing to describe a vacation very close to your home, or simply staying at home during your vacation. It is a combination of words ""stay""and ""vacation"". According to many news reports, these staycations are achieving great popularity among American families this year. When asked about the reason for their expected staycation, respondents stated ""gas prices are too high"" (61 percent), ""travel in general is too expensive (44 percent). The high price of gas for cars and airplanes has made it very expensive for Americans to travel compared to past years. When you combine this with the weak American dollar, it all adds up to people deciding to stay close to home during their traditional summer vacations. For aggressive young Americans who are trying to balance family and work, a staycation can be a great concept. They want to enjoy their homes and the attractions in their area without the stress of packing or making reservation. They won't be paying high fuel prices either directly, at the pump, or indirectly, in airfare, other than the gas required to drive around town. Absolutely, it's friendlier on the environment when locals take trips to attractions in their own area, and not everyone is game for a vacation that involves staying on a hotel compound. Few people live close enough to a real destination to make this worth their while."	['Nine months']
What effect does Jovan want his email to have on Mr. Mallory?	"From: jovangagic56@memail. com To: kmallory@LN.org Subject: Hi! Dear Mr. Mallory, I am writing to tell you my deep disappointment for my experience at Lingua Nova English summer school in the first two weeks of July. I had been thoroughly looking forward to learning English and learning about culture in the UK, but I am afraid that my time at your summer school failed to live up to my expectations. Your brochure states that the student accommodation is situated ""in the heart of Edinburgh"". This is misleading as my accommodation was, in fact, situated a good fifty minutes bus ride from the city center in what I can only describe as a less than picturesque part of the suburbs. In addition, the activity programme did not reflect the fact that we were located in one of Europe's most interesting and historical cities: one evening activity consisted of a walk to a nearby park, another was a trip to a narrow street which was not usually used by cars. Finally, on our one trip into the city center our ""guide"" readily admitted that she was not from Edinburgh, and had in fact never visited the city before. I had been eagerly expecting a guided tour of Scotland's treasures. In fact, I was left in the city center with no map and told to ""check things out"" while your employee went shopping in Princes Street. This was a long awaited trip and cost me over two years' hard work and saving. Although I do have positive memories of my trip (my English teachers were knowledgeable and inspiring), the accommodation and activity programme were wholly unsatisfactory. I would like to get my money back for the accommodation and would really appreciate a reply within the next two weeks. Yours sincerely, Jovan Gagic"	['To make him feel sorry.']
What wasn't included in the writer's second time plan?	In general, it's hard to spend enough time in both concentrating on lessons and taking part in social activities. But I wanted to succeed in both. I knew this would be a challenge but I didn't realize how difficult it was until my classes in the high school began. I got on well with other girls. After school, I often had ice cream with them first instead of finishing my homework before it was time to hand it in. I always finished it the next day between classes. I knew it wasn't very good and the grades that I get showed I was not hard-working enough. I realized that I needed to find some kind of balance. So I created a timetable that would divide my time between studying and relaxing. It was a good idea but I was only able to follow it for a few days because it made me under too much pressure. Later, I tried another plan. Each week I listed everything that I had to get done during the week and the time by which I had to get it done. Then under the things I had to do, I made another list of things that I could do if I had time. It worked really well. Ever since I have never missed any important things. At the same time, I enjoyed my spare time a lot. Planning my time has been challenging, but I continue to do it. I'm glad that I've learned to balance things and it has helped prepare for what is coming after graduation.	"[""The things she shouldn't do.""]"
What is the main idea of the passage?	"Except for a few times, Americans are not big present-givers. There's no exchange of presents among business people, and if one American tries to give another a present, it may look like that he wants to bribe him. Americans have learned that in some other countries people like to give presents to others, but among ourselves we don't see the need for presents. Even friends may never exchange presents. When I go to foreign countries, I try to bring back little things for _ but nobody would feel unhappy if I didn't. I don't often remember a friend's birthday, and few people outside of my family remember mine. If someone gave me presents too often, I'd get unpleasant. But a present from a foreigner - that kind from his or her homeland -- won't go wrong, except to government employees who can't be given presents. You usually open a present at once and in front of the person who gives it except Christmas and birthday presents. You should only say, ""It's so nice. Thanks..."" when you get Christmas or birthday presents. You may want to bring a bottle of wine or flowers to a dinner party, but you're never asked to. Nobody will mind if you bring wine, but your friend may not use it that evening. At Christmas we often give presents to our family and sometimes our friends. We also give presents to people who have been helpful during the year- doormen, babysitters, housecleaners, newspaper senders-- anyone who has often helped us."

When visiting an exhibition in town,country people have to _ .	Urban citizens can enjoy a more colorful life than rural citizens.Townspeople are wellinformed because they have the easier access to news,while country people are uniformed because these districts are hard to get to.Urban traffic is so welldeveloped that the residents there often visit exhibitions and parks which are only a short bus ride away. For country people this is a major operation which involves considerable planning.Shopping,a necessary activity in everyday life is more convenient in the city than in the countryside. Townspeople can buy what they want at any time of a day.But rural residents go to town at most once a week.So after shopping they always stagger home loaded with heavy purchases. As for as meals and clothes concerned,townspeople are wellfed and welldressed as there is an adequate supply of goods.But rural residents are too busy to pay particular attention to them.It is for these reasons that more and more people are moving into the city and looking for a rest there. On the contrary,some people are attracted by the rural area.Air pollution,noise and overcrowding which are the biggest problems confronting townspeople seem strange for rural residents.Medical studies have proved that rural residents can live longer than urban residents, because they are free from a polluted environment. In addition,the crime rate in the city is several times higher than in the countryside.As is known to all,the life in any city is much more expensive than in the countryside.So the safe, quiet and cheap life in the country appeals to(......)many city residents. Either an urban or a rural area gives pleasure and trouble.But,I believe,the suburban area has the excellencies of both and is superior to both.As the automobile industry develops,more and more people will make their homes in suburban areas.

What would be the best title for the text?	"More than half of the parents in the United States are helping, or have helped, support their adult children who have been hit by high unemployment and poor wages , according to a new survey. It showed that present economic conditions are discouraging young adults from leaving home and forcing those who have already gone, so-called boomerang kids, to return. ""Parents are continuing their financial involvement longer than we expected,"" said Ted Beck, president of National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE). About 60 percent of parents questioned in the survey said they're helping their adult children who are no longer in school financially. Half are providing housing and nearly half are helping with living expenses. For an increasing number of adult children, the situation is bad. Two-thirds of adult children, aged 18 to 39, who are not in school said they faced tougher financial pressures than previous generations, according to the survey. And nearly one-third of parents agreed that it was easier for them to find their financial feet than for their children. Parents are helping their children out of genuine concern because they do not want to see them struggle. But Beck said that parents who make sacrifices to help their adult children should be careful about their own finances. ""If you are taking on extra debt or delaying retirement to help your adult child, you could be making a mistake and putting your own financial future in danger,"" Beck warned. Boomerang children can also cause other problems for their parents. Thirty percent of parents said they had given up privacy since their adult children moved back home, while more than a quarter have taken on added debt, and seven percent have delayed retirement. But the survey also showed 42 percent of adult children living at home are helping with the cooking and cleaning."	['Parents help support adult children']

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"There is no excuse for not doing yourassignments . If you can't come to school, you should call your teacher or your classmate and ask about homework. It is yourresponsibility to find out what homework you have missed. It is not the teacher's job to remind you of the missed assignments. You must not be absent on a test day. If you are seriously ill, call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows amake-up test ,you should take the test within one or two days after you return to class. Serious illness is the only reason for missing a test. Be on time! It is impolite to be late. Also, it bothers other students. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Have your books and papers out of your bag before you come into the room. Then go to your seat and sit down quietly. In the USA, it is not necessary to knock before you enter the classroom. Most teachers will give you a low grade if you are often late. In America, you should call your teacher by his or her last name instead of "" teacher"". Also you should use Mr, Miss, Ms or Mrs before the last name ( such as Mrs Smith or Mr Jones). This is polite. The teacher will tell you the title that he or she likes. It is impolite in the USA to eat, drink or chew gum during class. Don't do these until the break. Also, removing your shoes in the classroom is not polite."	['When a student is late for class, he / she must knock before he / she enters the\nclassroom.']

What's the influence of writing letters to Toby?	"In June 2013 a five-year-old boy, Toby, was walking home from school thinking about the long summer ahead. Money was tight that year and Toby's parents had told him they would not be able to afford a holiday. Instead of dreaming about foreign travel, he had been reading a book, Letter to New Zealand, where the author explains what happens in an envelope's journey from England to the other side of the world. As they neared their house, Toby asked his mum, Sabine, if he could write a letter to New Zealand. After a few more steps he was struck by an even better idea. ""Can I write a letter to every country in the world?"" Sabine says she often wonders what would have happened if she had replied differently that day. ""It was just one of those typical questions that five-year-olds have,"" she says. "" If he had asked me in the evening when I was tired, I might have refused. But as parents you realize there's a lot of power in just allowing kids to have a go. Also, it seemed a nice way to do some armchair exploration. So I told him"" Let's see how far you get."" The answer was very far indeed. Toby has since written and posted letters to all 193 UN mumber states, as well as numerous other bad-conditioned areas with comforting ones. To date he has written 681 letters- the best of which have been selected to appear in a new book called Dear World, How Are You?- although so productive is Toby' pen that the number will have risen by the time you read this. ""Writing these letters has made me realize that the world isn't actually all that big,"" he says with a grin. In the future, part of him would like to be a musical director to turn his beloved Star Wars into a ballet. Of course, he also hopes to travel the globe in person to see some of the countries where his letters have ended up. ""We're so lucky to have this wonderful world, and I hope we can live on planet Earth in peace."""	['He understands more about the world.']
The brown bear approached the family in order to _ .	"The Brown Bear My wife Laura and I were on the beach, with three of our children, taking pictures of shore birds near our home in Alaska when we spotted a bear. The bear was thin and small, moving aimlessly. Just a few minutes later, I heard my daughter shouting, ""Dad! The bear is right behind us!"" An agreesive bear will usually rush forward to frighten away its enemy but would suddenly stop at the last minute. This one was silent and its ears pinned back---- the sign of an animal that is going in for the kill. And it was a cold April day. The bear behaved abnormally, probably because of hunger. I held my camera tripod in both hands to form a barrier as the bear rushed into me. Its huge head was level with my chest and shoulders, and the tripod stuck across its mouth. It bit down and I found myself supporting its weight. I knew I would not be able to hold it for long. Even so, this was a fight I had to win: I was all that stood between the bear and my family, who would stand little chance of running faster than a brown bear. The bear hit at the camera, cutting it off the tripod. I raised my left arm to protect my face; the beast held tightly on the tripod and pressed it into my side. My arm could not move, and I sensed that my bones were going to break. Drawing back my free hand, I struck the bear as hard as I could for five to six times. The bear opened its mouth and I grasped its fur, trying to push it away. I was actually wrestling with the bear at this point. Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the fight ended. The bear moved back toward the forest, before returning for another attack----- The first time I felf panic. Apparently satisfied that we caused no further threat, the bear moved off, destroying a fence as it went. My arm was injured, but the outcome for us could hardly have been better. I'm proud that my family reminded clear-headed when panic could have led to a very different outcome."	['start an attack']

What might be the best title for the passage?	"Recently, a student used his Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to film a female teacher scolding and tearing the work of a classmate. The public discussion that the incident caused started on the Internet. However, when it came to the media's attention, it quickly became a major topic in the education circles. The reactions so far suggest that the focus of the debate has been on one question: whom to blame? Teachers who are anxious to defend their professional dignity have tried to put the blame on the students. They mentioned their right to privacy )and for this reason they requested the Ministry of Education (MOE) to prohibit PDAs in schools. On the other hand, some parents and students have taken a different position. They feel that the teacher is also at fault. Caught up in the war of words between both sides, people are no longer interested in the ""truth"" of the matter which seems now unimportant. It was left to newspapers to discover the central point of the controversial issue, by stressing the problems that are not always easily noticed in our educational system. For those responsible for educating the young, this PDA incident conveys the message that ""Times have changed"",a reality that must have been felt even more strongly by the female teacher when reflecting on this unpleasant experience. Different times call for different professional approaches in education. The ability to understand the students they are teaching has always been the quality of successful teachers. Despite some factors, the incident shows that the teacher lacks good qualities on her part. Besides, the rules under current system to deal with recalcitrant students need to be improved. Also, it is an example which shows the issue we are familiar with: what to do with new technology? With PDA, the new technology, the interaction between the teacher and students in classroom has been changed."	['Whom to blame?']
Which of the following statements is true?	"When a dirty and untidy orange cat showed up in the prison yard,I was one of the first to go out there and pet it.I hadn't touched a cat or a dog in over 20 years.I spent at least 20 minutes,knelt down behind the kitchen as the cat rolled around,relaxed.What he was expressing outwardly, I was feeling inwardly.It was an amazing bit of grace to feel him under my hand and note that I was reaching a life or another creature with something as simple as my care. Over the next few days,there were other prisoners responding to the cat.Every yard period,a group of prisoners gathered there.They stood around talking and taking turns petting the cat.These were guys you wouldn't usually find talking to each other.Several times I saw an officer in the group,not chasing people away, but just watching and seeming to enjoy along with the prisoners.Bowls of milk and water appeared along with bread, wisely placed under the edge of the dustbin to keep the birds from getting it. The cat was obviously homeless and in pretty bad shape.People said that the cat came to the right place.He's getting treated like a king.This was true.but as 1 watched 1 was also thinking about what the cat was doing for us.There was a lot of talk about what's wrong with prisons in America.We need more programs.We need more psychologists or treatment of various kinds.Some may even talk about making prisons more kind.But I think what we really need is a chance to practise our own kindness.Not receive it,but give it.After more than two decades here,I know kindness is not a value that's encouraged.It's often seen as a weakness. Instead,the culture encourages keeping your head down,minding your own business,and never letting yourself be weak. The cat did my heart good to see the effect he had on me and the men here.By simply saying,""I need some help here"",he did something important for us.He needed us.And we needed to be needed.I believe we all do."

What can be the best title for the text?	"Today's demands for measuring childhood success have chased household chores from the to-do lists of many young people. In a survey of 1,001 US adults released by Braun Research, 82% reported having regular chores growing up, but only 28% said that they require their own children to do them. ""Parents today want their kids spending time on things that can bring them success, but ironically, we've stopped doing one thing that's actually been a proven predictor of success--and that's household chores."" says Richard Rende, a developmental psychologist. Giving children household chores at an early age helps to build a lasting sense of mastery, responsibility and independence, according to research by Marty Rossmann, professor at the University of Minnesota. In 2002, Dr. Rossmann analyzed data from a longitudinal study that followed 84 children across four periods. She found that young adults who began chores at ages 3 and 4 were more likely to have good relationships with family and friends and to achieve academic and early career success, as compared with those who didn't have chores or who started them as teens. Chores also teach children how to be empathetic and responsive to others' needs, notes psychologist Richard Weissbourd. In research, his team surveyed 10,000 high-school students and asked them to rank what they treasured more: achievement, happiness or caring for others. Almost 80% chose either achievement or happiness over caring for others. As he points out, however, research suggests that personal happiness comes most reliably not from high achievement but from strong relationships. ""We're out of balance,"" says Dr. Weissbourd. A good way to start re-adjusting priorities , he suggests, is by learning to be kind and helpful at home. The next time that your child asks to skip chores to do homework, resist the urge to let him or her off the hook. Being slack about chores when they compete with school sends your child the message that grades and achievement are more important than caring about others. What may seem like small messages in the moment but add up to big ones over time."	['Children need regular chores']
Who was robbed of the watch on earth?	A Frenchman went to a small Italian town and was staying with his wife at the best hotel there. One night, he went out for a walk alone. It was late and the small street was dark and quiet. Suddenly he felt someone behind him. He turned his head and saw an Italian young man who quickly walked past him. The man was nearly out of sight when the Frenchman suddenly found that his watch was gone. He thought that it must be the Italian who had taken his watch. He decided to follow him and get back the watch. Soon the Frenchman caught up with the Italian. Neither of them understood the other's language. The Frenchman frightened the Italian with his fist and pointed at the Italian's watch. In the end the Italian gave up his watch to the Frenchman. When he returned to the hotel, the Frenchman told his wife what had happened. He was greatly surprised when his wife pointed to the watch on the table. Now he realized that by mistake he had robbed the watch and it was the Italian's.	['The Italian was.']
According to the passage, some doctors believe it is true that _ .	"When did you last see a polar bear? On a trip to a zoo, perhaps? If you had attended a winter activity in New York a few years ago, you would have seen a whole polar bear club. These ""Polar Bears"" are people who meet frequently in winter to swim in freezing cold water. That day, air temperature was 3degC, and the water temperature was a bit higher. The members of the Polar Bear Club at Coney Island , New York are usually about the age of 60. Members must satisfy two requirements. First, they must get along well with everyone else in the group, this is very important because there are so many different kinds of people in the club. Polar Bears must also agree to swim outdoors at least twice a month from November through February. Doctors do not agree about the medical effects of cold-water swimming. Some are worried about the dangers of a condition in which the body's temperature drops so low that finally the heart stops. Other doctors, however, point out that there is more danger of a heart attack during summer swimming because the difference between the air temperature and water temperature is much greater in summer than in winter. The Polar Bears themselves are satisfied with the benefits(or advantages) of cold-water swimming. They say that their favorite form of exercise is very good for the circulatory system because it forces the blood to move fast to keep the body warm. Cold-water swimmers usually turn bright red after a few minutes in the water. A person who turns blue probably has a very poor circulatory system and should not try cold-water swimming. The main benefits(or advantages) of cold-water swimming are probably mental . The Polar Bears love to swim year-round; they find it fun and relaxing. As one 70-year-old woman says,""When I go into the water, I pour my troubles into the ocean and let them float away ."""	['cold-water swimming causes more heart attacks in summer than in winter']
How do American youngsters earn their allowance? Which one is NOT one of the ways?	Many American youngsters earn their own allowance by doing temporary jobs for their neighbors. Babysitting is one of the common of these jobs. Most couples do not have maids or relatives living with them, and they need to have someone watch the children if they want to go out. Another way is by mowing lawn in summer and clearing snow from sidewalks and driveways in winter. Many people mow their own lawns,but often people prefer to give the job to a neighbor's child. In winter, snow clearing from streets and highways is the government's responsibility. Homeowners or tenants, however, must clear sidewalks and driveways. Since clearing snow is very tiring, many people prefer to hire teenagers for this job rather than do it themselves. Besides, many American teenagers usually work two to three hours after school and all day on Saturday or Sunday at the local supermarket. They work as cashiers or stockroom clerks. Or they help customers carry things to their cars. Other favorite jobs are waiting on tables in restaurants or working part-time at stores or gas stations. By earning their own allowance,teenagers acquire a feeling of independence and a sense of responsibility which prepares them for a productive life in society.

To protect people from suffering from heart attack, doctors have paid much attention to _ .	"That ""Monday morning feeling"" could be a crushing pain in the chest which leaves you sweating and gasping for breath. Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break. The risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2,600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 per cent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day. Working Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 per cent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day. A study of 11,000 Italians proved 8 am on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewer heart attacks in both countries. The findings could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. ""We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them,"" he said. Monday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work. ""When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies,"" Willich explained. ""All these things can have an unfavourable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries which will cause a heart attack."" ""When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes. They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger and more physical activity,"" said Willich."

The last sentence of this passage indicates that the author's attitude towards the U.S economy in 2008 is	The Growing Credit Crisis Forces Many Companies to Seek Government Help On September fifteenth, Lehman Brothers, a one hundred fifty-eight year-old investment bank, sought legal protection from its creditors. It had failed to find a buyer after months of searching. With over six hundred billion dollars in debt, Lehman's failure was the largest bankruptcv in United States history At the same time,the nation's biggest insurance company,American International Group, had gotten into trouble selling credit default swaps These are contracts Similar to insurance that protect the holder against credit risk. Credit rating agencies downgraded A.I.G because of concerns it could not honor its contracts. Unable to get new loans, A.I.G asked for government help The Federal Reserve agreed to loan A .I.G. eighty-five billion dollars in return for eighty percent of the company but it was not enough. By November, the government had extended a total of about one hundred fiftv billion doliars in aid to A .I.G--the most to any single company during the crisis. As banks refused to lend, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed a plan to loosen credit markets by buylng risky assets. Congress approved the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of Two. Thousand eight on October third The bill provided seven hundred billion dollars to buy hard to-value securltles from banks. But within weeks, the government changed plans. The Treasury moved to invest two handred fifty billion dollars directly in banks to help them lend money again. Lack of credit not only hurt banks but manufacturers, too. Falling car sales threatened America's carmakers The big three automakers--General Motors, Ford and Chrysler--told Congress that they needed loans or they faced bankmptcy. In December, President Bush offered G.M and Chrysler over seventeen billion dollars in loans. As the year ended, the Federal Reserve tried to support economic growth by lowering its main interest rate to nearly zero for the first time. But there was one more bad surprise New York money manager Bernard Madoff admitted he had cheated investors out of fifty billion dollars. The news only added to the sense that two thousand eight was the worst economic year since the nineteen thirties.	['pessimistic']
The writer wants to tell us _ .	"I attended a birthday party in 1991. My teacher was then 59 years old. But her fellow teacher said that we were celebrating her 39thbirthday! We were all surprised and puzzled. After the party I was told by the fellow teacher that American women have a special saying about birthdays. If a woman is over 40, or even if she is 80, her birthday is always the 39th. If she is in her thirties, her birthday will be the 29th. And in her twenties, it's the 19th. They usually have their ""real"" birthday when they are below 20. This shows that American women, especially elderly women, are very sensitive about their ages. But my teacher always says, ""We want to be younger,"" so about the age of Western women, my advice is that if you don't know it, don't ask about it; if you really know it, don't mention it."	"[""not to ask a Western woman's age whether you know her well or not""]"
Who or what saved the girl's life?	"There was once an ant that was very thirsty. It ran here and there looking for some water but could not find any. Then suddenly, when the ant was almost ready to die of thirst, a large drop of water fell on it. The ant drank the water, which saved its life. The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings. The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds. ""Why are you sad?"" asked the ant. ""I'm the prisoner of a giant."" the girl told the ant. "" He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley and rye out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together."" ""That will take you a month!"" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds. ""I know,"" the girl cried, ""and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!"" ""Don't cry,"" the ant said, ""my friends and I will help you."" Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds. The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life."	['Her tears']
How many solutions to the water problem in San Diego are mentioned in the article?	"If California were not already so famous for Sillicon Valley and Hollywood, it might be well-known for the groups of water-technology firms in its San Diego County. The reverse-osmosis (RO) spiral module, the technique that supports turning seawater and waste-water into drinkable stuff, began in San Diego in 1964. Today dozens of firms in the area supply many of the world's approximately 13,000 RO plants in places from the Persian Gulf and Israel to Australia and China. Southern California itself, however, has not so far been a big user of its own technology. This is surprising, given that the whole American south-west faces a water problem. But now as the climate gets warmer and the population increases, there is more agreement that the existing infrastructure, consisting of vast pipes that carry water from the Sacramento Delta in the north and the Colorado River in the east, will not be enough. In places such as San Diego, which has inadequate and salty groundwater and currently imports 90% or its water, the answers must be greater conservation, reusing as much water as possible, and getting most of the rest from the sea. The first part, conservation, has been widely accepted by the public. San Diego today uses less water with a larger population than it did in 1989, the year water consumption peaked. The second part, water recycling has been a hard sell, because of an unpleasant factor. Americans still use the term ""toilet-to-tap"" for recycling, even though properly treated waste-water is nowadays completely clean. Singapore made its programme acceptable in part by renaming it as NEWater. This is where desalination comes in, which means taking the salt out of salt water. A firm called Poseidon Resources is now close to building the biggest desalination plant in America behind a power station by the beach in Carlsbad. The power plant sucks in 304m gallons of seawater a day for cooling, so Poseidon plans to change 104m gallons a day by using the RO spiral module. Lots of people like the idea. Once fully running in 2015, the plant could produce 10% of the region's water. And there are plans for more desalination plants. Many places would need to take much less water from the endangered Colorado River. But a few people hate it a lot. Joe Geever, an expert in biology, says desalination uses too much energy and that Poseidon plant would kill too much sea life. He understands that there is a role for desalination, he says, but would rather not have it right there, right now, and on this scale."	['3.']
By reading the text, how do you feel about the communication of the world today?	"Now people who are in different parts of the world communicate easier than before. But it is a little hard to understand each other well. Some of them may not understand others' words, so it's easy to make a few mistakes. For example, an important question about eating out, is who pays for the meal. If a friend of yours suggests you have lunch with him, you might simply say something like this, ""I'm afraid it will have to be some place inexpensive, as I have very little money."" The other person might say, ""OK. I will meet you at McDonald's."" This means it is agreed that the two will go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He might also say, ""Oh, no. I want to take you to lunch at Johnson's"", or "" I want you to try the steak there. It is great."" This means that the person intends to pay the bill for both of you. If you feel friendly towards this person, there is no reason why you shouldn't accept this invitation. You might simply say, ""Thank you. That would be very nice."" ,."	['It gets easier.']
Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?	The coast of the State of Maine is one of the most irregular in the world. A straight line running from the southernmost coastal city to the northernmost coastal city would measure about 225 miles. If you followed the coastline between these points, you would travel more than ten times as far. This irregularity is the result of what is called a drowned coastline. The term comes from the glacial activity of the Ice Age. At that time, the whole area that is now Maine was part of a mountain range that towered above the sea. As the glacier descended, however, it applied enormous force on those mountains, and they sank into the sea. As the mountains sank, ocean water charged over the lowest parts of the remaining land. And the highest parts of the former mountain range, nearest the shore, remained as islands. Marine fossils found here are 225 feet above sea level indicating the level of the shoreline prior to the glacier. The 2,500-mile-long rocky and jagged coastline of Maine keeps watch over nearly 2,000 islands. Many of these islands are tiny and uninhabited, but many are home to blooming communities. Mt. Desert Island is one of the largest, most beautiful of the Maine coast islands left behind by the glacier. Measuring 16 miles by 12 miles, Mt. Desert was very nearly formed as two distinct islands. It is split almost in half by Somes Sound, a very deep and very narrow stretch of water seven miles long. For years, Mt. Desert Island, particularly its major settlement, Bar Harbor, has afforded summer homes for the wealthy. Recently, though, Bar Harbor has become a new arts community as well. But the best part of the island is the unspoiled forest land known as Acadia National Park. Since the island sits on the border between two different geographical zones, the park supports the plants and animals of both zones. It also lies in a major bird migration lane and is a resting spot for many birds. The establishment of Acadia National park in 1916 means that this natural monument will be preserved and that it will be available to all people, not just the wealthy. Visitors to Acadia may receive nature instruction from the park naturalists as well as enjoy camping, hiking, cycling, and boating. Or they may choose to spend time at the museum learning about the Stone Age inhabitants of the island.	['The past and the present of Maine']
What is the main difference between the hotel designed by Ale Remizov and other hotels?	"The rising sea waters caused by global warming have inspired a Russian architect to design a hotel that could be built on water as well as land.The eco-friendly ""Ark"" could be constructed in just a few months anywhere in the world, the designer says. It's called ""The Ark"",but looks more like a ship sitting upside down on the water.A new design by Russian architect A1exander Remizov challenges the tradition of land-based hotel and would provide a shelter in the future--should the world face a modern-day flood as described in the Bible. The building of the hotel could be fast and simple.""Prefabricated section could be put together in three to four months,"" Remizov said. The versatile structure could be constructed in most corners of the earth, even in earthquake-prone areas.Constructing ""The Ark""--which would include 14 000 square meters of living space---would cost roughly the same as building an energy-efficient house. The self-supporting structure would be built around a central post, connecting wind generators and heat pumps on its roof with the basement,where solar,wind,and thermal energy could be stored and turned into electricity. Remizov has designed the building without glass,choosing instead the lasting and self-cleaning foil that could defend itself against rough weather conditions.That foil would be fastened to metals,which would also collect rainwater.The building would also feature an indoor jungle, creating its microclimate."

John's grandma wasn't happy because _ .	"John is thirteen now. He began to study in a middle school two years ago. His home is in a small village and it's nearly five kilometers from the school. He has to get up early in the morning. After a quick breakfast, he has to run to school and get there on time. His father hopes to borrow some money to buy a bike for him, but he knows his mother is always ill and his father spends much money on medicine. He doesn't agree with him and keeps running there every day. Now he's very strong and never late for class and his teachers often praise him. Last week there was a sports meeting in his school. John ran faster than any other boy and won the boys' 800 meters, 1,500 meters and 3,000 meters. The whole school knew him. He was very happy. He told his grandma about the good news as soon as he got home. ""I broke two school records today, Granny."" called out the boy. To his surprise, the old woman wasn't happy. She thought for a while and said, ""I'm sorry to hear that. We have no money to pay for them, you know!"""	['she thought John had broken some things and they had to pay for them']
According to Cacioppo, lonely people .	"Loneliness is like a disease, and what's worse, it's contagious. It can spread from one person to another, according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person's emotions to affect even people they don't know. The new analysis, involving 4,793 people who were interviewed every two years between 2005 and 2015, showed that a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview. A friend of that person was 25% more likely, and a friend of a friend of a friend was 15% more likely. ''Loneliness is not just the property of an individual. It can be transmitted across people--even people you don't have direct contact with,"" said John T. Cacioppo, a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Loneliness has been linked to medical problems, including depression, sleep problems and generally poorer physical health. Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health, experts said. Although the study did not examine how loneliness spreads, Cacioppo said another research has provided clues. ""Let's say for whatever reason you get lonely. You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion. That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they _ their social ties and become lonely,"" Cacioppo said. According to Cacioppo, loneliness spread more easily among women than men, perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions. Lonely people become less and less trusting others. This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends--and more likely that society will reject them. Therefore, it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness. Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks."	['will probably be deserted by society']
The extra money brought in by both parents _ .	"Should you stay at home to look after your child,or return to work? Maybe you don't have the option.Combining work and motherhood is an issue faced by increasing numbers of women every day. New research for the Institute for Economic and Social Research could solve this quandary once and for all.In short,it concludes that going back to work after the birth of a child can have a negative impact on the child's development--unless you have lots of money. ""Growing up in a family in which the mother chooses to work appears to have some adverse consequences for children's welfare,"" the research says.However,it adds that extra money brought in by both parents can reduce the negative effect.The negative effect is also less apparent in children of bettereducated mothers. The research by John Ermisch and Marco Francesconi is especially downbeat about welfare to work programmes,and especially,the prospects for the children of some single parents. ""It is hard to see anything but gloomy prospects for the children of single parents (who are generally poor),"" the researchers said.This is because in a common family where both parents work,extra money brought in by the mother's working would compensate for less time spent with the children. In contrast,the researchers said the effects of paternal employment were far more modest,but this did not mean that fathers had no role in shaping their children's welfare.Money brought in by the father would be a major resource for helping children develop. The research says,however,that before parents get too carried away by worrying about working,there are more important issues facing a child's development.Parents' personalities and emotional stability,parenting practices,and the friends and networks that children experience while growing up will be much bigger factors than whether their mothers work."

What did Russell Lyons think of his first volunteering?	"When Russell Lyons volunteered for the first time, he read Goodnight Moon to a class of San Diego preschoolers. And it wasn't reading-he'd memorized the book and was reciting it out loud. He was 4. Still, he said it felt good up there, in front of the other kids, lending a hand. He wanted more of that feeling. Thirteen years later, he's getting a lot of it. He's on a five-month road trip across America-not sightseeing, but volunteering. The University City resident has spent time at an animal reserve in Utah, a women's shelter in St. Louis, a soup kitchen in New York, a retirement home in Tucson. This week he's in Los Angeles, at a program that supports disabled youth. ""I just like helping people and feeling that something I do is making a difference,"" he said. He resists the idea that his ""Do Good Adventure"" is all that unusual. It bothers him that the media often describes young people as lazy, self-centered and materialistic. So he sees his trip as a chance to make a statement, too. ""About 55 percent of teens do volunteer work, higher than the rate of adults,"" he said, according to a 2002 study. ""Not everybody knows that."" Of course, some teens do volunteer work because it looks impressive on their college applications. Lyons said he mentioned his trip on his submissions. But charity work is a habit with him. Even before the cross country trip, he was volunteering abut 200 hours a year at various places. He's made sandwiches for homeless families in Washington D.C.. He's taught math to fifth-graders in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He gets some of that drive from his mother, Leslye Lyons, who has been involved in nonprofits for much of her life. She was there when her son ""read"" to the preschoolers-a memory of hers ""that will never go away."""	['Impressive.']
The example of Heo Young Ho shows that _ .	"Lego,the inventor of those color1ful bricks that have inspired kids' imagination worldwide,has celebrated its 53rd anniversary. In 1958,a man named Godtfred created the plastic building bricks that can now be found in almost every child's toy box. The simple building block has become one of the most well-known and popular toys around the world. ""The Lego brick continues to be very attractive,because it allows children,and others,to develop their creativity and imagination,"" said Charlotte Simonsen,a spokeswoman of Lego. The company's building brick allows an endless number of links. With just two bricks there are 24 different links,and with six,there are 915 million possibilities,according to Lego. A half century after its creation,more than 400 million children and adults spend five billion hours a year putting the bricks together and pulling them apart. Also,the bricks made today can still link with those made in 1958. Lego bricks aren't just child's play: they also attract the interest of adults. South Korean adventurer,Heo Young Ho,who climbed Mount Everest in 1987,left a Lego toy behind in the snow during his climb. After its great success Lego experienced a serious crisis at the end of the 1990s,hit hard by competition from electronic games. Lego then suffered a dark period that lasted several years. With great efforts,the company began to be popular again,and in 2006 it earned about 1.5 billion dollars in 130 countries. Seven boxes of Lego are now sold every second around the world,and 19 billion bricks are produced each year: enough to encircle the Earth five times!"

There are few plants, trees and flowers in Holland now because _ .	"1970 was ""World Conservation Year"". The United Nations wanted everyone to know that the world was in danger. They hoped that the governments would act quickly in order to conserve nature. Here is one example of the problem. At one time there were 1300 different plants, trees and flowers in Holland, but now only 860 remain. The others have been destroyed by modern man and his technology. We are changing the earth, the air and the water, and everything that grows and lives. We can't live without these things. If we continue like this, we shall destroy ourselves. What will happen in the future? Perhaps it is more important to ask ""What must we do now?"" The people who will be living in the world of tomorrow are the young of today. A lot of them know that conservation is necessary. Many are hoping to save our world. They plant trees, build bridges across rivers in forests and so on. In a small town in the United States a large group of girls cleaned the banks of eleven kilometres of their river. Young people may hear about conservation through a record called ""No, One's Going to Change our World. "" It was made by Scatles, Cliff Richard and other singers. The money from it will help to conserve wild animals."	"[""many plants, trees and flowers don't grow there any more""]"
Who helped Jack remember the things?	"Jack is a twelve-year-old boy. One day, he was playing football. The ball went into the street and Jack ran for it. Unfortunately, a car hit him.

Once Jim knew a beautiful girl called Mabel at a friend's party. They danced for several times and the girl was deeply in love. But Mabel's parents didn't agree to marry their daughter to a poor young man. So they began to travel in America and didn't let the girl come back to London. She wrote a letter to Jim and told him about it. Of course the young man hadn't enough money to go to see her. He was so sad that he began to drink. It was Saturday one day. Jim didn't go to work. He came to a bar and sat down to drink. Just then an old friend of his came in. He asked him to drink with him. Crying, he told Mike all and the young man felt sorry for him. After a while they were both drunk and left. Mike wanted to take his friend home. When they passed a zoo, they went in and walked to a cage in which there were two tigers. Having seen them, a tiger roared. Mike was afraid and said, ""Let's go. Let's go. It's dangerous to stand here."" ""I don't think so,"" said Jim. "" I'm watching TV now""."	"[""he's able""]"
Some students left the classroom because _ .	"The teacher stood before his class of 30 students and was going to hand out the final exam papers. ""I know how hard you have all worked to get ready for this test. "" he said. ""And because I know you are all able to understand these questions. I am ready to offer a B to anyone who would prefer not to take the test. '' A number of students jumped up to thank the teacher and left the classroom. The teacher looked at the rest students and said. ""Does anyone else want to get a B? This is your last chance. ""Two more students decided to go. Seven students stayed. The teacher then handed out the papers. There were only three sentences on the paper: Congratulations! You have received an A in this class. Keep believing in yourself. I never had a teacher who gave a test like that. but I think that it is a test that any teacher could and should give. Students who do not have confidence in what they have learned are B students at most. The same is true for students in real life. The A students are those who believe in what they are doing because they have learned from both successes and failures. They have learned life's lessons. whether from school education or from events in their lives,and have become better people. Scientists say that by the age of eight,80% of what we believe about ourselves has already been formed. You are a big kid now and you realize that you have some limits .

What's the main idea of this passage?	"In April this year, lots of bags full of small change were seen at bus stops in Tianjin. They were made for passengers to turn their notes into small change. And such an idea came from four students from Zhongbei Middle School, Tianjin. ""People will surely feel worried when they take a bus without coins. We just want to do something to help them,"" said Wang Yongcun, 15, one of the four students. The four boys spent their whole weekend making the change bags. After that they went to see the number of the passengers at each bus stop near their school, and then chose the top six stops to put the bags. Many people think that the four boys have really done a good job. But, things didn't go as the boys thought. Two days later, they found that the money was gone, and that even the bags were taken. It really made them sad but they would not give up. Their classmates and teachers came to help them in time. They put their pocket money in bags again. And the teachers also taught them to make better change bags. They tried their best to do it. The four boys feel very happy because they have done something good for the passengers. Their warm hearts are moving. More and more people are beginning to join in the activity."	['Giving help brings us happiness']
What did Conover find after the first five years of his experiment?	"Fishing is a popular activity and every fisherman knows the rule: Keep the big ones, throw the smaller ones back. The idea behind Lt is simple - the larger fish are probably older. If you keep the smaller ones, they won't be able to reproduce, and the fish population is in danger. But fishing out the largest fish from a population has an unwanted effect: Over time, fewer adult fish get really big. If only the smaller fish reproduce , then future generations become smaller. This is an example of evolution in action. One scientist, Dr David Conover has spent the last decade studying the effects of the ""keep the big ones"" rule and if they can be reversed . To set up his experiment, Conover and his team caught hundreds of silverside fish and divided them into six groups. For two groups, Conover followed the ""keep the large ones"" rule and took out the biggest fish. For two other groups, he removed only the small fish. For the last two groups, he removed fish at random . After five years, he measured the fish in each group. In the two groups where the largest fish were regularly removed, the average fish size was smaller than the average size in the other groups. Here was evolution in action: If only small fish survive to reproduce, then future generations of fish will also tend to be small. For the second five years of his experiment, Conover changed the rules and took fish randomly from each group. At the end of the experiment, he found that the fish that were in the ""keep the large ones"" group for the first five years had started to get larger again, although he calculated it would take at least 12 years for the fish in that group to return to their original size. In other words, it takes less time to shrink than it does to recover."	"['The ""keep the big ones"" rule made fish smaller on average.']"
What is the passage mainly about?	"Gimmicky--and expensive--new gloves allow chatterboxes to take the term 'handsfree' to a new level--by talking into them as they make a call. The gloves are known as 'Talk to the Hand' and costPS1.000 a pair. They come with a speaker unit embedded into the thumb and a microphone built into the little finger that can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth.Artist Sean Miles designed the gloves that double as a phone in part of his project that shows the possibilities of gadget recycling.He combines gloves with parts from mobile handsets recycled through O2,which commissioned the project. Mobile phone users will be able to keep their hands warm while they chat without taking their phone out of their pocket or handbag. Mr Miles designed two pairs of the new gloves--one in pink and the other in brown and yellow.They will appear in an exhibition this July and visitors will be able to win the gloves.If demand is high,they will then be produced on a larger scale. O2 Recycle,which backs the project,estimates that there are already 70 million unused mobile handsets in the UK.The service pays those who recycle gadgets including phones,MP3 players and digital cameras. Designer Scan Miles,hopes his work will get people thinking about recycling.The 41-year-old said:""I hope that my Talk to the Hand project will get people to think again about the waste created by not recycling gadgets.If a few more people recycle their gadgets rather than send them to landfill ,I think this project will have fulfilled its aim."" The Talk to the Hand mobile phone gloves are the second product in a series that O2 Recycle and Miles have created.Miles is now working on combining phones with handbags--so people don't spend time rummaging around in their bags to find a phone when it rings."

The passage mainly tells us that _ .	"Consumers will be digging deeper into their pockets to buy flowers, gift cards and choco lates on Valentine's Day with average spending expected to rise eight percent over last year to nearly $200. And along with their expanding wallets,4 million Americans are expected to propose marriage or receive a proposal on Feb 14. ""We've seen a consistent trend of consumers saying they will spend more,from holiday shopping to 2012 travel plans,and spending plans for Feb 14 are no exception,""said Sonali Chakravorti,vice president at American Express. In its latest spending and savings tracker,American Express questioned 2,000 adults across the United States to gauge(,)how much and on what consumers will be spending their money on Cupid's big day. Nearly half of people said they intend to celebrate at a favori te restaurant, seven percent more than last year.Flowers are still the most popular gift for a Valentine,followed hy gift cards,jewelry and electronics. Among couples getting betrothed ,30 percent said they wou]d propose during a weekend getaway or vacation.To seal the deal,48 percent of people think an engagement ring costing between $1,000 to $5,000 would be appropriatc but 22 percent said up to $2,000 for jewelry would be more realistic,while five percent thought nothing of spending$10,000 or more on a ring. Although nearly 40 percent of women think whoever asked for the date should pay for it,14 Dercent said the bill should be split,but most unmarried men said they would cover the cost of the date. Finances can be a delieate subject,so half of people don't talk about money until they have been together six months and 20 percent of married coupies did not refer to the subject until after they have tied the knot. After marriage money matters can be a cause of disagreements,although the poll showed arguments over household budgets,spending on the children and everyday purchases have declined since last year."

The beautiful hopes will never be destroyed because _ .	Who is there among us who hasn't dreamed of having his or her own small (maybe , several years later , even big )business , and having wonderful freedom , both from a boss and from the time clock ; the freedom to make up our own rules for our work , and our own plans --arranging our own hours of work ? That way work would be both painless and fun. Or, so we imagine. Well, in fact it isn't quite as simple as that. Yes , it is true that being the boss has its satisfactions and that you can arrange your working hours freely if you own your own small business . But in those early years of starting your own business, you shouldn't think of a free day, not to mention flying off for a month's vacation. It is not unusual for new business owners to work seventy or eighty hours a week , and if there is a day off , that day might need to be devoted to accounting . But this negative picture doesn't destroy the beautiful hopes. The possibility of getting something wonderful in return--both material and mental--continues to drive that large number of people who start up small businesses each year in the United States.

From the dialogue between the boy and his mother, we learn that the mother was _ .	"I began working in journalism when I was eight. It was my mother's idea. She wanted me to ""make something"" of myself, and decided I had better start young if I was to have any chance of keeping up with the competition. With my load of magazines I headed toward Belleville Avenue. The crowds were there. There were two gas stations on the corner of Belleville and Union. For several hours I made myself highly visible, making sure everyone could see me and the heavy black letters on the bag that said THE SATURDAY EVENING POST. When it was suppertime, I walked back home. "" How many did you sell, my boy?"" my mother asked. "" None."" "" Where did you go?"" "" The corner of Belleville and Union Avenues."" "" What did you do?"" "" Stood on the corner waiting for somebody to buy a Saturday Evening Post."" "" You just stood there?"" "" Didn't sell a single one."" "" My God, Russell!"" Uncle Allen put in, "" Well, I've decided to take the Post."" I handed him a copy and he paid me a nickel. It was the first nickel I earned. Afterwards my mother taught me how to be a salesman. I would have to ring doorbells, address adults with self-confidence, and persuade them by saying that no one, no matter how poor, could afford to be without the Saturday Evening Post in the home. One day, I told my mother I'd changed my mind. I didn't want to make a success in the magazine business. "" If you think you can change your mind like this,"" she replied, "" you'll become a good-for-nothing."" She insisted that, as soon as school was over, I should start ringing doorbells, selling magazines. Whenever I said no, she would scold me. My mother and I had fought this battle almost as long as I could remember. My mother, dissatisfied with my father's plain workman's life, determined that I would not grow up like him and his people. But never did she expect that, forty years later, such a successful journalist as me would go back to her husband's people for true life and love."	['disappointed']
How did the students perform in the experiment?	"You can do it! That's a better way to motivate yourself than saying ""I can do it, "" according to a new study that shows giving yourself advice and encouragement in the second-person before an upcoming task may actually improve your performance more than first-person self-talk. ""People are used to receiving and giving advice in the second-person, and they seem to prefer using the second-person pronoun to encourage themselves,"" says study co-author, Dr. Sanda Dolcos, a researcher at the University of Illinois. ""Self-advice expressed using 'You' probably enables people to have a broader perspective , consider how others might view the event, and reproduce the kind of encouragements previously received from others."" For the study, Dr. Dolcos and her colleague, Dr. Dolores, asked 143 undergraduate students to write down advice to themselves before completing a series of puzzles. Half of the students were asked to use the first-person, while the others wrote in the second-person. What did the researchers find? The students who wrote in the second-person managed to complete more puzzles and appeared to have a more positive attitude. The researchers also asked the students to write down advice to themselves in relation to exercising more often in the next two weeks. Those who wrote in the second-person, again, reported a more positive attitude toward the task and even planned to do more exercise than the students who referred to themselves in the first-person. ""We were not surprised and had previous research showing that people _ use 'You' in situations that require high levels of self-control and action,"" Dolcos said. But why did the researchers ask students to write down their self-talk instead of saying it out loud? "" Writing as a tool of conversing with oneself has long been used as a therapeutical approach,"" Dolcos explained. ""However, further research is needed to determine which form of self-advice, written or spoken, is more beneficial."""

All of the following made a contribution to the invention and use of contact lenses EXCEPT _ .	"Often we take for granted the many household items we use every day. It is difficult to imagine there was a time in the past when these inventions did not exist. Actually, several of the most common inventions have been with us for quite some time. Inventions like toothbrush, contact lenses , and credit cards came into use long ago. The first toothbrush was introduced in China in the late 1400s but it was only 300 years later that this simple tool came into common use in Europe. By the nineteenth century, a variety of paste and powder cleaners were available throughout Europe as dental care became more widespread. The first tube of toothpaste hit the market in Great Britain in 1891. There is evidence to show that the first contact lenses were actually suggested by an astronomer, Sir John Herschel, in 1827. However, SirJohn Herschel was never able to create a working model of his idea. It was not until 1887 that a Swiss doctor from Zurich, Dr. Eugen Frick, came up with a workable process for producing precision lenses. Dr. Frick designed a new method for producing contact lenses,and the Zeiss factory in Germany began to produce contact lenses. Credit cards have also been available for many years. They have been in use in the United States since the 1920s. At first, these cards were only used to buy gas in the quickly growing automobile service industry. Then, in the 1950s, Diners Club introduced the first general-purpose credit card. Today, credit cards such as Master Card, Visa, and American Express are commonly used by travelers around the world. While it may be true that some of the greatest inventions and discoveries in history came about by chance, the majority of inventions that simplify our lives today came about through careful research and patient study. Of course, it still holds true that even with all the comforts of modern technology, inventors continue to search for ways of helping all of us get out of doing those necessary but tedious tasks which we still face. As the old saying goes, ""Necessity is the mother of invention."""	['Diners Club']
Which kind of hotel can you choose while traveling according to the text?	While traveling, you'll be taking money, license or passport. Or you will buy something expensive to take back home with you and you don't want it to get stolen. Here are some ideas on how to keep your valuables safe while traveling Plan ahead of time Think of what you really need and don't need to take on your trip. Only take the valuables that you must have, not just ones that you would like to have. Carry your valuables on your person Something that is small, like cash and credit cards and your passport, can be carried in a money wallet around your neck or in a money belt. This way, your valuables are hidden and right next to you, where you know where they are at all times. Wear clothing that can hide the money belt. Carry larger valuables in your carry-on bag. If you can't fit it in your money wallet like some large valuables, you'd better put them somewhere that you will keep touch with them. Your can put them on the plane, so you don't have to worry about the airline losing your bag or someone stealing it from the belt after the flight before you get to it. Choose a hotel that has the front desk for valuables. This way, you don't have to worry about housekeeping getting hold of your valuables, or someone stealing your valuables if your room is broken into. If you give the valuables to the front desk to keep for you, choose a time when others are not looking.	['You can choose a hotel with the front desk for valuables.']
How does Laurence explain the influence of peer pressure on teens' behavior?	"Having a teenager at home can be a real headache. Many teenagers smoke, drink and even fight. They often do something dangerous. Earlier studies have shown that teenagers are more likely to make _ decisions than people from any other age group, including children and adults. Is it that teenagers are too young to tell right from wrong? Not really. So what's the reason? According to Laurence, a teacher from a US university, the reason is that teenagers care a lot about how their peers view them--that is ""peer influence"". As children enter their teenage years, they spend more time with their friends and classmates, and also they care more about what they think of them. This makes teenagers make decisions without thinking about the costs. In a test, a group of teenagers were asked to play a video driving game. When they played with their friends watching around them, they took more chances and drove more carelessly because that would increase their possibility of winning. But when they played alone, they drove more safely. Why do peers have such a big influence on teens' behavior? As Laurence sees it, a teenager's brain is like a car with a good accelerator but a weak brake . The ""accelerator"" is fully developed by teenage years while the ""brake"" is still not fully developed. When teenagers are watched by their peers, they usually push hard on the accelerator. With their weak brake, it is likely that they are going to end up in an accident. But the good news is that a violent teenager doesn't necessarily become a violent adult. About two-thirds to three-quarters of violent youth grow out of it. ""They get more self-controlled."""	['By comparing it with how a car works.']
What does Alibaba expect to do on Singles' Day?	"Singles' Day, also called Double Eleven, began as a day for unmarried or uncoupled people to celebrate their lives on November 11, 1993.

In Britain, when people are talking, they usually_.	"""When studying foreign speech, don't forget about body language,"" Anne Merritt said. Something as simple as a smile can show friendliness in one culture, embarrassment in another, impatience in a third. Even silence means different things in different places. If you want to avoid making some mistakes when traveling abroad, you should pay attention to the following. Touch Britain, along with much of Northern Europe and the Far East, has a ""non-contact"" culture. In those countries, there is very little physical contact in people's daily talks. Even brushing someone's arm by accident is the reason for an apology. However, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of daily life. What's more, there are different standards for who touches whom and where. In much of the Arab world, men hold hands and kiss each other in greeting, but would never do the same with a woman. In Thailand and Laos, it is taboo to touch anyone's head, even children's. In South Korea, elders can touch younger people with force when trying to get through a crowd, but younger people can't do the same. Eye contact In most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness . We may think that a conversation partner who looks away is either not listening to us or lying. Of course, this is not the standard around the world. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the unbroken eye contact would be considered impolite and rude. These cultures consider avoiding eye contact a sign of respect for bosses and elders. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees look at their bosses."	['avoid physical contact']

Nobel wanted to set up the Nobel Peace Prize because _ .	Most of us know about the Nobel Prize, especially the Nobel Peace Prize, but few of us know anything about the man who set them up. His name was Alfred Nobel. He was a great scientist and inventor himself. Besides, he had a big business. His business may surprise you. He made and sold explosives . His companies even made and sold weapons. Isn't this something that surprises you? The man who made money from weapons should set up the Peace Prize? Though Alfred Nobel had a lot of money from weapons, he hated war. He hoped that there would be no war in the world. He was one of the richest in Europe. When he died in 1896, he left behind him a lot of money and his famous will. According to his will, most of his money was placed in a fund . He wanted the interest from the fund to be used as prizes every year. We know them as the Nobel Prizes. The Nobel Prizes are international. Alfred Nobel wanted the winners to be chosen for their work, not the country they came from. Alfred Nobel had given his whole life to his studies and work and to the benefits of mankind. He made money all by his own efforts, but he left the world share his wealth. His inventions and wealth stay with the world for ever.	['he hated war']
It can be inferred from this passage that _ .	"""I drink caffeine to stay awake. It has positive effects on me. I'm healthy, and there's nothing wrong with me,"" said Sarah Green, a freshman, who consumes many caffeine drinks to stay awake in completing the many tasks in her busy schedule. Caffeine is known to have many positive and negative consequences, and now that there might be an additional positive effect may have been discovered. A study suggests that a skin lotion containing caffeine, which is also found in green tea, may reduce the risk of skin cancer. Two lotion tests were conducted on hairless mice that were exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation . As a result, the lotion reduced the number of tumors each mouse developed. Unlike sunscreen , the new lotion is applied after exposure to the ultraviolet rays. Rays from the sun can cause genetic changes in the skin that can lead to skin cancer. Caffeine obstructs this action and causes the diseased cells to kill themselves. ""I know that caffeine has been found in certain drinks and it causes increased activity of the nervous system, and increased blood pressure on blood vessels . I don't know of any positive effects of caffeine,"" health teacher Montego Estes said. Caffeine, found commonly in tea, coffee and soft drinks, provides people with an increase in energy. Half of all American adults consume more than 300 milligrams of caffeine per day. Caffeine is addictive because it uses the same mechanisms as amphetamines , and cocaine and heroin to excite the brain. ""This new cream doesn't sound to me as though it would work,"" junior David Bobbit said, ""Caffeine seems to have more negative effects than positive ones."" Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers in the US. About one million cases will be diagnosed in the country this year. There will be more than 88,000 new cases of melanoma , the disease's deadliest form of skin cancer."	['In a way, the study on caffeine is good news for many Americans']
In America, the driver's course mentioned above	"In prefix = st1 /America, drivers' education is part of high school. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a course in drivers' education. However, unlike other courses, it isn't given during the regular school year. Instead, it is a summer course. The course is divided into two parts: class time for learning the laws and regulations, and driving time for practice. The students study the basic traffic laws they must know to pass the written driving test, which is given to anyone who wants to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to sit behind the steering wheel and practice all kinds of skills that are required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive for a total of six hours. The students are divided into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hours. Thus, each student gets half an hour of driving time per outing. The instructor and the ""driver"" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. The cars for drivers' education are different from other ears. In this kind of car there are two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and the other on the instructor; s side. Thus, if the student driver runs into difficulties, the instructor can take over. This kind of car also has another special feature. On the rear window of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should be more careful because the student driver isn't very experienced. After the student has passed the drivers' education course and reached the proper age to drive, they can go to a designated state office to take the driving test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The student must pass all the three tests in order to get a driver's license. If the student does well in the drivers' education class, he or she will have no problem passing the test with flying color1s and getting licensed."

How many color1s are mentioned in the passage?	What is your favorite color1? Do you like yellow, orange or red? If you do, you must be an optimist, a leader, and an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer gray and blue? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what a psychologist tells us, and we are also told that we don't choose our favorite color1 as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress brings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright color1s make people not only happier but also more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark gray. Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a new shirt or a few color1ful thing. Remember also that you will know your friends and your enemies better when you find out what color1s they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about your character when you choose handkerchiefs or a lampshade.	['10.']
Which of the following is the best title of this passage?	Every year many students went to the college bookstore to purchase the different textbooks that they need for their classes. Little do these students realize that, in doing so, they are throwing good money away. It may sound unbelievable but textbooks, in some cases, actually cost as much as, if not more than, college fees. Many people think that college bookstores are the most convenient source for textbooks. Titles are usually kept and students may purchase new textbooks or choose to buy second-hand books and save money. But the money saved by purchasing second-hand textbooks from college bookstores is small compared to the amount they could save by shopping online. More and more online booksellers have begun selling textbooks at heavily discounted prices. Online second-hand bookstores are another source for college books as they keep a large number of textbooks, which means sizable savings for students. Students should avoid purchasing their textbooks at the first store that they surf online since there are so many 'unreal' booksellers on the Net. Price isn't the only factor to consider when making an online purchase. Students should also consider shopping costs and delivery time when making their decision. Online auctions are another option for students seeking a bargain. This option, however, has its _ . A plus is that students can get incredibly cheap books. One problem is that while online bookstores have a system in place that ensure you receive your order within a reasonable amount of time, with an auction purchase, however, you must depend on the auction seller's timetable. One way that students can really save is by getting books for free. Project Gutenberg is one resource that English majors will find invaluable. Here students can legally download a huge collection of classic novels. In the past students needing help with their studies would often have to spend a lot of money buying expensive study guides. Today that is no longer the case. Cash-strapped students can now visit the website SparkNotes for free downloadable study guides as well as classics.	['Learning to Save on Textbooks']
Which might be the best title for the passage?	You've just come home, after living abroad for a few years. Since you've been away, has this country changed for the better or for the worse? If you've just arrived back in the UK after a fortnight's holiday, small changes have probably surprised you--anything from a local greengrocer suddenly being replaced by a mobile-phone shop to someone in your street moving house. So how have things changed to people coming back to Britain after seven, ten or even 15 years living abroad? What changes in society can they see that the rest of us have hardly noticed--or now take for granted? To find out, we asked some people who recently returned. Debi: When we left, Cheltenham, my home town, was a town of white, middle-class families--all very conservative .The town is now home to many eastern Europeans and lots of Australians, who come here mainly to work in hotels and tourism. There are even several shops only for foreigners. Having been an immigrant myself, I admire people who go overseas to find a job. Maybe if I lived in an inner city where unemployment was high, I'd think differently, but I believe foreign settlers have improved this country because they're more open-minded and often work harder than the natives. Christine: As we flew home over Britain, both of us remarked how green everything looked. But the differences between the place we'd left behind and the one we returned to were brought sharply into focus as soon as we landed. To see policemen with guns in the airport for the first time was frightening -- in Cyprus, they're very relaxed -- and I got pulled over by customs officers just for taking a woolen sweater with some metal-made buttons out of my case in the arrivals hall. Everyone seemed to be on guard. Even the airport car-hire firm wanted a credit card rather than cash because they said their vehicles had been used by bank robbers. But anyway, this is still a green, beautiful country. I just wish more people would appreciate what they've got.	['Back in Britain.']

From the reading we know that Father's Day comes _ .	Each year, we celebrate many holidays here in America. On January 1, we welcome the coming of a new year like many people in other countries. And we have another four holidays on the first day of a month: April Fool's Day, May Day, Friendship Day (Aug.1) and Grandparents Day (Sep. 1). The most important holiday for the young people comes in February. It is Valentine's Day. Lots of boys give red roses to girls as a present. People celebrate some holidays for their family members. We say thanks to our mother in May and celebrate Father's Day in the following month. In November many people return home for Thanksgiving Day, so the whole family can stay together. There are also some interesting holidays for children. For example, Halloween comes at the end of October. Children often play with pumpkin lanterns and put on all kinds of masks. Of course, the most important festival is Christmas. After a year of work and study, people can enjoy a long holiday, eat big meals, and visit family and friends.	['in June']
Why are problem-solving skills important?	"Asia tops the OECD solving skills test QUESTION: Can you quickly learn to set a thermostat ? Don't look down upon such a task. It shows your ability to solve problems in creative ways, said the OECD . The OECD recently gave a problem-solving test to 85,000 students. They were all 15 years old, and from 44 countries. The test give each student four to eight everyday problems to solve. For example, they had to set a thermostat, and find the quickest way to a place. Students from Singapore and South Korea did the best job, said the OECD. They were quick learners, curious and able to solve problems that they were not familiar with. Students from Japan and China were also among the _ groups. They did a better job than those from countries like the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and France. Problem-solving skills are important, said the OECD. ""Today's 15-year-olds with poor problem-solving will become tomorrow's adults struggling to find or keep a good job,"" said Andreas, acting director of Education and Skills at the OECD. ""The world economy no longer pays you for what you know. Google knows everything .The world economy pays you for what you can do with what you know,"" he said."

According to the Dana's design, space junk in her satellite _ .	Satellites play big roles in modern life. Some look downward to monitor environmental conditions on Earth.Others look outward in search of major solar flares that can trouble the transmission of electrical power to homes and businesses. Some spy on our enemies. Others relay communications around the globe. But all of these million-dollar wonders of technology can be knocked out by a collision with space junk ---debris ( )from satellites and other earthly technology orbiting high above the planet. Now,a teen from Jordan has designed a satellite to chase down space junk , collect it and then deal with it. Even bits of space junk as small as dots of paint pose a threat , says Dana. That's because this debris orbits our planet at speeds up to some 28,200 kilometers per hour. Such high speed explains why tiny paint dots have damaged the windshields of space shuttles so badly that they needed to be replaced. Researchers have come up with many ideas for getting rid of space junk. Some have suggested vaporizing small bits with lasers. Others have proposed launching satellites to collect the debris. Dana's design falls into this category. Here's how hers would work : A radar system aboard the satellite would scan and find a piece of space junk.Then,thrusters would change the satellite's orbit so that it could chase down _ . As the satellite closed in on its prey, cameras would keep it on target. At the last minute,a door that leads to a container would open. This container needs to be strong so that it doesn't break apart when the satellite swallows the space junk,Dana explains. Finally,when the trash container was full,it would be lowered toward the earth on a kilometer-long cable and its contents released into the upper atmosphere. There, the space junk would harmlessly burn up just like a meteor does. Meanwhile, her satellite would roll the container back up so that it could collect more trash.

The passage is mainly about _ .	"Elvis Aron Presley, often called ""the king of rock music"", died on August 16th, 1977, at the age of forty-two. He left a great influence on popular music, and millions of fans. During his lifetime, Elvis sold more than four hundred million records. After Presley died, many of his records rose quickly. When Presley died, many _ journeyed to Memphis, Tennessee, Presley's home, to pay their last respects . While most of these fans knew a lot about the songs of Elvis, few of them knew the story of how Elvis had made his first recording. Elvis did not really want to become a recording star. His first record was for his mother. He paid four dollars to a small Memphis recording shop, and recorded two songs. The songs were ""My Happiness"" and ""That's Where Your Heartaches Begin"". Sam Philips, who owned the shop where Elvis made the record, liked Presley's songs. He said he would call him some day. About a year later, Philips did call and asked him to cut a record. This first record had ""Blue Moon of Kentucky"" on one side, and ""That's All Right, Mama"" on the other."	['how Elvis Presley began his career']
Which of the following is TRUE about Psycho and The Birds?	What's Keeping You up at Night? Which film would you like to see on the spookiest day of the year? Well, it's that time of the year again; witches, ghosts, wizards and skeletons are supposed to come out in full force. Yes, Halloween --31st October, the spookiest day of the year is almost here. There are so many things we can do to enjoy this supernatural day--sweets, fancy dress and of course watching scary films. It's the perfect time for family and friends to watch horror films on the TV in the dark and maybe they are so frightened that they may try to find safety behind a sofa! There are thousands of such films to choose from that it's hard for us to make choices. One of the most famous is 1970's release Carrie which may meet your needs perfectly. It's a tale of a girl being bullied at school by young women who live to regret it. If you want to see films showing violence, blood and killing, then The Night of the Ling Dead and Evil Dead will provide more horrorable sights than one person can possibly manage. For Hitchcock fans out there, Halloween is the perfect time to watch two of his best-known movies from the 1960's, Psycho and The Birds. Both have aged unbelievably well and still can keep the viewers on the edge of their seats with their very frightening effects. However, not everyone wants to be frightened on Halloween night. Monsters Inc. is an animation film, set in a land where monsters exist and the strange characters are sure to bring a smile to the kids in the family. Meanwhile, if you want to stay up all night, film series such as The Saw, Nightmare on prefix = st1 /Elm Streetand maybe Harry Potter are sure to keep you seated in the box for hours. So turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy the movies that you have chosen, whether it is unpleasant or spooky. But remember, don't have nightmares!	['They were filmed by Hitchcock.']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	While I lived in Ireland, part of my college course was to work with children with special needs. I was selected to work in a school with children with disabilities . I had a lot of rooms to choose from, but I chose to work in the room that was for children with severe disabilities. They had no speech and most were in a wheelchair. The teacher of that room asked if I would work with a girl who had epilepsy and other brain disabilities. She was 15 years old. The teacher thought that it was an achievement for her to be able to put on her coat all by herself. I saw more in her. She always wanted to put string through the shaped blocks to make a necklace. For the 5 years she was in the school the teachers always tried to help her but always ended up doing all the work. I knew this smart girl could do more and so I encouraged her. She had a thumb which she could not move but I encouraged her so much to try. She got very upset most days and sometimes I wanted to give up. Finally after a week this young girl was able to do what she had been wanting to do by herself for so many years. Her teacher cried when she saw what this girl was able to do with just some encouragement. I wish everyone would encourage people rather than tell them they can't or do it for them.	['the writer was willing to take on big challenges']
The passage is most likely to be found in _ .	I can't think of a better way of appreciating a new culture than by taking part in one of its festivals. You'll find that some festivals are celebrated by an entire country, while others may be known only to a single city or region, but either way festivals play an important role in a certain culture. Just enjoy them! Tomatina -- Bunol, Spain Every last Wednesday in August, the town of Bunol is filled with tons of tomatoes in the world's biggest food flight. Many people wear goggles during this hour of great fun, as the town becomes a red river. Boryeong Mud Festival -- Boryeong, South Korea For two weeks in July, millions gather in Boryeong to experience the grey pools and slides. What began as a way to help sell the region's mineral-rich mud has turned into a festive party with music and fireworks. The mud is usually only available in cosmetic products , but here you can cake yourself in grey as you want. Holi -- India Holi, the Festival of Colors, is a Hindu celebration full of joy and one of India's most important holidays. During the day of the last full moon of the lunar month, usually late February or early March, the air is full of brightly colored powder . The festival is celebrated differently throughout the country, with bonfires and music, but the cheerful spirit is common among Hindu people around the world. International Pillow Fight Day -- Worldwide Tens of thousands of people took part in the 4th annual International Pillow Fight Day on April 2, 2013. From London to Vancouver to many other cities, the festival is held in more than 100 countries. So just bring a soft pillow in early April, and watch feathers fly.	['a travel magazine']
Which of the following shares the same theme with The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian?	To honor the best books for young adults and children, TIME has created this list of classics: Best Young-Adult and Children's Books. The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian Sherman Alexie's coming-of-age novel shows family and traditions through young Arnold Spirit, torn between his life in an Indian community and his largely white high school. The specifics are sharply drawn, but this novel, with its themes of self-discovery, speaks to young readers everywhere. Harry Potter What more can be said about J. K. Rowling's unique series? How about this: seven years after the final book was published, readers young and old still go crazy at the slightest rumor of a new Potter story. The Book Thief For many young readers, Markus Zusak's novel provides their first in-depth reflection of the Holocaust . Although terror surrounds Liesel, a young German girl, so too does evidence of friendship, love and charity -- recovering lights in the darkness. A Wrinkle in Time Madeleine L'Engle's super-realist adventure has provided generations of children with their first-ever exciting experiences, as Meg travels across the fifth dimension in search of her father. But the science fiction also has a message: Meg learns independence and bravery in the process. Charlotte's Web Readers are still drawn to the simplicity and beauty of spider Charlotte's devotion to her pig friend Wilbur. Though family farms may be less common than they were in 1952, E. B. White's novel remains timeless for its lasting reflection on the power of friendship and of good writing. Holes Louis Sachar's story of a family curse , fancy sports shoes and poisonous lizards moves forward and backward through time, telling of how Stanley Yelnats IV ended up in a prison camp. It's an introduction to a complex story, filled with fun, warmth and a truly memorable criminal. Matilda With apologies to the lovable Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this may be Roald Dahl's most inspiring book for young people. Poor Matilda feels troubled and ignored by her family -- a sense that many preteens share. They don't share her supernatural powers, but that's the lasting appeal of this escapist fun. The Outsiders Published when author S. E. Hinton was just 18, this coming-of-age novel offers evidence that even the youngest writer can provide valuable wisdom. Her striking look at Ponyboy and gang life in the 1960s has continued to have a powerful effect for decades on readers of all kinds, whether they identify more with the Greasers or the Socs. The Phantom Tollbooth In a humorous, sharp fairy tale that shows language and mathematics through a story of adventure in the Kingdom of Wisdom, Jules Feiffer's unusual drawings do as much as Norton Juster's plain language combined with complex ideas to carry readers through Digitopolis and the Mountains of Ignorance. The Giver Lois Lowry's tale of self-discovery in society has a memorable central character, Jonas, and an unforgettable message -- that pain and harm have an important place in individual lives and in society, and to forget them is to lose what makes us human.

According to the text, different things live on _ .	"When do you think of a forest, what do you see? Just trees? Or do you see many other things, such as singing birds, colorful plants and wild flowers? The forest is a whole world of its own. It is full of many different living things . But even though they are all different, they have one thing in common: they all need each other in order to live on .The trees feed the forest ""people"" by making food in their leaves; by using sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil and air. Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it. Human beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others. We also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone. Life is a matter of giving and taking. We need to help other people as much as we need other people to help us. Think what a good feeling you have when you have done something for someone else. You know, being a volunteer is so great! ,."	['each other']
What can the GooBall do?	"Today in schools, it's not unusual for students to sit in the same kind of desks in the same kind of classrooms as their parents did. Schools have made progress by making use of computers and PDAs in the classroom, yet one design company believes that changes are needed, so they describe what a future classroom may look like. ""Kids are being taught to sit at these wooden desks that are basically designed for writing,"" said Mark Dziersk, the senior vice president of the design. ""They're being lectured in a structured environment."" The solution is a ""customizable education system"" called Gooru that reorganizes the classroom and replaces books, desks, pens, and so on. The three-part technology system consists of an interactive PDA called the GooBall, a backpack and a removable LCD screen for each student. Students can sit, stand or lie down when using the devices, and are not limited to desks. The idea was presented at last month's South by Southwest Interactive Conference. While some educators think the idea is interesting, they doubt whether schools will pay for the expensive and complicated system. The GooBall is an interactive communication device with six layers of learning software. The device monitors a student's heart rate and body temperature and uses GPS to track where they are. It includes instant messaging, a compass, a watch, and a topic-specific alert system that directs a student to related articles and books about whatever they are studying. Students can also choose an animal icon to show their personality. The backpack houses the main power supply for the system and holds some personal items. The pocket keeps items locked tight with a fingerprint security zipper. The portable screen functions like a laptop, providing wireless Internet access and streaming video. It also has a touch screen interface. ""I think it's an excellent idea,"" said Gary Tankard, a sixth-grader who has seen the prototype . ""I'm sure that 90 percent of kids would really like to have it."""	"[""It tests a student's physical condition.""]"
How many people went swimming that day?	It was a very hot afternoon,and we decided to cool off in the river near my home.As we climbed down a small rocky hill toward the water, my boyfriend John suddenly started to shout,then jumped into the water below. Peter and Mary quickly followed but I was too far away to jump. I was strapped. I heard a low hum , which was growing louder .From a distance,the group of bees looked almost like a cloud of smoke.As it got closer,I realized it was actually thousands of bees flying towards me. All I could do was cover my face with hands.Crazily I thought that if I sat very still( ),the bees would think I was just another rock. After a few seconds,I knew my plan hadn't worked.The bees were attacking me. I could hear my friends shouting at me to get down to the pool fast. But it wasn't easy.I was in great pain and the only way I could get away was to use my hands to climb down to the rocks.However, I was afraid to do that at first because my face would be unprotected.The noise the bees made was so loud and frightening ,but I had no choice. I rushed down the rocks and jumped into the pool,but I don't remember doing it.I was just so happy to be free from the pain. I was safe,and the water felt wonderful. But we still weren't out of danger. Every time we tried to climb out of the pool,the bees flew back over our heads.We spent the next three hours in the water, putting our heads under the water from time to time to avoid the bees until they finally lost interest.

Some people are against the nationa1 education standards because _	Americans are thinking about national education standards recently developed by teachers and other education experts. The National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) led the effort. The United States, unlike other nations, has never had the same school standards across the country. What is the reason? Education is not discussed in the Constitution. That document limits the responsibilities of the federal government. Other responsibilities, like education, fall to each state. Local control of education probably was a good idea two hundred years ago. People stayed in the same place and schools knew what students needed to learn. But today, people move to different cities. And some people work at jobs that did not exist even twenty years ago. Many American educators say that getting a good education should not depend on where you live. They say that some states have lowered their standards in order to increase student scores on tests required by the No Child Left behind Act. Kara Schlosser is communications director for the CCSSO. She says the new standards clearly state what a student should be able to do to be successful in college and work. Forty--eight states have already shown approval for the standards. Two states refuse to accept the idea. Critics say that working toward the same standards in every state will not guarantee excellence for all. Some educators in Massachusetts say adopting the national standards will hurt their students because the state standards are even higher. Others say the change will be too costly, requiring new textbooks and different kinds of training for teachers. Still others fear federal control. Supporters say the standards are goals and do not tell states or teachers how to teach. They also say the federal government is not forcing acceptance. However, approving the standards will help states qualify for some federal grant money.	['the standards may prevent some students gaining excellence']
What book is this passage most likely taken from?	"In many ways, the earliest periods of photography are the most satisfying. Learning to use the controls is easy and comes quickly, and you can measure the results in terms of sharp and correctly developed pictures. Once you have mastered that, you can start on the second step of your photographic work. Using these basic skills in a wide variety of situations to give the pictures you want, noticing what you see through the viewfinder and turning that into the most effective picture becomes totally interesting. All good photographs have one thing in common; there is no doubt what the subject of the picture is meant to be. Every photographer must use those same standards to his or her work, not only to the finished results but to the subject before he or she takes it. Always work out quite clearly what the subject of the picture is to be and why you are taking the picture. For example,""I am going to take a picture of this street to show the different styles and ages of the buildings and that people have been living, working and shopping in them since time began.""By doing this you have a better idea of what to include in the picture and what to leave out. How often have you been shown photographs taken by people away on a trip somewhere? The judgment is always similar, something about""the car park is out of the picture to the left"", or""you can't quite see from this picture but if you go up the street"". The photographs are usually collections of buildings, people, parked cars, possibly a distant look of an ancient church, and best of all, a figure which you are told is Aunt Henrietta, disappearing in the middle distance. When photographers show you their pictures, they have a clear idea of what they want to bring to your attention, but it often does not appear in the picture. If they had given just a little of their time to think about their future judgment before taking the picture, then the picture would relate its own story. Good pictures can show their subjects quickly and easily."	['A book on improving photographic techniques.']
In teaching yourself, the first thing you must do is _ .	Students learn their lessons in class. In class teachers teach them. Students sit in the classroom listening to the teacher. This is a way of learning. Is this the only way for students to learn something? Of course not. There is another way to learn: students can teach themselves. For example, if you can't remember something when you are doing your homework, you can look at your book to find the answer. This is a way to teach yourself. And it is not a difficult thing. We can do this at any place and at any time. How do you teach yourself? The first thing you must do is reading. Read something you are interested in. or you have to read. The second is that you must ask yourself questions. The question is something you don't understand, or you want to know more about. You can write down these questions. A clever student is usually good at asking questions. The third is to answer the question yourself by thinking hard, by reading the passage or other books, and sometimes by asking other people. This is the way of teaching yourself. And you must do this all by yourself. If you keep doing like for a long time, you are sure to succeed in your study.	['reading']
Air pollution is the most serious kind of pollution because .	The world itself is becoming much smaller by using modern traffic and modern communication means . Life today is much easier than it was hundreds of years ago, but it has brought new problems. One of the biggest is pollution. To pollute means to make things dirty. Pollution comes in many ways. We see it, smell it, drink it and even hear it. Man has been polluting the earth. The more people, the more pollution. Many years ago, the problem was not so serious because there were not so many people. When the land was used up or the river was dirty in a place, men moved to another place. But this is no longer true. Man is now slowly polluting the whole world. Air pollution is still the most serious. It's bad to all living things in the world, but it is not only one kind of pollution. Water pollution kills fish and pollutes drinking water. Noise pollution makes us become angry more easily. Many countries are making rules to fight against pollution. They stop the people from burning coal in houses and factories in the city, and from blowing dirty smoke into the air. The pollution of SO2 is now the most dangerous problem of air pollution. It is mostly caused by heavy traffic. It is certain that if there are fewer people driving, there will be less air pollution. The earth is our home. We must take care of it. That means keeping the land, water and air clean. And we must try to control the growth of population at the same time.	"[""it's bad to all living things in the world""]"
What did Gershwin do during his stay in Paris?	George Gershwin, born in 1998, was one of America's greatest composers. He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written.

In order to use eyes to operate their mobile phones, most users should buy _ .	"In the near future, we may be using our eyes to operate our smartphones and tablets, even when it comes to playing popular games like Fruit Ninja. The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years. But those devices have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive. ""After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,"" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, ""where everybody would have this available."" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works by sending an infrared light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor . A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices. Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users. ""Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,"" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. ""So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of being a special solution."""	['a replaceable filter']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"Mike was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always happy and always had something interesting to say. If someone asked him how he was doing, he would reply, ""Couldn't be better!"" He was really a care-free young man and never felt tired. Mike used to say, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 'Mike, you have two choices today. You can choose to be happy or you can choose to be upset.' I choose to be happy. Each time something happens, I am always ready to learn a good lesson. I choose to learn from life."" I tried to understand what he said. Indeed life is all about choices. Every situation is a choice. The bottom line is: You're living your life and you make it either happy or sad. Several years later I had a car accident and my legs were seriously injured. When I was lying on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or choose to die. I chose to live. People like to say, ""Choose the one you love and love the one you choose."" Why not choose the one we love and live happily?"	['The writer was unhappy every day.']

The writer mainly wants to tell us _ .	A study found most people use their smart phones for an hour and 52 minutes a day. Most of this time is taken up with texting, emails and surfing the web, but only around 20 minutes is spent making three calls. The survey of 2,000 people found that social media apps, calculators , calendars and cameras were also seen as particularly important functions. Navigation apps such as Google Maps were popular too - with one in six people admitting they would feel unable to travel around an unfamiliar city without _ . The study also found checking Facebook and taking pictures of others are carried out more frequently than making calls. Also on the list were the calendar to remember appointments and birthdays, mobile banking and the news are apps that make day-to-day life a little easier. Tom Barr said: 'The functions on a mobile phone have developed and improved drastically over the past 10 years. With so many ways to keep in touch nowadays, people are using the functions that are convenient for them. As we get less and less time to ourselves, we need more convenience in our lives and less difficulty. While calling can be more personal, it doesn't always save your time.' Scientists at Rice University wanted to see if the latest mobile technology would be used by the students to improve their learning. But a year later, the researchers concluded that it's not enough to give students the right technology, but said they need guidance about how to use it.

In which part of a magazine can we most probably read this text?	Renault's new Twizy could be the future of motoring ... or at least a big part of it. This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge. Only time will tell if this brave move answers enough problems to find a place in our lives.	['Technology.']
Which of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?	English is a language spoken all around the world. There are more than 42 countries where the majority of the people speak English. Most native speakers of English are found in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand. In total, for more than 375 million people, English is their mother tongue. An equal number of people learn English as a second language. These people will perhaps speak the language of their own country at home with their family, but the language of the government, schools, newspapers and TV is English. However, the number of people who learn English as a foreign language is more than 750 million. Everywhere in the world children go to school to learn English. In China, students learn English at school as a foreign language, except for those in hong Kong, where many people speak English as a first or a second language. In only fifty years, English has developed into the language most widely spoken and used in the world. English is the working language of most international organizations, international trade and tourism. English is also the language of global culture, such as popular music and the Internet. You can listen to English songs on the radio or use English to communicate with people around the world through the Internet. With so many people communicating in English every day, it will become more and more important to have a good knowledge of English.

When did Grandma have the operation to remove the abscess?	"It was the day after Halloween when my grandmother was admitted to the hospital with the worst headache she'd ever had. While posing in our costumes the night before, we knew something was wrong, just not how wrong. Grandma's house was the central gathering place of my family. Sunday lunches, birthday dinners, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas -- all were our traditions, with her as hostess. While my parents were busy running their small business, there were many nights when Grandma fed me and put me to bed in her spare room, until they came to get me. I spent my summers at Grandma's and I went everywhere with her. I couldn't imagine a time when she wouldn't be around me. Then November 1, 1991 began her month-long stay in the hospital--she suffered from a rare infection called nocardia asteroides. After being born in the year of the Great Depression, living through World War II, raising three kids, and being widowed at the age of 48, Grandma never expected to live into her seventies. The infection in her brain seemed to confirm that she wasn't long for this world. But that's not the end of her story. A team of doctors successfully removed the abscess , and Grandma even made it into a local medical journal. Her doctor called her ""the brain lady"". Grandma celebrated her 85thbirthday in March this year. In the almost 23 years since her recovery, she's seen two of her four grandchildren get married and welcomed three great-grandsons. Although they damage something in her house, she loves it when my two boys come over. And while I know they make her day, seeing her love blossom for another generation makes my day too. Happy Grandparents' Day to my amazing grandmother!"	['When she was about 62.']
Which of the following cities moved to the west most?	"The massive magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck the west coast of Chile moved the entire city of Concepcion at least 10 feet to the west, and moved other parts of South America as far apart as the Falkland Islands and Fortaleza, Brazil. These measurements, produced from data gathered by researchers from four universities and several agencies, paint a much clearer picture of the power behind this earthquake, believed to be the fifth-most-powerful since instruments have been available to measure earthquake. Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina moved about 1 inch to the west. And Chile's capital, Santiago, moved about 11 inches to the west-southwest. The cities of Valparaiso and Mendoza, Argentina, northeast of Concepcion, also moved. The quake's epicenter was in a region of South America that's part of the so-called ""ring of fire,"" an area of major seismic stresses which encircles(,) the Pacific Ocean. All along this line, the plates on which the continents move press against each other. Mike Bevis, professor of earth sciences at Ohio State, has led a project since 1993 that has been measuring crustal movement in the Central and Southern Andes. The effort is called the Central and Southern Andes GPS Project, or CAP. Ben Brooks, an associate researcher with the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii, said that the event, offers a unique opportunity to better understand the seismic processes that control earthquakes. ""We now have modern, precise instruments to evaluate this event, and because the site borders a continent, we will be able to get evidences of the changes it caused."" said Brooks."	['Concepcion']
The northeast of Brazil once became rich because of _ .	Before the arrival of Europeans, many Native American tribes lived in Brazil. In 1500 Pedro Alvares Cabral sailed from Lisbon and arrived at Porto Seguro, in Bahia. Brazil got its name from a kind of reddish tree, native to this land, which was sold in Europe. Salvador da Bahia was founded in 1549 and became the capital city of the new Portuguese colony. Portuguese settlers started to produce sugar and the northeast of Brazil became a wealthy corner of the world. During that time, Portugal brought millions of black slaves to work in its sugar refineries . In the 18th century, many Portuguese started to explore the remote areas that were far away from the coastal cities. Gold was discovered in Minas Gerais and Vila Rica became one of the richest cities in the world. In 1763 the Portuguese decided to move Brazil's capital city from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. In the 19th century, when Napoleon invaded Portugal, the royal family moved to Brazil and Rio became the capital city of the Portuguese Empire. When the king returned to Portugal, Brazilians didn't want their land to be a colony anymore and declared their independence in 1822. During that period of time, lots of European immigrants were crossing the ocean to find jobs in the coffee markets. In 1889 Brazil became a Republic. In 1960 Brazilians moved the national government from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia, a modern planned city that was built to be capital of Brazil. Nowadays Brazil is the most powerful country in South America and one of the most important nations in the world. In spite of its growing economy, poverty and many crimes appear which are nothing but far from being solved in the short term.	"[""black slave's hard work""]"
If you want to improve your children's result in school, _ .	"If you want to improve your child's results at school, you could do a lot worse than ensuring that they do plenty of exercise. Scientists have already shown that physical activity can make you brainier. But a team in America has used scans to show that an important part of the brain actually grows in children who are fit. These youngsters tend to be more intelligent and have better memories than those who are inactive. Scientists also found that one of the most important parts of their brains was 12 percent larger than those of unfit children. They believe that encouraging children to take exercise from a very young age could help them do better at school later. Researchers from the University of Illinois, in the U.S., studied the brains of 49 children aged nine and ten using a magnetic resonance imaging scan , a technique which provides very detailed pictures of organs and tissues in the body. They also tested the fitness levels of the children by making them run on a treadmill . The scientists found that the hippocampus, a part of the brain responsible for memory and learning, was around 12 percent larger in the fitter children. Professor Art Kramer, who led the study published in the journal Brain Research, said the findings had important implications for encouraging individuals to take part in sport from a young age. ""We knew that experience and environmental factors and socioeconomic status all impact brain development,"" he said. ""If you get some terrible genes from your parents, you can't really fix that, and it's not easy to do something about your economic status. But here's something that we can do something about."""

There is no real advantage. However, it adopted a unique marketing strategy, and quickly occupied the market as a top ice cream brand. Haagen-Dazs did not set up shops in ordinary supermarkets or grocery stores. Haggen-Dazs leisure fashion shops are located in busy sections of malls. The layout is carefully planned to create an elegant atmosphere, and sometimes, a flagship store will cost several million dollars. Compared to other ice cream brands, Haagen-Dazs consumers are tightly grouped. It is understood that Haagen-Dazs seldom does television advertising. The majority of advertisements are high impact visually in print advertisements. In particular many advertisements target the wealthy consumers. Moreover, if the consumer spends 500 Yuan they can become a member. These members will be regularly sent advertisements by direct mail. Praise of customers is a powerful weapon. There is always much creative ingenuity in Haagen-Dazs advertising, so it is remembered by the people: initial advertisements such as: ""Delicious Haagen-Dazs, like 24K gold, Kobe beef from Japan, original palm oil, mushroom truffles and Chinese ceramics...what 'ice cream'was waiting for."" ""love her, let her eat Haagen-Dazs"" This classic advertisement attracted numerous Haagen-Dazs lovers who became regulars.

What does Stephen Wolfram think about the result of the research?	"An interesting study posted on Facebook recently shows how men and women develop new interests as they mature . While women tend to take exercise seriously from the age of 34, men will wait until their 45th birthdays before working hard to get in shape. The average woman spends more time talking about sports, politics, career and money as she gets older. Women's interest in books reaches its peak at the age of 22, while that of men does so when they are in their 50s. Men start to change their focus from the workplace to other things after age 30, while women do not do so until eight years later. Both, however, care most about fashion at age 16. The research used anonymous data donated by thousands of Facebook users, recording the statuses, 'likes' and 'interests' they had posted on their profiles. It found the average woman talks about television most at 44, while men peak much younger, at age 31. Men are also most likely to see a film in a cinema at age 31, while women go out to see films most when they are only 19. Men are most interested in travel at 29, women at 27, while women talk most about food and drink at 35, and men at 38. And if you are middle aged, a safe topic for any audience is the weather, which is a key interest for many as they approach 60. Stephen Wolfram, the British scientist who carried out the research, says, ""It's almost shocking how much this tells us about the changes of people's typical interests. ""People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics."""	"[""People's interests change greatly with age.""]"

According to the passage, the writer _ .	"I hated every minute of it, digging in the smelly dirt in spring, planting the tiny seeds in rows, and weeding the plants while sweat poured down my face. I wanted to spend the summer with my friends. But instead, I spent every Saturday and my summer vacations working in my mom's large vegetable garden. My mom was determined that l would learn how to plant and harvest a proper garden. I grew up and left home, happy to leave that old vegetable garden behind. But a few years later, living in a little house with my husband, I looked out of the back window and saw a big sunny spot. ""That might be a good place for a vegetable garden,"" I thought, surprising even myself. I could hear Mom's voice in my head ""Put the peas in rows, and the lettuce in bunches. Leave room between the tomatoes and cucumbers so they can spread. Pulling weeds right after it rains is easier."" Over the years, with each new house I've moved to, the first thing I've looked for is room for a garden in the backyard. As a teenager I would complain, sitting down to a table full of fresh vegetables from the garden, but now I exclaim to my own three teens, ""Look at all this food you will never eat something so good and fresh picked from your own backyard!"" Now a third of my small backyard is a vegetable garden, and every year it grows just a bit bigger. When my son Simon was five, his eyes became wide as he helped me pick peas and beans one morning. ""Wow! Mom, we have so much free food!"" So, thanks, Mom, for knowing more than I did, about how much I would love digging in the dirt. Thank you for teaching me when I was unteachable and for somehow sparking an interest that would lead to a lifetime joy."	"[""used to dislike vegetables from Mom's garden""]"
Who was Harry Houdini?	"Harry Houdini(1874--1926) was a world-famous magician and a performer of death-defying stunts . His world fame was based on a series of astonishing escapology tricks. He was able to free himself from obviously escape--proof devices, including leg irons, handcuffs (as many as ten pairs at the same time), locked prison cells and crates which had been nailed shut. His most striking skill was when he escaped from an airtight tank that was filled with water. Houdini was born in Budapapest, prefix = st1 /Hungary, and his family moved to theUSAwhen he was a child. For a time, they lived in a cheap boarding house inNew Yorkand they struggled to make a living. One of Harry's first jobs was an apprentice to a locksmith , which is where he mastered the art of opening locks without using a key. In 1891, Houdini became a professional magician, but at first he met with little success. When he began experimenting with escapology, however, he so impressed a theatre manager who saw him that he was strongly advised to concentrate on that part of his act. Within months, he was a huge success, performing at top theatres, not only in the USAbut also in Europe. He created a sensation inLondon, when he made an elephant disappear from the stage of the Hippodrome Theatre. What the audience didn't know was that below the stage was a swimming pool filled with water, where the somewhat terrified elephant finished up! Back in the USA, he produced the most dangerous act of his career--the Water Torture. He was suspended(,) upside down in a water tank which was full to overflowing. He had to hold his breath for more than three minutes to escape. In a fictionalised film of his life, he ""died"" doing this trick. This is not true. He actually died of peritonitis in a Detroit hospital."	['A famoust American magician']
Which of the following statement is true according to the passage?	"Switching telephone providers used to be the only way homeowners could save money on telephone bills. Now thanks to new technology, comsumers have another choice-making phone calls over the internet. And this can be completely free if you call another person with an internet phone set-up. The technology is called voice over internet protocol , or VoIP. In 2005, consumer demand for VoIP dramatically grew. In the US, where popularity has grown faster than here in the UK, 8.4 million are predicted to subscribe this year. For the past couple years, VoIP pioneers such as Skype have accounted for the majority of internet phone subscribers. VoIP is attractive to consumers because it's cheaper than traditional phone services. With the basic equipment of PC, microphone and headset, and VoIP software and broadband internet for optimum voice quality, consumers can save a fortune chatting for free to other internet phone owners and save money calling regular landlines . But, as the saying goes, . Many of these services suffer from uncontinuous lapses in quality. While some users may tolerate echoes or a dropped call, improved quality is needed to attract more customers. Computing has examined the benefits of using a PC as a telephone with VoIP in how easy they were to set up, how effective they were and the range of their features. Skype(www. skype.com) came top for its bother-free approach, easy set-up and exceptional voice clarity. Sipgate (www. sipgate. co. uk), MSN(www. messenger. msn. co. uk) and Yahoo!

On the whole, the author holds a view towards the search trail that _	"When people search online, they leave a trail that remains stored on the central computers of firms such as Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. Analyzing what we're looking for on the Web can offer a remarkable understanding of our anxieties and enthusiasms. UK writer John Battelle wrote on his blog, ""This can tell us extraordinary things about who we are and what we want as a culture."" Google's experimental service Google Trends, for example, compares the numbers of people searching for different words and phrases from 2004 to the present. According to these graphs, sometimes people's interests are driven obviously by the latest news: when the Spice Girls, a pop group, announce a reunion, there's an immediate rush to find out more about them. Other results are strikingly seasonal: people go shopping online for coats in winter and sandals in summer. The most fascinating possibility is that search data might help predict behavior. Perhaps we search for a political candidate's name when we are thinking about voting for him or her. This information could clearly be useful to a marketer - it's already how Google decides which ads to show on its search results pages - or to a political campaign manager. Marissa Mayer, a Google vice-president, argues that Google Trends correctly ""predicted"" George Bush's victory over John Kerry in the 2004 election. The graph clearly shows that Bush continued his lead over Kerry, in terms of search volumes, even when polls suggested _ . However, that's not always the case. For instance, the same approach predicted Hillary Clinton would beat Barack Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 turned out to be wrong in the end."

When the boy started kissing, the father shouted, ""Oh, Andrew, don't do it now. I'm too busy!"" The boy soon became silent as tears fell down from his big blue eyes. Feeling sorry, the father said, ""You can finish the kisses later ."" The boy said nothing but quietly walked away. That evening the father said, ""Come and finish the kisses now, Andrew!"" But the boy didn't. Unluckily, a few days later, the boy had an accident and died. His sad father wrote,""If only I could tell him how sorry I am for my thoughtless words and how much my heart is hurt."" Love is a two-way street. We must warmly accept any loving acts, or others will take it as a ""No"" and it may leave a scar . If we don't have love, our life will lose its true meaning. If we are too busy to give and receive love, we are too silly! Nothing is more important than loving the people who are important to us."	['sad']
Memorizing the lyrics of songs is mentioned in the text to _ .	Traditionally poems would be recited and passed from poet to poet through the ages. It is only recently that poetry is something that one reads alone, rather than reciting to an audience. At some point in the education of any student majoring in poetry, one will attempt to memorize a poem, and possibly recite it to someone else. Chances are that you have already memorized thousands of lines of verse in the form of lyrics. How did you memorize the lyrics of songs? You simply listened to songs you liked over and over again until you almost couldn't help but have them memorized. Memorizing poetry isn't much different. You start with a poem you like, recite it to yourself over and over again, and you get to know it. One of the best aspects of learning a poem by heart is that you get to take a poem inside of yourself. It becomes a part of you. When you memorize a poem, it is no longer just a poem, but yours. It's in your head, and you can call it up from memory as you would in any other experience. Also, memorizing a poem is a great way to truly get to understand languages, and consider every phrase, line, and word. You can practice varying the sounds, adding pauses and emphasis in different spots to try to find the most accurate tone for the poem. In a way, you never really know a poem until you've memorized it. Once you know it, you'll be able to recite it, like a jazz musician improvising inside a song's boundaries - adding his own words or re-wording a section to make it his own.

What measure has Northgate High School taken to keep girls from wearing short skirts?	"A group of British schools are banning skirts after helplessly watching the fashion of ""hemline _ creep"" when girls roll up skirts to show more of their legs.Rising hemlines among girls in their midtolate teens have long been a headache for schools.Now,it seems,girls who are leaving homes with perfectly proper skirt lengths manage to transform their uniform into microminiskirts by the time they get to school. Some are so short that the headmaster of Tewksbury School in Gloucestershire said they are ""almost like belts"".Obviously,they have become a bit of a distraction for both boys and male teachers. Robert Kelly,headmaster of Berwickshire High School in Scotland,said short skirts could cause ""inappropriate thoughts"" among boys.And Hilary Winter,headmaster of Piggott School in Wargrave,Surrey,described short skirts as a ""difficult distraction for members of staff "". In the town of Ipswich alone three schools have removed skirts from their approved uniform list.David Hutton,headmaster of Northgate High School,said,""Unfortunately,despite getting in touch with specific parents,sending some girls home to change,requiring others to wear a schoolowned skirt for the day and repeatedly asking others to unroll their skirts,we still had some girls coming to school in inappropriate skirts."" ""I have therefore introduced a trousersonly policy,which will enable my staff to focus their time and effort on providing students with the best education possible."" Girls at Nailsea School near Bristol are used to a uniform ban.Two years ago,they were forbidden from wearing trousers made by the clothing brand Miss Sexy,which were reportedly too low on the hips and too tight.""Staff were becoming embarrassed by seeing too much of the girls instead of the uniform,""headmaster David New said.""They were very low, hipsterstyle,very tight trousers."" Now they have been banned from wearing skirts. ""We didn't want to waste any more time on it.It just means that teachers can concentrate on what's important in education,""New said. Megan Throp,a 15yearold student at Guiseley School in Leeds,facing a trousersonly policy,told the Yorkshire Evening Post newspaper,""Our rights and freedom of being young women have been taken away because we have been forced into wearing school trousers."" However,students are likely to find another means of adjusting dress code ,as David New told the LA Times,""I suspect that,teenagers being teenagers,there will be a new uniform violation that becomes the habit,""he said.""That was true when I was at school,and I'm sure it was true when my father was at school."""

According to the passage, we can learn that _ .	What will man be like in the future--in 5,000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make a guess, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller, so we may assume that man will continue to grow taller. Again, as time goes on, we shall have to use our brains more and more. This is likely to bring about a physical change to the head, in particular, the forehead will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we are likely to make less use of our arms and legs, which, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. Perhaps all these give the impression that in the future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same, in spite of all these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us.	['less use of a part of the body will become weaker']

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	Electricity, like clean water, is a resource that's often taken for granted. But last summer, when blackouts struck much of the northeastern US, Ontario and Rome, consumers on two continents were given a painful reminder of just how easily broken electricity supplies can be. The massive disorder stranded commuters, stopped freezers, shut down businesses and refocused attention on where most of the planet's power comes from:oil-and-gas-fired generators and nuclear plants, These sources not only pollute the environment but also make many consumers feel unacceptable health risks. Companies are trying to offer an alternative, clean energy from renewable resources that's plentiful and portable. Lifton's Medis Technologies, as well as companies like Hydrogenics and Nanosys, is tapping into fuel cells and dolor panels to give people power whenever and wherever they want it, free from dependence on local grids . The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity. With the cell phone and gadget market in mind, Medis has developed a fuel cell with cheap components that produces little heat and effortlessly reduces waste water without turning to energy consuming pumps.

Where did the old man live when he was a kid?	"In two days, I will be turning 30. And I was not looking forward to a new decade . I was afraid that the best years of my life were behind me. One day, I met with my friend Nicholas. He was a 79-year-old man. He noticed something was different about me and asked if anything was wrong. I told him what I was anxious about and asked him: ""What was the best time of your life?"" Without hesitation, Nicholas replied: ""Well, Joe, when I was a child in Austria and everything was taken care of for me, that was the best time of my life."" ""When I was going to school and learning the things I know today, that was the best time of my life."" ""When I got my first job and got paid for my work, that was the best time of my life.""

We know mosquitoes very well because _ .	We know the mosquito very well. Mosquitoes fly everywhere. They can be found almost all over the world, and there are more than 2,500 kinds of them. No one likes the mosquito. But the mosquito may decide that she loves you. She? Yes,she. It's true that male mosquito doesn't bite and only the female mosquito bites because she needs blood to lay eggs. She is always looking for things or people she wants to bite. If she likes what she finds, she bites. But if she doesn't like your blood,she will turn to someone else for more delicious blood. Next time a mosquito bites you,just remember you are chosen. You're different from the others! If the mosquito likes you,she lands on your body without letting you know. She bites you so quickly and quietly that you may not feel anything different. After she bites,you will have an itch on your body because she puts something from her mouth together with your blood. By the time the itching begins,and she has flown away. And then what happens? Well,after her delicious dinner,the mosquito feels tired. She just wants to find a place to have a good rest. There,on a leaf or a wall, she begins to lay eggs,hundreds of eggs.

These are the reasons for smog except _ .	"Smog has affected Beijing for at least a week and the Great Hall of the People, where lawmakers will meet next week for the country's parliamentary session , is hardly visible. Much of north and central China, or one-seventh of the country, was covered in it over the weekend. Responses have included reduced industrial activities, a ban on fireworks and barbecues, raised pollution alerts and reduced vehicles travelling on the roads. Citizens are advised to stay indoors while schools have either stopped classes or suspended outdoor activities. And Chinese officials, after a long period of prioritizing economic development over environmental protection, are now likely to see their future career shaped by how effectively they handle the serious pollution. ""Even as a foreigner, I know the pollution has a lot to do with too much focus on economic indicators in evaluating Chinese officials,"" said Florian Kessler, an executive director with German law firm WZR Consulting. The German executive speaks fluent Chinese, loves Beijing food and is a big fan of Beijing Guo'an Football Club, but after staying in the city for eight years, he now wants to leave. ""Since I smoke, I'm okay with the pollution, but I can't let my kid breathe in the polluted air. That's why I'm leaving,"" Kessler explained. He also said that German companies operating in Beijing, such as BMW, Benz and Volkswagen, have all had a hard time finding staff willing to work here. China has repeated in the past that we would not follow the old path of industrialized nations to develop first and deal with pollution afterward. But the smog is an awkward reminder that our country is already on that path. Whether we can change route depends on the choice Chinese officials make between environment and growth in the years ahead."	['outdoor activities']
Why did the farmer help the mother?	"A couple of years ago on a hot summer day in south Florida, a little boy decided to go for a swim in the old swimming hole behind his house. In a hurry to dive into the cool water, he ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks, and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator was swimming toward the shoe. His mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy became worried and made a return to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. From the bank. the mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator _ his legs. That began a tug-of-war between the two. The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother was much too determined to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard her screams, raced from his truck, took aim and shot the alligator. After weeks and weeks in hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were extremely scarred by the attack of the animal and on his arms were deep scratches where his mother's fingernails dug into his flesh in her effort to hang on to the son she loved. The newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy after the injury, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted his pants legs. And then, with obvious pride, he said to the reporter. ""But look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mom wouldn't let go."	"[""He didn't want to see the alligator killing the boy.""]"
which of the following can act as the title of the passage?	"Michael Jackson's personal doctor was found guilty on Tuesday of involuntary manslaughter in the pop star's drug-related death in 2009 - but may not spend much time in jail. Dr. Conrad Murray, 58, was led away in handcuffs after the jury in Los Angeles convicted him guilty. Dozens of fans outside the court erupted in cheers and some burst into tears. ""Justice was served. Michael is with us,"" said Jackson's brother Jermaine. Murray faces up to four years behind bars when he was sentenced on November 29 but may spend only months in LA's overcrowded prisons. Murray did not admit guilty for giving the ""Thriller"" singer a fatal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol - normally used in surgery that ruled the main cause of his death at the age of 50.. The judge ordered Murray, who had been free on bail for two years, held in prison until his sentencing. The doctor did not speak at the six-week trial. Jackson's mother Katherine and sister Rebbie cried silently at the result. Other family members in court included his siblings La Toya and Randy, along with his father Joe. I am,"" Katherine Jackson said when reporters asked if she was pleased. Murray admitted giving Jackson a small dose of propofol to help him sleep. but his lawyers argued the singer was dependent on the drug and likely gave himself an extra fatal dose and swallowed a handful of sedatives without Murray's knowing. Prosecutors said Murray was to blame for administering the drug in a home setting, failing to monitor Jackson, delaying a call to emergency services and failing to tell medical personnel he gave the singer propofol. Judge Michael Pastor said Murray was ""now a convicted person who has been considered the causative factor in Michael Jackson's death."" Pastor said the doctor should be imprisoned before being sentenced to protect public safety."	"[""Michael Jackson's Doctor Guilty of Manslaughter""]"
What Kenneth J. Sher says suggests that _ .	"A four-year study of 200 college students found that those who drink heavily and started drinking at an early age demonstrate poor decision-making skills, just like long-term, chronic alcoholics. Researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia believe early onset binge drinking negatively affects psychological development. The researches examined college students between the ages of 18 and 22. After three years, they tested them using the Iowa Gambling Test, which measures the tendency to make immediate (disadvantageous) or long-term (advantageous) choices. Based on the students' reported drinking habits, they were grouped into four categories: low binge drinkers, moderate binge drinkers, increasing binge drinkers and stable or high binge drinkers. ""Students in the stable or high alcohol use category, who had longer histories of binge drinking, made riskier and less advantageous choices, which reflect problems associated with planning for the future,"" the researchers reported. The study also found that only students who started binge drinking when they were younger showed impairment on the task. ""There is reason to think that heavy binge drinking during adolescence, when the brain is still rapidly developing, may have some negative legacy on psychological development,"" said Kenneth J. Sher of MU's Midwest Alcoholism Research Center in a news release. ""The interesting thing is that if we were to just look at binge drinkers and how impaired they are in the decision-making process as juniors, we'd really be obscuring the important issue, which is how long they've been binge drinkers and / or how early they started."""

Which of the following is NOT true of Charlie Kitchin's words?	"""It's this time of year when the weather starts warming up and frogs start breeding - but they haven't been breeding,"" says John Wilkinson, research and monitoring officer at the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust (ARC). Amphibians are just one of the groups of animals that nature observers fear may have problems reproducing this year, as groundwater levels are even lower now than in the infamously dry summer of 1976, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). According to the UK's Centre for Hydrology and Ecology the average rainfall so far this winter has been the lowest since 1972. ""If ponds dry up totally,"" says Mr. Wilkinson, ""you could have lots of dead tadpoles."" Drier and windier conditions could also make it more difficult for juvenile amphibians to survive their journeys between wet habitats. But Peter Brotherton, the biodiversity manager for Natural England, says that ""drought is part of nature's cycle"", and, at present, a lot of animals, plants and insects are still in hibernation. This means that the population picture is unclear. ""However, when we get extreme events, we get animals dying,"" he says. ""And what is worrying is that normally at this time of year we expect soil to be near saturation after winter."" Charlie Kitchin, the RSPB's site manager of the Nene Washes in Cambridgeshire, says the 2,000-acre wetland and grassland area is now struggling following two winters with relatively little winter rain and no flooding. One species that could suffer, he says, is the black-tailed godwit . ""There are only 50 breeding pairs in the country, and we have 40 of them, and everything is bone-dry,"" Mr Kitchin says. But one bad nesting season, he says, is ""not the end of the world"". ""One of the features of flood plains is that they're _ anyway,"" he adds. ""But if they fail to breed another year, the population is likely to dip again."""	['40 black-tailed godwits live in the Nene Washes.']
Alfred the Great was the king of _ .	England became England, the land of English-speaking people, at the beginning of the Middle Ages. Before that it had been the home of Iron Age tribes known as Celts, and for a time, part of the Roman Empire. Then beginning in the 400s AD, tribes from the north, known as the Engles, the Saxons, and the Jutes, moved in. The most famous leader of this time period in England was Alfred the Great. Alfred lived in Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, which was in the southern part of England. He was a good leader who made his kingdom stronger. He created a system of defenses , called burhs, across the country. He reorganized the army so that his men had time to fight and time to farm. Alfred's efforts protected his people from the Vikings and allowed Wessex to grow. Eventually the rulers of Wessex would rule all of England. Alfred also made other improvements. He made laws for his people. He encouraged learning and translated several important books into his Saxon language. This was the beginning of the language we call English today. Two important pieces of literature from that time period are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Beowulf, both written in Old English. Old English lasted through most of the Middle Ages. Middle English came in during the late Middle Ages, and Modern English began about the time of the Renaissance. England and English got their names, not from the Saxons, but from one of the other tribes, and Angles. The original name of England must have been something like Angle-land(only in old English of course).	['the West Saxons']
The author thinks he will have a difficult August because _ .	"August has always been difficult for me. It is the time when I realize that the books my English teacher assigned to me are not going to read themselves and that I have a difficult month in front of me. You might think that I don't want to spend my summer reading, but that's not the problem: I love reading. On the first day of my summer holidays this year, I went to the library and got ""A Gathering of Old Men"" by African-American writer Ernest Gaines. I enjoyed it very much. I read all the magazines that my parents subscribe to and spend about 30 minutes every day with the morning paper. So why do I hate summer reading for school? Because the books on summer reading lists are often slow-going and just uninviting. Teachers and librarians don't understand that summer reading can be entertaining as well as educational. They choose books that a friend of my mother's calls ""spinach books"": good for you, but not much fun to take in. Every summer, I read them, hate them and get bitter about the experience. This bitterness started three years ago when I was about to begin high school. As preparation, my English teacher told me to read ""The Age of Innocence"" by American author Edith Wharton. I'm sure there are many people who enjoyed ""The Age of Innocence""--some might even say it's their favorite book. But I don't think any of these people read it as a 14-year-old boy on his summer vacation. ""The Age of Innocence"" is the story of a forbidden romance in prefix = st1 /New York100 years ago. At 14, my only experience with romance was my love for baseball. I couldn't imagine being in love, much less being in love in 1900. ""The Age of Innocence"" was totally different to my life. Most of my required summer reading has been like that--books written in a style that plays up the adjectives and plays down the verbs. I guess teachers don't think exciting plots make for ""good literature"". To me, though, a good writer describes events and characters in a way that makes the reader want to know what happens next. If I were making up a summer reading list, it would include ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" by George V. Higgins, ""The Right Stuff"" by Tom Wolfe, and ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer. These are all books that have literary value but, just as important, can also entertain kids on vacation. If the teachers could stand a little fun in the books they assign, my Augusts would be a lot more enjoyable."	['he is to read the books boring and not right for kids']
All the following are the causes of the head and neck cancer EXCEPT _ .	"New research is strengthening evidence that eating vegetables may be some of the best health advice. A study of 500, 000 Americans has found that just one extra serving of fruit or vegetables a day may reduce the risk of developing head and neck cancer. Many studies have shown that diet plays a role in cancer. Cancer experts now believe that up to two-thirds of all cancers come from lifestyle such as smoking, diet and lack of exercise. Tobacco and alcohol use increases the risk of head and neck cancer, which affects the mouth, nose, sinuses and throat. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute asked men and women aged 50 and older about their diets, then followed them for five years to record all diagnoses of head and neck cancer, the sixth-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The study found eating six servings of fruit and vegetables per day per 1, 000 calories cut the risk of head and neck cancer by 29 percent compared to eating one and a half servings. An adult needs around 2, 000 calories a day. ""One more serving of fruit or vegetables per 1, 000 calories per day reduced head and neck cancer risk by 6 percent,""said Neal Freedman, a cancer prevention fellow at the NCI. A second study in 183, 000 people of California and Hawaii found a diet high in flavonols might help reduce pancreatic cancer risk, especially in smokers. Flavonols are common in plants but highest in onions, apples, berries, kale and broccoli. The study found that people who ate the most flavonols reduced risk of developing pancreatic cancer by 23 percent than those who ate the least."	['smoking']

The best word to describe the way of realizing the travel dream is _ .	To travel around the world is the dream of many adventurous people. But very few people can afford a global tour because hotels, food and airplane tickets are too expensive. Some people, however, have thought of some ways to realize their dreams. Laura Cody and Tanbay Theune, a couple from Britain, decided to travel around the world. They have found a good way to pay for their trips. They look after pets for rich house owners. In exchange, they can stay in the houses for free. They have looked after horses, cows, cats, dogs and fish. In two years, the couple has been to Australia, Germany, Spain and Italy. They have stayed in big cities and small villages. The home owners are usually very generous and have given them food, wine and day trips. Another person who tries to realize her travel dream is photographer Rhiannon Taylor. She travels around the world to visit, review and take photos of the best hotels. She shares the places she stays in and the food she eats on the Internet with tens of thousands of followers. With these ways of making money, traveling around the world is no longer a dream. More and more young people are thinking creatively to make their dream come true.	['creative']
What can we infer from the passage?	Humans have observed and explored the oceans since ancient times.But it wasn't until the 19th century that the scientific study of oceans began.The first major scientific expedition,and the one that firmly established the field of oceanography,was the around-the-world voyage of H.M.S. Challenger.Setting out from England in 1872,the Challenger spent almost three and a half years gathering a wealth of information about seawater,sea life,and the ocean floor.Major oceanographic expeditions since then have included the South Atlantic voyage of the German ship Meteor in 1926 and the Deep-Sea Drilling Project from 1968 to 1983.Many individuals also have played important roles in advancing our understanding of oceans,beginning with Matthew Fontaine Maury in the mid-1800s;his work on oceanography and navigation led to a uniform system of weather reporting at sea.Since Maury's time,oceanography has progressed rapidly.Early oceanographers had to contend themselves with tossing buckets overboard to see what they might haul in.Today's oceanographers are equipped with space images,supercomputer models,and deep-sea robots that can crawl along the seafloor.As they set goals for the future,some oceanographers even dream of doing research in permanently manned stations on the bottom of the oceans.	['The expeditions in the past had great difficulty and made a lot of efforts in order to study the oceans.']
What is the main idea of this passage?	"It is commonly known that Japan went from a 19th century national economy to a 20th century global economy in a time span of 30 years between 1945 and 1975. What is less known is that Japan, understanding that fast, efficient transport was the key to a global economy, was the first country in the world to introduce the ""Bullet Train"". Kawasaki Heavy Industries was duly appointed the manufacturer and the first high speed train went ""on line"" in 1964. The Shinkansen, as is known in Japan, made its first journey between her capital and Osaka, a distance of 301 miles, at a speed of 132 mph. The next country to introduce high speed trains was France. SNGF, the public rail system in France, was losing passengers to other forms of transport and introduced the ""TGV"" (Train a Grande Vitesse) to counteract the trend in 1981. As a result of Opec controlling the oil market in 1974, the train was designed to be powered by gas turbines. It ran on a specially built track between Lyon and Paris. Eight years later another TGV was introduced, this time between the coast and Paris. Soon, France became the most rail efficient country in the world with high speed train connections to Belgium, London, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands. There was another positive element that resulted from the introduction of high speed trains. Between 1964 and 1991, Japan's Shinkansen had transported in excess of three billion passengers without there being a single fatal accident and eleven years after France introduced the TGV, it still had a 100% safety record. This statistic has never been equaled by the traditional slow moving trains in any country. China has become the fourth country to produce such trains, after France, Germany and Japan. China's first domestically produced bullet train with a maximum speed of 350 kilometers per hour has rolled off the production line. Equipped with highly-efficient power system, the currently fastest train in China is also energy efficient. When the train is running, it can transfer kinetic energy into electricity, so that it can ensure its electricity supply even when it is cut off from the power grids. In all, such trains are expected to be in commercial operation by the end of 2010."	['Bullet trains have many advantages and are accepted by more and more countries.']
British parents, as the writer described in this passage, _ .	"LONDON--Life for Cathy Hagner and her three children is set to permanent fast-forward. Their full school day and her job as a lawyer's assistant are busy enough. But Hagner also has to take the two boys to soccer or hockey or basketball while dropping off her daughter at piano lessons or Girl Scout Club. Often, the exhausted family doesn't get home until 7 pm. There is just time for a quick supper before homework. In today's world, middle-class American and British parents treat their children as if they are competitors racing for some finishing line. Parents take their children from activity to activity in order to make their future bright. It seems that raising a genius has become a more important goal than raising a happy and well-balanced child. ""Doctors across the country are reporting a growing number of children suffering from stomachaches and headaches due to exhaustion and stress,"" says child expert William Doherty of the University of Minnesota. Teachers are dealing with exhausted kids in the classroom. It's a very serious problem. Many children attend after-school clubs by necessity. But competitive pressures also create an explosion of activities. They include sports, language, music and math classes for children as young as four. ""There is a new parenting trend under way which says that you have to tap all your child's potential at a young age; otherwise you will let him down,"" says Terry Alter, a Cambridge-based child and adolescent psychiatrist ""It isn't entirely new: there have always been pushy parents. But what was previously seen as strange behaviour is now well accepted."""	['give their children little time to develop freely']
Which of the following can best describe the author's feeling when he unfolded the paper?	The life of an actor appears attractive and many young people dream about becoming one. But the truth is, it is very hard work. If you're successful, there are deadlines to be met, appointments to keep and the press to deal with. If you're not successful, then life is extremely tough. I remember when I started out, I had to search the advertisement board at my drama school every day to look for acting jobs. Drama school was expensive and I needed extra cash to help pay the fees. I welcomed every small job. I played extras in many crowd scenes and became a confident participant in a lot of TV commercials for hair shampoo, soap and washing powder. I had been working for about two years before I got my lucky break. One day, as I was passing the drama school, I decided to go in to check the notice board. There was nothing on it and I was just leaving when the secretary came along the corridor with a piece of paper. She asked me how I was and I told her life was hard and work was difficult to find. The next moment, she put the paper in my hand and walked away. My hands were shaking as I unfolded the paper, full of expectation. To my surprise, it was an audition for a clown for the Canadian circus. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I had expected an audition with a famous director for a new film! When I was at drama school, there had been a course in acrobatics and clown tricks. I had gained top marks in this course for originality and daring. Later I went to the audition feeling very strange. This was not what I'd had in mind when I enrolled in drama school. To my surprise, the job as a clown turned out to be exactly what I wanted. I loved every moment of getting dressed up and putting on the make-up. I had the opportunity to travel the world and I was more than an actor, I was an entertainer as well. I had visited over 32 different countries and entertained millions of people.	['Feeling anxious and excited.']
Which of the following is ture ?	Naturally, American schoolchildren love holidays. And they get a lot of them each year. Besides having national holidays such as Thanksgiving and Presidents' Day off from school, students get longer breaks in the spring and during the summer holidays .In fact, kids in US only go to school for about 180 days a year .To students, holidays are perfect .However, parents think there are advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, school holidays allow families to spend time together. Many American parents take time off from work during June ,July or August to travel with their children on vacation either in US or a foreign country. On the other hand, schoolchildren get much more time off school than parents get vacation time. This means that parents with young children may have to pay more in babysitting or daycare costs. As well, the long summer holidays mean that students sometimes get bored . Besides going on trips with their parents, American students enjoy taking part in different kinds of activities during the holidays. For example, some kids enjoy summer camps and outdoor adventure holidays. Such trips are great for adventurous students. _ also have a lot to offer students who aren't usually interested in traditional PE activities. You can do courses in survival skills, for example. Students learn how to make a camp in the forest, which wild food they can eat and how to find their way back to the center. Students who are not excited about summer camps and outdoor adventure may take part in courses in computer game design, filmmaking and photography during the holidays. Finally, the traditional school trip to foreign countries is always popular. Students can practice their foreign language skills and experience everyday life in a different culture.

Why did the man stay on this island?	"Once a man was shipwrecked on a small, lonely island. There was no one living on this island, so he hoped that someone could come to save him. Every day he watched the sea, but no ships ever appeared. He thought he should do something to save himself. He built a little house out of wood. But one day, he arrived home to find his little house on fire. The smoke rose to the sky. He cried,""God, how could you do this to me?"" Early the next day, however, a ship was coming to the island. It came to save him. ""How did you know I was here?""The man asked these people.""We saw your smoke signal ,""they answered. It is easy to get _ when things are going badly. But we shouldn't lose heart, because hope is at work in our lives. Remember, next time your little house is burning to the ground, it just may bring you better luck."

In which column of a newspaper can you see this article?	"Children today spend less time outdoors than ever before and it may be harmful not only to their physical health, but also to their cognitive development. A year-long study, recently published in the Sciences, found that elementary school children who were exposed to more green space within or directly outside their school showed improved learning and memory. The findings reinforce that of a recent six-year study on 905 Massachusetts public elementary schools, which found that students in schools that had more ""greenness"" in their surroundings reported higher scores on standardized testing in English and math. ""There is an expanding body of scientific evidence linking the human experience in the natural world to better physical and mental health and improved cognitive abilities,"" journalist Richard Louv, co-founder of the Children & Nature Network, said in an email to The Huffington Post. ""An increasing number of homeschoolers, nature preschools, independent primary and secondary schools, and forward-thinking public schools are incorporating nature experience into learning."" The new study was conducted on more than 2,500 children in second, third and fourth grade at 36 primary schools in Barcelona, Spain. Researchers found that the students who attended schools with more green space showed a 5 percent improvement in the short-term memory that's critical for reasoning, learning and comprehension. But their inattentiveness decreased slightly. Spending time outside could have a number of benefits for children beyond improved memory and attention. Another recent study found that adventurous outdoor play such as climbing, rough and tumble play, and exploring alone improves children's physical health while also help them develop creativity and social skills greatly. Some schools are starting to take notice, creating more space for children to enjoy being in nature, including community gardens, outdoor playgrounds and small parks."	['Education.']
The five Scots went into the toilet in order to _ .	"I have come across some really excellent examples of British humour in the form of jokes. Here is a very funny joke about how the English and the Scottish save on train fare. Five Englishmen boarded a train just behind five Scots, who as a group had only bought one ticket. Just before the conductor came, all the Scots went into the toilet. As the conductor passed the toilet, he knocked and called, ""Tickets, please!' One of the Scots slid a ticket out under the door. It was punched and pushed back. When it was safe, all the Scots came out and took their seats. The Englishmen were quite impressed by what the Scots had done. On the trip back, the five Englishmen decided to try this themselves and bought only one ticket. They noticed that the Scots had not bought any tickets this time. Anyway again, just before the conductor came, the Scots went into one of the toilets, the Englishmen into the other. Then one of the Scots leaned out, knocked on the Englishmen's toilet and called, ""Tickets, please!"" When the ticket was slid out under the door, he picked it up and quickly closed the door. English humor shows the ups and downs of life in Britain. Humour helps us to look at the lighter side of things. So, if you want a good laugh, and want to change your attitude to what would otherwise be a difficult situation, turn to a good English situation comedy and have a good time."

What can we infer from what Nick Smith said?	"New Zealand will create one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, spanning an area of 620,000 sq km. The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary will be one of the world's most significant fully protected ecosystems, the prime minister of New Zealand, John Key, told the UN General Assembly in New York. The sanctuary is in the South Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 km north-east of New Zealand, and expands a marine reserve that surrounds some small islands. The area is considered important in terms of biodiversity, featuring nearly 35 species of whales and dolphins, 150 types of fish and three of the world's seven sea turtle species. It is also geologically significant, including the world's longest chain of underwater volcanoes and the second deepest ocean trench, into 10 km underwater -- deeper than Mount Everest's height. The scale of the sanctuary will dwarf any previous New Zealand's protected area, spanning twice the size of the country's mainland. It will cover 15% of New Zealand's economic zone. Commercial and recreational fishing will be completely banned, as will oil, gas and mineral prospecting , exploration and mining. Key's government aims to pass legislation establishing the sanctuary next year. ""The sanctuary is a world-class, unspoiled marine environment and New Zealand is proud to protect it for future generations,""Key said.""New Zealanders value our coasts and oceans, which are an important part of our culture, economy and environment and we are committed to managing them sustainably. Creating protected areas will support not only our own fisheries, but those of our Pacific neighbors, adding to New Zealand's efforts to help grow Pacific economies through the responsible management of their ocean resources."" Nick Smith, New Zealand's environment minister, said the sanctuary might impose a cost upon the mining industry but that it is important to protect the ocean before exploration takes place.""New Zealand needs to use its vast ocean resources for jobs and exports in industries like fishing, aquaculture, minerals and energy, but we also need to set aside special areas where nature comes first and marine life is fully protected,"" Smith said. New Zealand will monitor the area via its navy and satellite technology. The Kermadec region will join three other key areas in the Pacific protected by the US, the UK and Australia. Matt Rand, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' Global Ocean Legacy campaign, welcomed Key's announcement.""New Zealand will create the gold standard of conservation areas in the sanctuary, preserving one of the few relatively unspoiled areas of ocean on Earth,"" he said. ""This commitment is an exciting step toward meeting global goals to safeguard at least 30% of the ocean through fully protected marine reserves."""

Which is the best title for the passage?	"It was the last day of final exams in a university. On the steps of one building, a group of engineering students were discussing the exam. On their faces was confidence . This was their last exam and then they would graduate. With all these four years of college behind them, they felt ready to go into the world. The professor had said they could bring any book or note they wanted, but they could not talk to each other. They went into the classroom happily. The professor gave them the papers. They smiled when they found that there were only five questions. Three hours passed and the professor began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked so confident . The professor faced the class. No one spoke. They just held papers in their hands. The professor then asked, ""How many of you finished all five questions?"" Not a hand was raised. ""How many answered four?"" Still no hand. ""Three? Two?"" The students looked worried in their seats. ""One, then?"" Certainly somebody finished one. However, nobody replied. The professor put down the papers. ""That is just what I thought,"" he said. ""I just want to tell you that, even though you have finished four years of engineering, there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are quite common in everyday practice."" Then he added with a smile, ""You will all pass this course, but remember----even though you are now college graduates, your education has just begun."""	['So Much to Learn']
Once Buddy was on the bus, he felt the strangest pain . The reason probably is _ .	"Parents divorced, little Buddy was in the care of his mother's large Alabama family. Over the years, Buddy seldom saw either of his parents. But he was happy where he was and he had many kindly s, among whom Miss Sook was by far his best friend. Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep. Then I crept downstairs and examined the tags attached to each of the packages. They all said: ""For Buddy."" I decided to open the packages: It was Christmas morning. I was awake, so why not? I won't bother to describe what was inside them: just shirts and sweaters and dull stuff like that. The only thing I appreciated was a toy gun. Somehow I got the idea it would be fun to waken my father by firing it. So I did. Bang. Bang. Bang. He raced out of his room, wild-eyed, Bang. Bang. Bang. ""Buddy--what the hell do you think you're doing? Bang. Bang. Bang. ""Stop that!"" I laughed. "" Look, Daddy. Look at all wonderful things Santa Claus brought me."" Calm now, he walked into the room and hugged me. ""You like what Santa Claus brought you?"" I smiled at him. He smiled at me. There was a tender lingering moment, damaged when I said: ""Yes. But what are you going to give me, Daddy?"" His smile evaporated. His eyes narrowed suspiciously--you could see that he thought I was pulling some kind of trick. But then he blushed, as though he was ashamed to be thinking what he was thinking. He patted my head, and coughed and said: ""Well, I thought I'd wait and let you pick out something you wanted. Is there anything particular you want?"" I reminded him of the airplane we had seen in the toy store on Canal Street. His face sagged. Oh, yes, he remembered the airplane and how expensive it was. Nevertheless, the next day I was sitting in that airplane dreaming I was zooming toward heaven while my father wrote out a check for a happy salesman, who promised to help ship the plane on the bus. But I wasn't free of New Orleans yet. The problem was a large bottle of wine; maybe it was because of my departure, but anyway my father had been drinking it all day, and on the way to the bus station, he scared me by grabbing my wrist and harshly whispering: ""I'm not going to let you go. I can't let you go back to that crazy family in that crazy old house. Just look at what they've done to you. A boy six, almost seven, talking about Santa Claus! It's all their fault, all those sour old spinsters with their Bibles and their knitting needles, those drunken uncles. Listen to me, Buddy. There is no God! There is no Santa Claus."" He was squeezing my wrist so hard that it ached. ""Kiss me. Please. Please. Kiss me. Tell your daddy that you love him."" But I couldn't speak. I was terrified I was going to miss my bus. And I was worried about my plane, which was strapped to the top of the taxi. ""Say it: 'I love you.' Say it. Please. Buddy. Say it."" It was lucky for me that our taxi-driver was a good-hearted man. Because if it hadn't been for his help, and the help of some efficient porters and a friendly policeman, I don't know what would have happened when we reached the station. My father was so drunk he could hardly walk, but the policeman talked to him, quieted him down, helped him to stand straight, and the taxi-man promised to take him safely home. But my father would not leave until he had seen the porters put me on the bus. Once I was on the bus, I crouched in a seat and shut my eyes. I felt the strangest pain. A crushing pain that hurt everywhere. I thought if I took off my heavy city shoes, those crucifying monsters, the agony would ease. I took them off, but the mysterious pain did not leave me. In a way it never has; never will. Twelve hours later I was home in bed. The room was dark. Sook was sitting beside me, rocking in a rocking chair, a sound as soothing as ocean waves. I had tried to tell her everything that had happened, and only stopped when I was hoarse as a howling dog. She stroked her fingers through my hair, and said: ""Of course there is a Santa Clause. It's just that no single somebody could do all he has to do. So the Lord has spread the task among us all. That's why everybody is Santa Claus. I am. You are. Even you cousin Billy Bob. Now go to sleep. Count stars. Think of the quietest thing. Like snow. I'm sorry you didn't get to see any. But now snow is falling through the stars--"" Stars sparkled, snow whirled inside my head; the last thing I remembered was the peaceful voice of the Lord telling me something I must do. And the next day I did it. I went with Sook to the post office and bought a penny postcard. That same postcard exists today. It was found in my father's safety deposit box when he died last year. Here is what I had written him: Hello pop hope you are well I am and I am turning to pedal my plane so fast I will soon be in the sky so keep your eyes open and yes I love you Buddy."

The author suggests that when men live together _ .	A man living absolutely alone in a desert or forest is free from other people; but he is not absolutely free. His freedom is limited in several ways. Firstly, by the things around him, such as wild animals or cliffs too steep to climb. Secondly, by his own needs: he must have sleep, water, food and shelter from extreme heat or cold. Lastly, by his own nature as a man: disease may attack him, and death will certainly come to him sooner or later. When men live together, on the other hand, protection against wild animals is easier and they can work together to get food and build shelters; but each man has to give up some of his freedom so that he can live happily with the others. When men become organized into very large groups, and civilization develops, it is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could if he were living alone; but such a society can not work successfully unless the freedom of each human being is to some extent limited so that he is kept from hurting others. I am not free to kill others, nor to steal someone else's property, nor to behave in a way that offends against the moral sense of the society in which I live. I have to limit my own freedom myself so that others will not limit it too much: I agree to respect the rights of others, and in return they agree to respect mine. The advantages of such an agreement are great: one man can become a doctor, knowing that others will grow food, make clothes and build a house for him, in return for the work he does to keep them healthy. If each man had to grow his own food, make his own clothes, build his own house and learn to be his own doctor, he would find it impossible to do any one of these jobs really well. By working together, we make it possible for society to provide us all with food, clothes, shelter and medical care, while leaving each of us with as much freedom as it can.

How many research results are presented in the text?	"BEIJING, Jan. 11(Xinhuanet)-- Sleeping a little bit longer a day might help fight against obesity , a recent study shows. The research-- published in the Archives of Internal Medicine along with an editorial by Turek and Northwestern colleague Joseph Bass commenting on it and related research-- after comparing people of normal weight- a body mass index of less than 25- with those who were overweight or _ , found that sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night could offer a pain-free way to lose weight. Insufficient sleep is linked with changes in hormone levels that may stimulate appetite. A series of studies in recent months have shown that the less people sleep, the heavier they tend to be. American researcher Robert Vorona from Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk and colleagues have now examined the relationship between people's self-reported sleep time per 24 hours and their body mass index(BMI). They found that total sleep time and BMI were inversely correlated was total sleep time decreased, BMI increased, except in the severely obese group."" Americans experience insufficient sleep and corpulent bodies. Clinicians are aware of the burden of obesity on patients,"" the study said. ""Our findings suggest that major extensions of sleep time may not be necessary, as an extra 20 minutes of sleep per night seems to be associated with a lower body mass index,"" it added. ""We warn that this study does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between restricted sleep and obesity (but) investigations demonstrating success in weight loss via extensions of sleep would help greatly to establish such a relationship."" In November 2004, researchers from Columbia University in New York City, New York demonstrated a clear link between the risk of being obese and hours of nightly sleep, finding that people aged 32 to 59 who slept four hours or less per night were 73% more likely to be obese than people who slept between seven and nine hours per night."

The 1920s is called _ .	"The 1920s was a decade of wealth, decadence and social changes. They were known as the Roaring Twenties, and the best place to experience this exciting time was New York City. But what was it really like? Prohibition In 1919, a new law in the US known as Prohibition made it illegal to buy and sell alcohol. But Prohibition didn't stop people drinking; it just drove the sale of strong alcoholic drink underground. Bootleggers waited off the coast of New York after dark and brought illegal alcohol into the city. Jazz Jazz was the music of New York in the 1920s. In fact, the decade is called Jazz Age. The best place to listen to this new form of music was the Cotton Club in Harlem. All the great jazz musicians played at the Cotton Club, including Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington. Also, in 1942 George Gershwin composed the jazz--influenced Rhapsody in Blue. The piece has been called ""a musical portrait of New York"" and was used by Woody Allen in his filmManhattan. Art Deco Art Deco was the most popular style of the 1920s, with bright colors and geometric designs; it can be seen in the art, architecture and inside designs of the period. New York is full of Art Deco buildings, but the most famous ones are the Chrysler Building (built between 1928 and 1930) and the Empire State Building (built between 1930 and 1931). The Great Depression On 29th October, 1929, the Roaring Twenties came to a dramatic end. On that day (known as ""Black Tuesday""), the US stock market crashed, causing the Great Depression. The economic downturn lasted ten years and affected most of the Western world. Unemployment in America reached 25% and the country didn't recover until after World War II."	['Jazz Age']
When is Halloween?	"Halloween is a festival on October 31. The name of the holiday means ""hallowed"" because it happens the day before All Saints Day. Before the festival, people paint homes, shops and classrooms in the traditional Halloween colours, orange and black. Some people make costumes and masks at home. Some people buy them in shops. People also make decorations for the festival. These decorations look like witches, black cats, ghosts, skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Jack-o-lanterns are pumpkins that are cut to look like faces. People think that Halloween is the children's New Year's Eve. They dress up in special costumes and masks. They eat too much, and go to bed too late celebrating. They go from one door to another saying ""trick or treat"". People give them candies, cookies, fruit or money. Adults and older children also celebrate Halloween with parades , festivals and costumes parties. One kind of the parties welcomed by children is dunking for apples. Apples are put in tubs full of water. People try to get the apples using only their months; they cannot use their hands."	"[""It's on the day before All Saints Day.""]"
Which is TRUE according to the passage _ ?	"Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability. People with autism have trouble communicating and with social skills. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the person also might repeat some behaviors and not want change in their daily activities. Some people with the condition need a lot of help. Others need less. CDC officials say autism affects one in every 68 children in the United States. More boys than girls are believed to have the condition. But the number of cases appears to be growing. It is unclear whether the growing number shows a real increase or comes from more knowledge about this disorder. Symptoms of autism Common signs of autism include trouble making eye contact and a delay in learning how to speak. Some people with severe autism never learn how to talk. Many people with autism also have difficulty understanding facial expressions and the feelings of others. They also have trouble making friends of the same age. Doctors have learned how to recognize autism, but much is still unknown about its causes. Researchers at Harvard University have come closer to finding answers. They found that women exposed to the highest levels of fine particulate air pollution late in their pregnancies are two times more likely to give birth to a child with autism. The findings appeared in Environmental Health Perspectives -- a publication of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The study found that the women who were around high levels of fine particulate matter air pollution were at highest risk of having an autistic child. The increased risk of these women was two times that of women who lived in areas with low levels of fine particulate pollution. The researchers found that the timing of exposure to pollution was important. They found no increased risk of autism in children whose mothers were around high levels of pollution before becoming pregnant. And the study found air pollution does not seem to increase the risk of children developing autism after they are born. What can pregnant women do? Mr. Weisskopf says pregnant women should avoid air pollution as much as possible. But he warns that other things may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. ""You can avoid being in extremely polluted cities during pregnancy if possible. You can also choose to go running in a park rather than next to a street. But that said, I think also it's very important to recognize that autism spectrum disorders is a very multi-factorial disorder. And there are lots of reasons why risk could be increased."" Autism is believed to result from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. For now, Marc Weisskopf says researchers are trying to identify the exact substances in air pollution that increase the risk of autism."

The quantifying ability refers to the ability to _ .	"Parents are often amazed at how fast their child grows and develops. New research has determined that the ability to quantify may develop much sooner than most parents realize. Kristy vanMarle, professor of the University of Missouri, has determined that contrary to what previous studies have shown, infants are able to quantify substances --like sand or water--as early as 10 months. As long as the difference between the two substances is large enough, infants will choose the larger amount, especially when it comes to food. With the assistance of her team researchers, vanMarle tested the quantifying skills of babies by presenting them with two cups: one containing a small amount of food, and one containing a larger amount. Consistently, the babies chose the larger amount. ""Several studies throughout the last 15 years have shown that infants are very good at telling how many objects they see; however, infants don't seem to count things like water or sand,"" vanMarle said. ""What we're saying is that they can quantify substances; The infants can see how much food goes into each cup and compare that in their memories. They decide which amount is larger, and they almost always select the larger one."" This information further refutes the long-held idea that babies ""know nothing of the world,"" vanMarle said. ""Since psychologists have begun studying infants with sensitive measures, we've discovered a lot of early abilities. I think for parents, it should be exciting to know that there's somebody there that has some fundamental and basic knowledge of the world, and that knowledge is guiding their development,"" vanMarle said. In the future, vanMarle says this kind of study could be linked to a child's progress in math-related skills, although programs marketed to increase those abilities, such as ""Baby Einstein,"" still have mixed reviews when it comes to academic study."

When will wolves howl according to the passage?	"Wolves travel in groups, and they perform almost all the other activities of their lives in the company of fellow wolves. This is one of the most important facts that modern science have learned about wolves and one of the things that most clearly explain their way of life. The pack is usually a family group. It is made up of animals related to each other by blood. The centre of a pack is a pair of wolves----an adult male and female that have produced young. The other members of the pack are their offspring : young wolves ranging in age from pups to two- and three-year-olds. Most packs have 6 or 7 members, although some may include as many as 15 wolves. Relationships among creatures that live close together in groups are often very complex, and this is true of the ties that connect the members of a wolf pack. Scientific studies of captive wolves and wolf packs in the wild have shown that many complex rules of behavior seem to govern the way that the animals relate to each other. When wolf pups are born into a pack, one of the most important things they must learn is the ""language"" of the group, the method by which pack members keep in touch with each other, sharing information and communicating their feelings. Scientists have discovered that wolves have a very complex system of communication. The most famous wolf sound is, of course, the howl, and it is a very important part of wolf language. When people think about howling, they usually imagine a sad, lonely sound made by a wolf sitting all alone on a hilltop in the moonlight. However, this picture in most human beings' mind is not completely true. Wolves howl at any time, not just at night, and they often howl together, not alone. Group or chorus howling is another means by which the members of a wolf reaffirm their ties with each other and their closeness as a group. One wolf----often the male leader----will point its nose at the sky, open its mouth, and start to howl. Immediately the other members of the pack rush to stand beside him, shoulder to shoulder, and join their voices to his. Each wolf howls on its own note so that a big chorus of slightly different sounds is produced. Chorus howling often takes place before a wolf pack goes out to hunt. At the end of a successful hunt, the pack may also celebrate with a group howl. While wolves are on the track of prey ,they are usually silent. There are occasions when a wolf will howl by itself. This may happen when an animal is separated from the pack. Pack members seem to recognize each other's voices and will keep responding to the howl of their wandering relative until the group is reunited. Because howling is a sound that carries over a considerable distance, it is very useful in communications among separated members of a pack. Howling is also used when members of different packs have to get in touch with each other to pass on information about their locations and their purposes."	['When separated from the pack']
Amy's mother shared the news of a Christmas Wish Contest that day because she knew _ .	"As Amy Hagadorn rounded the corner across the hall from her classroom, she crashed with a tall boy from the fifth grade running in the opposite direction. ""Watch it, Squirt,"" the boy yelled, as he dodged around the little third grader. Then, with an unfriendly smile on his face, the boy took hold of his right leg and mimicked the way Amy limped when she walked. Amy closed her eyes for a moment. --Ignore him, she told herself as she headed for her classroom. But at the end of the day, Amy was still thinking about the tall boy's mean teasing. It wasn't as if he were the only one. Amy was tired of it. Sometimes, even in a classroom full of other students, the teasing about her speech or her limping made her feel all alone. Back home at the dinner table that evening Amy was quiet. That's why Patti Hagdorn was happy to havesome exciting news to share with her daughter. ""There's a Christmas Wish Contest on the radio station,"" she announced. ""Write a letter to Santa and you might win a prize. I think someone at this table with blond curly hair should enter."" Amy giggled. The contest sounded like fun. She started thinking about what she wanted most for Christmas. A smile took hold of Amy when the idea first came to her. Out came pencil and paper and Amy went to work on her letter. --Dear Santa Claus, she began. While Amy worked away at her best printing, the rest of the family tried to guess what she might ask from Santa. Amy's sister, Jamie, and Amy's mom both thought a 3-foot Barbie Doll would top Amy's wish list. Amy's dad guessed a picture book. But Amy wasn't ready to reveal her secret Christmas wish just then. Here is Amy's letter to Santa, just as she wrote it that night: Dear Santa Clause, My name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy . I just want one day where no one laughs at me or makes fun of me. Love, Amy At radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. The workers had fun reading about all the different presents that boys and girls from across the city wanted for Christmas. When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully. He knew cerebral palsy was a muscle disorder that might confuse the schoolmates of Amy who didn't understand her disability. He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper. The next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the News Sentinel. The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television station reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable Christmas gift - just one day without teasing. Suddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement. During that unforgettable Christmas season, over two thousand people from all over the world sent Amy letters of friendship and support. Amy and her family read every single one. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Many people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other. She realized that no amount or form of teasing could ever make her feel lonely again. Amy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at South Wayne Elementary School. Additionally, everyone at school got an added bonus. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel. That year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson. ""Everyone,"" said the mayor, ""wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth."""	"[""things weren't going well with Amy at school""]"
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"My life plan is to visit all the states in the US. Several years ago, my husband and I were traveling in the northwest. One day, when we were having our breakfast, I lost my wallet that had over $300 in it. There was no way for us to be able to find it, but we went on with our trip. We went off to drive around and enjoy the city, completely forgetting my missing wallet. Later on, when I checked my phone, there was a message from the boss of the restaurant where we had our breakfast: ""I have something that belongs to you, and you're going to be very happy."" We got back to the restaurant and there was the wallet on the table with all the money in it! The boss's son found the wallet in front of the door, and brought it to him. He thought that it must belong to someone who had a meal in the restaurant, so he checked inside and found my phone number on a piece of paper."	"[""It was in front of the restaurant's door that the wallet was found.""]"
The main idea of this passage could best be stated as _ .	The first outstanding deaf teacher in America was a Frenchman Laurent Clerc. He and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's first school for the deaf. When Laurent Clerc was one year old, he fell into a fire. As a result, he lost both his hearing and his sense of smell. At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help. He met a French educator of the deaf who invited him to Paris to learn at the Royal Institution for the Deaf. Gallaudet went to the Royal Institution for the Deaf, where Clerc became his Sign Language teacher. The two worked and studied well together. When the time came for Gallaudet to return to America, he asked Clerc to come with him. The two men set sail on June 18, 1816. The voyage across the Atlantic Ocean took 52 days; however, Clerc and Gallaudet put the time to good use. They discussed the school for the deaf which they planned to open. On the long trip, they had many conversations about education and deafness. The year after they arrived, they founded a school for the deaf in Harford, Connecticut.

Where did this accident happen?	"An explosion( ) from a factory in Kunshan killed at least 69 people and more than 120 people got hurt. China had its worst accident in industry on a Saturday in 2014. The accident happened in Kunshan city, Jiangsu Province in China. And the explosion was from Zhongrong Metal Products Company, who makes car wheels for the U.S. The Kunshan government told us 264 workers were there when the explosion happened and 44 died at once. ""We heard a really loud explosion at about 7 a.m. this morning, so we rushed out of our rooms, "" said Zhou Xu, a 26-year-old worker at that company. Another worker said, ""First the ambulance came and then many wives rushed to the factory to see if their husbands were okay."" Now, Shanghai government is sending doctors to Kunshan to save the wounded. And the doctor said the number of the dead may increase. Chinese government is looking into the cause of the disaster. And President Xi also paid special attention to it. He said, "" Those who are found responsible must be punished."""	['Kunshan city in Jiangsu province.']

What caused Kemmons to start a motel by himself?	"Some people bring out the best in you in a way that you might never have fully realized on your own. My mom was one of those people. My father died when I was nine months old, making my mom a single mother at the age of eighteen. While I was growing up, we lived a very hard life. We had little money, but my mom gave me a lot of love. Each night, she sat me on her lap and spoke the words that would change my life, ""Kemmons, you are certain to be a great man and you can do anything in life if you work hard enough to get it."" At fourteen, I was hit by a car and the doctors said I would never walk again. Every day,my mother spoke to me in her gentle,loving voice, telling me that no matter what those doctors said, I would walk again if I want to badly enough. She drove that message so deep into my heart that I finally believed her.A year I returned to school--walking on my own ! When the Great Depression hit, my mom lost her job. Then I left school to support the both of us. At that moment, I was determined never to be poor again. Over the years, I experienced various levels of business success. But the real turning point occurred on a vacation I took with my wife and five kids in1951. I was dissatisfied with the second-class hotels available for families and was angry that they charged an extra $2 for each child. That was too expensive for the average American family. I told my wife that I was going to open a motel for families that would never charge extra for children. There were plenty of doubters at that time. Not surprisingly, Mom was one of my strongest supporters. She worked behind the desk and even designed the room style. As in any business,we experienced a lot of challenges. But with my mother's words deeply rooted in my soul, I never doubted we would succeed.Fifteen years later,we had the largest hotel system in the world--Holiday Inn. In 1979 my company had 1759 inns in more than fifty countries with an income of $1billion a year. You may not have started out life in the best situations. But if you can find a task in life worth working for and believe in yourself, nothing can stop you."	['His terrible experience in the hotel']
The reason why we should use different kinds of plants to clean the air is that _ .	The effects of air pollution on natural conditions have been a disturbing problem for many years. Some scientists hold the view that the air inside houses may be more dangerous than the air outside. It may even be one hundred times worse. Most scientists agree that every modern house has some kind of indoor pollution, which can cause a person to feel tired, to suffer eye pain, headache and other problems. Believe it or not, some pollutants can cause breathing diseases of blood and even cancer. What made us feel relieved is that there's growing concern about the problem now. It is true that when builders began constructing houses and offices they did not want to waste energy. they built buildings that prevented or limited the flow of air between inside and outside. For the same purpose, man-made building materials were employed to build houses, which are now known to let out some harmful gases. Facing the serious challenge, scientists have been searching for a way to handle the problem. To everyone's delight, they discovered a natural pollution control system for building--green plants, though they do not really know how plants control air pollution. Scientists suppose that a plant's leaves absorb or take in the pollutants and in exchange gives out oxygen through its leaves and tiny organizations on its roots. Therefore they recommend that all buildings should have one large plant or several small plants inside for every nine square meters of space. Because studies indicate that different plants absorb different chemicals, the most effective way to clean the air is to use different kinds of plants. In conclusion, having green plants inside your house can make it a prettier and healthier place. Why not try?	['plants can absorb different harmful indoor chemical']
What can we infer from the passage?	"Cell Phones Are the New Cigarettes When you get on a bus, you reach for it. When you're at work, you take a break to have a moment alone with it. When you are waiting for dinner, you play with it. Cigarette? No, it's another most addictive thing in the beginning of the 21st century, the cell phone (i.e. the mobile phone). Experts say it is becoming more difficult for many people to curb their wishing to hug it more tightly than most of their personal relationships. With its charming surface and its satisfying touch, the cell phone connects us even if we are only three feet away. In just the past few years, the cell phone has challenged individuals, employers, phone makers and counselors in ways that its inventors in the late 1940s never imagined. The costs are becoming even more evident, and I don't mean just the monthly bill. Dr. Chris Knippers, a counselor at the Betty Ford Center in Southern California, reports that the overuse of cell phones has caused a social problem: a barrier to one-on-one personal contact. This may sound extreme. But we've all witnessed the evidence: the person at a restaurant who talks on the phone through an entire meal, ignoring his kids around the table; the woman who talks on the phone all the way, ignoring her husband; the teenager who texts messages all the way home from school, avoiding contact with other kids all around him. How is this improving the quality of our life? Jim Williams, an industrial sociologist based in Massachusetts, notes that cell-phone addiction is a symptom in a widening gulf of personal separation. The study conducted in 2014 notes that one-quarter of Americans say they have no one to discuss their most important personal business with. Despite the growing use of phones, e-mail and instant messaging, we young people don't have as many friends as our parents. ""Just as more information has led to less wisdom, more acquaintances via the Internet and cell phones have produced fewer friends,"" he says. (366 words)"	"[""Overusing cell phones won't make our life more enjoyable.""]"
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"Never go into a supermarket hungry! This is a good piece of advice. If you go shopping for food before lunchtime, you'll probably buy more than you plan to. Unfortunately, however, just this advice isn't enough for shoppers these days. Modern shoppers need an education in how and how not to buy things at the store. First, you check the weekly newspaper ads. Find out the items that are on sale and decide if you really need these things. In other words, don't buy anything just because it's cheaper than usual! Second, never let ""New and Improved!"" or ""All Natural"" on the front of a package influence you. Instead, read the list of contents on the back. Third,compare prices: that is, you should examine the prices of both different brands and different sizes of the same brand. Another suggestion for shoppers is to buy ordinary items instead of famous brands. Ordinary items in supermarkets come in plain packages. These products are cheaper because producers don't spend much money on packing or advertising. However, they are still of high quality. In the same way, in buying clothes, you can often find high quality and low prices in brands that are not famous. Shopping in discount clothing stores can help you save a lot of money. Although these stores aren't very attractive, and they usually do not have individual dressing rooms, not only are the prices low, but you can often find the same famous brands that you find in high-priced department stores. Wise shoppers read magazine ads and watch TV commercials ,but they do this with one advantage: knowledge of the psychology behind the ads. In other words, will-informed shoppers watch for information and check for misinformation. They ask themselves questions: Is the advertiser hiding something in small print at the bottom of the page? Is there any real information in the commercial, or is the advertiser simply showing an attractive image? With the answers to these questions, shoppers can make a wise choice."	['the quality of ordinary items can be as good as that of famous brands.']
Lang Ping avoided meeting the reporters and fans probably because she _ .	"A couple of years ago, before a trip to China, Nicole Davis and her US women's volleyball teammates were warned about the prominence (, ) of coach ""Jenny"" Lang Ping in her native country. ""I was pushed over by Chinese journalists while I was just trying to put my luggage on the bus,"" said Davis. Known as the ""Iron Hammer"" for her punishing spikes , Lang made it possible for China to dominate in the sport in the early 1980s. She was a key player on China's 1984 Olympic gold medal winning team. When the US team arrived for the Olympics, Lang, 48, who is from Beijing, had to take a different route to avoid a crowd of reporters and fans. Then came the greatest moment to Lang:while the US team was playing in a packed gym, at least 8,000 Chinese fans _ an American flag. ""That really says it all,"" Davis said. ""They look at her as an icon .I'm sure it's hard for them to see her coaching another country, but they love her so deeply that her success is their success."" The loyalty of the Chinese fans was tested on Friday, when China lost a match to the US. ""It's a pity that China lost the match, but I'm still glad that Lang Ping's team won, since she is the pride of China's volleyball,"" said Liu Chengli, a spectator. ""We also cheered for Lang's victory."" Lang said she just tried to stay professional when the two teams meet. ""It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team. It's the same."" Lang said. Davis said she and her teammates could not have imagined the passion for volleyball among Chinese because the sport was lack of popularity in the US. The reception from Chinese fans has touched the US players, said a US volleyball player Lindsey Berg. ""It's such an honor to be here and play for our coach here in China,"" she said. ""The amount of support that the Chinese give to her and us has been tremendous. The whole event has been unbelievable."""	"[""didn't want to be paid much attention to""]"
Which of the following is true?	"Three years have passed since I entered the university. I haven't seen many of my classmates after we parted when the college entrance examination was over. So we decided to have a get-together party this summer vacation. As you can imagine, I could hardly wait to have the day for our reunion. After several month's waiting, 25 of my former higher school classmates and 3 of our teachers were crowded in a small restaurant near our high school. We were more than happy to meet with each other again. Our former Chinese teacher was so excited that he even choked to say some words. With gratitude, we thanked our teachers for their hard work; with great joy, we exchanged the happy things happening in each of our present colleges; We talked before someone shouted. ""Oh, it is 11:30 now."" But no one would be the first to say goodbye to others . I shall always bear this unforgettable get-together in my mind. With time passing, I believe I will meet many new friends, but I think the friendship among high school classmates will be the purest and will be the most valuable thing to cherish."	['The author thought the friendship in high school was well worth treasuring.']
Why could the man win the contest?	"Once, a king had a great highway built for his people. Just before it was opened to the public, the king decided to have a contest . He invited his people to take part in the contest. Their challenge was to see who could travel the highway the best. On the day of the contest, some people came to the highway in fine clothing; some had fancy hairstyles or brought great food. Some young men came in their sports clothes and ran along the highway. People raveled the highway all day. But each one, when he or she completed the trip, complained to the king that there was a large pile of stones in the way that had blocked his or her travels. At the end of the day, a lonely traveler crossed the finishing line and walked over to the king. He was tired and dirty, but he showed the king great respect and handed him a bag of gold. He explained: ""I stopped along the way to clear a pile of stones that was _ the road. This bag of gold was under it all. I want you to return it to its rightful owner."" The king replied: ""You are the rightful owner. You've earned this gold, for you won my contest."" The man won the contest just because he was the only one who stopped to make the road smoother . Sometimes, the greatest prize comes not from helping yourself, but from helping others."	['Because he was willing to help others.']
In his father's view, the most important quality a good person should have is _ .	"When I was growing up, I was unhappy to be seen with my father. He was disabled and quite short. He used to walk together with me and his hand was on my arm for balance. At this time, people would look at us strangely. I was afraid to look at others but he never cares. It was difficult to _ our steps -- his slow, mine impatient. But each time, he always said, ""You set the pace, I'll follow you."" He never talked about himself as a disabled man and nor did he envy other people's good fortune or health. What he looked for in others was a ""good heart"" -- a good heart in man. Now that I am older, I believe that is a right standard to judge people, even though I still don't know exactly what a ""good heart"" is. But I know the times when I don't have it. Unable to take part in many activities, my father still tried to participate in some way. When I played ball, he ""played"" it too. When I joined the Navy, he ""joined"" too. He often introduced me, saying ""This is my son, but it is also me, and I could have done this if things had been different."" He has been gone many years, but I am so sorry for my unwillingness to walk with him. I never told him how I regretted it. I think of him often when I complain about small affairs and when I don't have a ""good heart "". At such times, I want to put my hand on his arm and say, ""You set the pace, I'll try to follow you.

The present situation of the Great Wall is not optimistic due to the following reasons EXCEPT _ .	"It was originally built to defend an empire ,but now parts of the Great Wall of China are crumbling so badly they need someone to hurry to their defense. About 2,000 kilometers, or 30%,of the ancient fortification built in the Ming Dynasty has disappeared due to natural and human damage, according to the Beijing Times. And the situation could worsen, experts are warning as not enough is being done to preserve what remains. ""It's a great pity to witness the Great Wall in such terrible situation ,"" Mei Jingtian, a volunteer who has worked for three decades to safeguard the structure and has founded the Great Wall Protection Association, tells CNN. About 8,000 kilometers of the structure dates from the Ming period between the 14th and 17th centuries and is considered by some to be the original Great Wall.Of this, 2,000 kilometers is made up of naturally occurring earthworks - and so only 6,000 kilometers of actual Ming dynasty wall was ever built. Stretches built in other eras make up a total length estimated up to 21,000 kilometers. Many visitors to china associate the Great Wall with a widely restored stretch of Ming era wall at Badaling near Beijing, but this is far from typical of most of the structure. According to a 2014 survey done by the Great Wall of China Society, only about 8.2% of the Great Wall is in good condition, with74. 1% classified as poorly preserved, ""The Great Wall is a vast heritage site - over 20,000 kilometers - thus increasing the difficulty in preservation and restoration,"" Dong Yaohui, deputy director of the Great Wall of China Society, tells CNN. ""Reliance on a very small amount of manpower by the local heritage departments is not enough to guard and protect the site."" A recent increase in interest from tourists in visiting wild sections, known as the ""Wild Great Wall,"" has Accelerated its deterioration ,according to the report."	['wars between countries']
According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?	"A jobless man applied for the position of ""office boy"" at Microsoft.The HR manager interviewed him and then watched him cleaning the floor as a test.""You are employed,"" he said.""Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as the date when you may start."" The man replied, ""But I don't have a computer, neither an e-mail."" ""I'm sorry,"" said the HR manager.""If you don't have an email, that means you do not exist. And who doesn't exist cannot have the job."" The man left with no hope at all.He didn't know what to do, with only ten dollars in his pocket.He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy 10 kg tomatoes.He then sold the tomatoes from door to door.In less than two hours, he succeeded to double his capital . He repeated the operation three times, and returned home happily with 60 dollars. The man realized that he could survive in this way, and started to go every day earlier, and return later.Thus, his money doubled or _ every day.Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, and then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles.Five years later, the man was one of the biggest food retailers in the US. He started to plan his family's future and decided to have a life insurance.He called an insurance broker and chose a protection plan.When the conversation was concluded, the broker asked him his e-mail.The man replied, ""I don't have an e-mail.""The broker said curiously, ""You don't have an e-mail, and yet have succeeded to build an empire.Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an e-mail?"" The man thought for a while and replied, ""Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft !"""	"[""The man didn't give up though he failed the interview""]"
According to the passage, the author _ .	"My grandparents were married for over half a century, and played their own special game the time they had met each other. The goal of their game was to write the word ""shmily"" in a surprise place for the other to find. They took turns leaving ""shmily"" around the house, and as soon as one of them discovered it, it was their turn to hide it once more. They dragged ""shmily"" with their fingers through the sugar and flour containers to await whoever was preparing the next meal. ""Shmily"" was written in the steam left on the mirror after a hot shower, where it would reappear bath after bath. There was no end to the places where ""shmily"" would _ . Little notes with ""shmily"" were found on car seats, or taped to steering wheels. The notes were put inside shoes and left under pillows. ""Shmily"" was written in the dust upon the mantel and traced in the ashes of the fireplace. This mysterious word was as much a part of my grandparents' house as the furniture. It took me a long time before I was able to fully appreciate my grandparents' game. Skepticism has kept me from believing in true love --- one that is pure and enduring . However, I never doubted my grandparents' relationship. It was based on passionate affection which not everyone is lucky enough to experience. But there was a dark cloud in my grandparents' life: my grandmother had breast cancer. The disease had first appeared ten years earlier. As always, Grandpa was with her every step of the way. He comforted her in their yellow room, painted that way so that she could always be surrounded by sunshine, even when she was too sick to go outside. But my grandmother grew steadily weaker until, finally, she could not leave the house anymore. Then one day, what we all dreaded finally happened. Grandma was gone. ""Shmily."" It was written in yellow on the pink ribbons of my grandmother's funeral bouquet . As the crowd thinned and the last mourners turned to leave, Grandpa stepped up to my grandmother's coffin and, taking a shaky breath, he began to sing to her. Through his tears and grief, the song came: S-h-m-i-l-y: See How Much I Love You."	['doubted the existence of true love at first']

What is the lesson we can learn from this passage?	Too often we accuse others of not listening, pretending that we ourselves are faultless, yet in our hearts we know that many of the mistakes we make come about because we haven't listened carefully enough. We get things wrong because we haven't listened carefully enough. We get things wrong because we haven't quite understood what someone meant when they were talking to us. Anyone who has ever taken the minutes of a long meeting will know how hard it is to remember-- despite the benefit of notes-- exactly what everyone said. But success depends on getting things right--and that means listening. Listening is not the same thing as hearing; it is not an effort actively. It demands attention and concentration. It may mean quizzing the speaker for additional information or for clarification------ it is always better to ask than to continue regardless and get things wrong. However, if you allow your mind to wander onto something else, even for a few minutes, you'll miss what the speaker is saying------ probably at the very moment when he or she is saying something critical. And not having heard, you won't know you've missed anything until it's too late. The most common bad habit we have is to start thinking of what we are going to say about the subject long before the other speaker has finished. We then stop listening. Even worse, this often adds rudeness to inattentiveness, as once you have decided what to say there is a fair chance you will interrupt to say it. Good listeners don't interrupt. In fact it is often worth explaining the main idea of what you have just been told before going on to make your own points. Nobody is offended by this and it shows that you have listened well. Above all be patient and accept that many people are not very good communicators. It's helpful to remember that the ways people move and position themselves while they are speaking can reveal a great deal about what they are saying. Equally important you should put yourself in the other person's place, both intellectually and emotionally; it will help you to understand what they are getting at and form a response. But don't be too clever. Faced with a know-all, many people keep quiet because they see no point in continuing.	['Listening inattentively may cost you the loss of your success.']
On Mother's Day _ .	An American woman Anna Jarvis was the first person to decide the mothers should have a holiday in their honor each year. Miss Jarvis started her campaign in 1906 in her home city Philadelphia. She wrote thousands of letters to congressmen , city officials, teachers and newspaper publishers, proposing an official holiday for mothers. She traveled all over America, trying to get support for the idea. Her battle went on for years. In 1914, the Congress declared the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day. Anna Jarvis wanted Mother's Day to be a simple event. She thought children could honor their mothers by spending some time with them as an act of love and respect. However, the holiday turned out to be a major event for department stores, flower shops and greetingcard industry, which Miss Jarvis didn't like. Americans spend millions of dollars on gifts for their mothers on this day. Younger children often try to prepare and serve breakfast for their mothers. Fathers may offer to take care of children so that mothers can enjoy themselves. The holiday becomes an important time for family gathering.	['families gather together']
What will happen to Hutong in the nearfuture?	"Local officials in Beijing promised to furtherprotect the city's cultural heritage , in particular the narrow streets known as Hutong. Hutong are commonly found in the cities of North China, but they are at risk. Beijingis currently believed to have fewer than 1,000 Hutong, most of which are nearthe Forbidden City. Only 60 years ago, thenumber was 3,250. In the old districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng, which cover 62square kilometers, some people will be asked to move from Hutong houses toavoid further damage to the ancient architecture. ""On average more than 100,000 people visit the Forbidden City during the National Day holidays. Thevisits put pressure on the protection of cultural relics,"" said Huang Yan,director of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning, adding that Hutongshould be protected from human damage. The government focused on how the protection planswere carried out and how the management of cultural heritages worked. WangShaofeng, head of the Xicheng district government, said the area has 182cultural relics, many of which were built as far back as the Yuan Dynasty(1271-1368). The district of Xicheng has 1.28 million residents in its 57square kilometers of land. ""The most efficient way is to decrease the localpopulation to reduce the possibility of causing harm to the heritage,"" Wangsaid. ""Each community has been required to report thestatus of its cultural heritage, especially Hutong, and any actions to damagethe heritage will be punished,"" Wang said. No one knows for sure how many Hutong will be leftin the coming 100 years."	['Only time will tell.']
How long did the storm last?	Tuesday, Jan. 6, 9:50 p.m. We were sitting in our warm living room. The TV was on, and everything was peaceful. Suddenly the light went on and off for a few times and then went out completely. Then the rain started, and everything went black. We found the flashlight and some candles and went to bed. Wednesday, Jan. 7, 7:30 a.m. My first thought after waking up was that it was pretty cold in my bedroom. Clearly, the power didn't come back. After I looked out of the window, I felt even sadder: it was still raining heavily. The room was becoming colder and colder. We had no idea when the power would come back, so my wife started a fire in the fireplace. Thursday, Jan. 8, 12:30 p.m. The snow started. The poor trees now had to carry the heavy snow. The storm seemed to last and we had nothing to do but stay at home. Friday, Jan. 9, 6:00 p.m. Still no power. Even though we lit a few candles, it was still difficult to do anything in their weak light. I was sitting near several candles, but I had trouble reading. Saturday, Jan. 10, 1:00 p.m. The storm stopped this morning, and I drove my car to look for an open store. The trees along the roads were broken. I only bought the most necessary things: bread, some fruit, more drinking water and batteries for the flashlight. On my way home, the power came back and people were very happy.

According to Katrena R, her children _ .	A Child's History of the World Our Price: $28.00 Item #: 010821 ISBN: 978-8-8828-7028-7 Grades: 4--Adult Product Description V. M. Hillyer, the first headmaster of Calvert School, spent many of his school years studying only American history. Believing that studying world history would broaden children's horizons and give them a better understanding of the world and history in general, he set out to write an understandable and comprehensive world history children could enjoy. A Child's History of the World functions to familiarize young children with some historical events and people of significance while reading like a good story. The subjects are covered in chronological order, from the beginning of the world through the end of the Cold War. This gives the child a linear view of world history that allows the details to be filled in later. A Child's History of the World is a basic reader and is not intended to be used as a supplementary reader. Customer Reviews This is a must-have book. It is a complete and engaging curriculum that is easy to use and understand. My girls are so close in age I was able to use it with all three at once and they loved it. And it's inexpensive! Love the way it is written. Katrena R. from Shingle Springs, CA This is a great book. Everyone (elementary/primary aged) should have this book in their homeschooling library. My kids (ages 4-9) have all enjoyed this book. It is engaging and well written for young ones. There is a lot of information packed into this book and it is presented in a way that is not boring for kids. It is kind of like The Story of the World.

What does the writer enjoy doing at the club?	I think the Buddy Club is great. I really enjoy talking with the older students about school life and growing up. They can tell me a lot. One student told me how he relaxed before exams. Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English. The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami . We made paper planes, birds and hats together. The table tennis tournament was a great idea. I didn't do very well, but I learnt a lot from watching the doubles tournament won by a fourteen-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old boy. Last year, we had the annual Buddy Club Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the games we played. After I learnt how to fish, I caught two fish in the lake. I think it might be a good idea to change the Buddy Club Picnic to a weekend camping trip. We could learn how to put up tents and how to find our way through a forest. Many of the older students know how to do this already, and I think they would like to teach the younger students. I want to say again how much I enjoy the club. When I'm older, I will make friends with younger students. Then, I can tell them all about school life and growing up.	['Talking to older students.']
How does the author feel towards single-sentence-long novels?	"A crisis is on the way.Global warming? The world economy? No,the decline of reading.People are just not doing it anymore,especially the young.Who's responsible? What is responsible? The Internet,of course,and everything that comes with it--Facebook,Twitter,etc.. There's been a warning about the coming death of literate civilization for a long time.In the 20th century,first it was the movies,then radio,then television that seemed to end the written world.None did.Reading survived;in fact it not only survived,it has developed better.The world is more literate than ever before -- there are more and more readers.and more and more books. The fact that we often get our reading material online today is not something we should worry over.The electronic and digital revolution of the last two decades has arguably shown the way forward for reading and for writing.Interconnectivity allows for the possibility of a reading experience that was barely imaginable before.Where traditional books had to make do with photographs and illustrations,an e-book can provide readers with an unlimited number of links:to texts,pictures,and videos. On the other hand,there is the danger of trivialization .One Twitter group is offering its followers single-sentence-long""digests""of the great novels.War and Peace in a sentence? You must be joking.We should fear the fragmentation of reading.There is the danger that the high-speed connectivity of the Internet will reduce our attention span--that we will be incapable of reading anything of length or which requires deep concentration. In such a fast-changing world,in which reality seems to be remade each day,we need the ability to focus and understand what is happening to us.This has always been the function of literature and we should be careful not to let it disappear.Our society needs to be able to imagine the possibility of someone entirely in pace with modern technology but able to make sense of a dynamic,confusing world."

The best title of the passage may be _ .	"Oprah Winfrey is not just a very successful TV personality in the US, she is also a woman who has encouraged millions. For those people, her life and her success are a good example. She has struggled with many of the challenges that we all face, and she has changed her life. Her message is powerful: I did it, and so can you. Oprah Winfrey is a black woman whose becoming famous is an encouraging story. She was born on January 29, 1954 in a small village in America. Her patents were very poor. For her family, life seemed to hold no promise. But there was nothing that could stop Oprah. She was an extremely bright girl at school. She asked her kindergarten teacher to let her go to school sooner and she also skipped the second grade of primary school . Her life from the age of six till about fourteen was very hard. For many women such difficulty would be too heavy to bear . But not for Oprah. When she was fourteen, Oprah went to live with her father. Her father showed her how hard work and discipline could lead to self-improvement. Oprah listened to her father, and a few years later she won a college scholarship that allowed her to go to university. Two years later, after graduation, she started working for television. For more than ten years she worked for different TV stations across the country. In 1984, she moved to Chicago, where she became the host of a talk show called ""AM Chicago"". When Oprah started, ""AM Chicago"" had few listeners. By September of the next year, the show was so successful that it was given a new name: 'The Oprah Winfrey Show"". Oprah Winfrey's story encourages many people to believe that success and happiness in life are within reach for everyone."	['Oprah Winfrey']
What first inspired Mother Teresa to work in India?	Mother Teresa was born in Yugoslavia, on August 27th, 1910. She attended the government school near her home until she was eighteen. At that time, some doctors and nurses from Yugoslavia were working in India, and they often wrote to the school about their work. She decided to join them one day. When she finished school, she went first to Britain. Then a year later she went to India, where she began to train to be a teacher. After training, she was sent to Calcutta, where she taught geography at a school and soon after became headmistress . However, although she loved teaching, in 1946 Mother Teresa left the school and went to work in the poor parts of Calcutta. Later she trained to be a nurse in Panta, and then began her work helping the poor and comforting the dying in the streets of the city. Slowly, others came to help her, and her work spread to other parts of India. Mother Teresa is now a well-known person. Many photos have been taken of her, as she travels the world to open new schools and hospitals in poor countries. In 1979, she was given the Nobel Peace Prize for the lifetime of love and service she has given to the poor.	"[""The medical worker's letters to her school.""]"
The result of the auction would be the followings, except _ .	"The very wealthy English Baron Fitzgerald had only one child, a son, who understandably was the apple of his eye. His wife died when the child was in his early teens. So Fitzgerald devoted himself to (...) fathering the kid. Unfortunately the son died in his late teens. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald's wealth greatly increased. He spent a lot on art works of the masters . Later Fitzgerald himself became seriously ill. Before his death, he had carefully prepared his will as to how his wealth would be settled - to sell his entire collection at an auction . Because of the large quantity and high quality of his collection, a huge crowd of possible buyers gathered for the auction. Many of them were museum directors and private collectors eager to bid . Before the auction, the art works were shown, among which was a painting of Fitzgerald's son by an unknown artist. Because of its poor quality, it received little attention. When it was time for the auction, the auctioneer gaveled the crowd to attention. First the lawyer read from Fitzgerald's will that the first art work to be auctioned was the painting of his son. The poor-quality painting didn't receive any bidders, except one old servant who had served the son and loved him, and who for emotional reasons offered the only bid. As soon as the servant bought the painting for less than one English pound, the auctioneer stopped the bidding and asked the lawyer to read again from the will. The crowd became quiet, and the lawyer read from the will: ""Whoever buys the painting of my son gets all my collection."" Then the auction was over."	['Expected']
Generally speaking, most people feel happy because _ .	"Are you happy? Do you remember a time when you were happy? Are you seeking happiness today? Many have sought a variety of sources for their feelings of happiness.Some have put their hearts and efforts into their work.Too many have turned to drugs and alcohol.Meanwhile, untold numbers have looked for it in the possession of expensive cars, exotic vacation homes and other popular ""toys"".Most of their efforts have a root in one common fact: people are looking for a lasting source of happiness. Unfortunately, I believe that happiness escapes from many people because they misunderstand the journey of finding it.I have heard many people say that, ""I'll be happy when I get my new promotion."" Or ""I'll be happy when I lose that extra 20 pounds."" It is dangerous because it accepts that happiness is a ""response"" to having, being or doing something. In life, we all experience stimulus and response.Today, some people think that an expensive car is a stimulus, and happiness is a response; a great paying job is a stimulus, and happiness is a response; a loving relationship is a stimulus, and happiness is a response.This belief leaves us the thinking and feeling: I'll be happy when ... It has been my finding that actually the opposite is true.I believe that happiness is a stimulus and a response is what life brings to those who are truly happy.When we are happy, we tend to have more success in our work.When we are happy, people want to be around us and enjoy loving relationships.When we are happy, we more naturally take better care of our bodies and enjoy good health.Happiness is not a response but a stimulus. Happiness is a conscious choice we make every day of our lives.For unknown reason to me, many choose to be painful, unsuccessful and angry most of the time.Happiness is not something that happens to us after we get something we want--we usually get things we want AFTER we choose to be happy."

_ might serve as a suitable title for this selection.	A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are. It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats. Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous. But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows? We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.

Which of the following statement is NOT true according to the passage?	We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom, symbolizing an end as well as a beginning, signifying renewal as well as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears (ancestors) prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago. The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought are still at issue around the globe, the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe (enemy) alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge (promise solemny) and more. In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility. I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And so, my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the Freedom of Man. Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.

What most possibly drove the two gunmen away?	"My mind went blank when I saw the gun pointing against the car window as we pulled out of the garage. This can't be happening to me. Then I felt the gun, cold, against my head, and I heard my friend Jeremy saying, ""What do you want? Take my wallet,"" but at the time I thought of nothing. I remember being a little annoyed when the gunman pulled me from the car by the hair. I remember the walk to the house --- Jeremy, me, the two men with two guns. I remember the fear and anger in the gunmen's voices because Jeremy was being slow, and I remember wondering why he was being slow. I did not realize that Jeremy had thrown the keys into the bush. But I remember that sound of the gun hitting Jeremy's head and the feeling as the man who had hold of my hair released me. And I remember the split second when I realized he was looking at Jeremy, and I remember wondering how far I could run before he pulled the trigger. But I was already running, and upon reaching the car across the street, I didn't crouch behind it but screamed instead. I remember thinking there was something ridiculous and illogical about screaming ""Help, help!"" at eight o'clock on a Tuesday evening in December and changing my plea to the more specific ""Help, let me in, please let me in!"" But the houses were cold, closed, unfriendly, and I ran on until I heard Jeremy's screams behind me announcing that our attackers had fled. The neighbors who had not opened their doors to us came out with baseball bats and helped Jeremy find his glasses and keys. In a group they were very brave. We waited for the police to come until someone said to someone else that the noodles were getting cold, and I said politely, ""Please go and eat. We're O.K."" I was happy to see them go. They had been talking of stricter sentences for criminals, of bringing back the death penalty and how the President is going to clean up the country. I was thinking, they could be saying all of this over my dead body, and I still feel that stiffer sentences wouldn't change a thing. In a rush all the anger I should have felt for my attackers was directed against these contented people standing in front of their warm, comfortable homes talking about all the guns they were going to buy. What good would guns have been to Jeremy and me? People all over the neighborhood had called to report our screams, and the police turned out in force twenty minutes later. They were ill-tempered about what was, to them, much trouble about nothing. After all, Jeremy was hardly hurt, and we were hopeless when it came to describing the gunmen. ""Typical,"" said one policeman when we couldn't even agree on how tall the men were. Both of us were able to describe the guns in horrifying detail, but the two policemen who stayed to make the report didn't think that would be much help. The policemen were matter-of-fact about the whole thing. The thin one said, ""That was a stupid thing to do, throwing away the keys. When a man has a gun against your head you do what you're told."" Jeremy looked properly embarrassed. Then the fat policeman came up and the thin one went to look around the outside of the house. ""That was the best thing you could have done, throwing away the keys,"" he said. ""If you had gone into the house with them..."" His voice became weaker. ""They would have hurt her"" --- he twisted his head toward me - ""and killed you both."" Jeremy looked happier. ""Look,"" said the fat policeman kindly, ""there's no right or wrong in the situation. There's just luck."" All that sleepless night I replayed the moment those black gloves came up to the car window. How long did the whole thing last? Three minutes, five, eight? No matter how many hours of my life I may spend reliving it, I know there is no way to prepare for the next time --- no intelligent response to a gun. The fat cop was right. There's only luck. The next time I might end up dead. And I'm sure there will be a next time. It can happen anywhere, anytime, to anyone. Security is an illusion ; there is no safety in locks or in guns. Guns make some people feel safe and some people feel strong, but they're fooling themselves."	"[""The author's screaming""]"
What's the greatest support for teenagers?	Teenage life is interesting, adventurous and difficult. Teenagers have to go through many problems. It may probably be a family problem or a school problem. It is important to learn how to deal with those problems. Be grateful of your parents' support. When you have a problem, ask your parents to support you. When a child is thirteen, he feels like he has grown up. As a part of a family, teenagers do not want their parents to involve in their personal activities and they think they are able to be independent . It is very normal and parents should also cooperate with their kids. They should try to get to know what their child needs. Sometimes a child may be hesitating to tell something but they should try to know what the matter is. Parents' support is the greatest support for a teenager. Learn to live in society. Society plays a very important role in everyone's life. What teenagers see from society has a big influence on their characters. As a teenager, you should know what is wrong and what is right. Never be impatient in making a decision. Always keep cool and calm , take advice from your parents and you will make a good decision. Don't let the bad things of society influence you. Instead, get to learn good things from society. Learn from school. School is like a second home. We learn a lot from our school, and at the same time, it is the hardest part of a teenager's life. *First are the studies. You should know what you want to do. Don't come under pressure in making choices. *Learn to take your own stand . If you don't do well in exams, don't feel broken. Be strong-minded and spend more time on your studies. *Share your problems with your friends. Your friends are always ready to help. If you are confused in your life, talk about what all you've done and what you want to do with your friends.	['The support of their parents.']
In grocery stores where customers are served there is less impulse shopping. This may be because _ .	It has been found that less than one shopper in five makes a complete shopping list before going to the store. The reason for this is that seven out of ten of today's purchases are decided in the store, where the shoppers tend toward impulse buying. Buying groceries on impulse had risen for the past forty years, and this rise has coincided with the growth of self-service shopping. However, in grocery stores where clerks wait on customers there is much less impulse buying. It is hard for people to buy on impulse if they have to address a clerk. Psychologists have joined forces with merchandising experts. It is their job to persuade people to buy products which they may not need or even want until they see them attractively presented. It was discovered by the psychologists that shoppers want help in their purchases. Having so many choices confuses them, and they prefer the package that attracts them. Therefore, it is now more usual for food packers to pay attention to their package design. Attraction depends heavily on the position of the product on the shelf, however. Thus, persuading the shopper to buy is easier if the product is located at eye-level.	"[""customers hesitate to ask for help if they haven't decided what to buy""]"
What can be learned from the text?	"Chopsticks Brothers, China's Internet singing stars, will sing their hit Little Apple at the 2014 American Music Awards.

When the writer says that today it is the TV that rules, he means that the TV _ .	In the late 1500s, a large powerful gun was placed on top of the Signal Hill, in prefix = st1 /Newfoundland, to prevent attacks from the outside. Flags were also flown there to warn sailors of bad weather. It's fitting, then, the Italian Gulielmo Marconi should have chosen this site to receive the world's first radio signal -- in Morse code -- from England on December 12, 1901. Marconi, combining earlier ideas with his own, led us to a new communications age. For the next 50 years, until the appearance of television, radio ruled the air waves. Today, it's the TV that rules. No single person can say to have invented television. In 1884, the German Paul Nipkow invented a device that sent pictures mechanically , and in 1906, Boris Rosing, a Russian, used a ray and a disc to create the world's first TV system. Then in the early 1920s, another Russian, Vladimir Zworykin,invented a picture display tube. He took out a patent for color1 TV, even though it wouldn't be developed for another 25 years. In 1924, a Scot entered the scene -- John Logie Baird. He first succeeded in sending a moving picture and a year later got the first actual TV picture. In 1926, Baird showed TV in aLondonlaboratory. Two years later inNew York, Felix the Cat became the first TV star. TV excited everyone's imagination, but hardly anyone had a set, with just two thousand in use worldwide in the mid-1930s. Since the late 1940s, TV technology has developed very quickly. Computers may finally be combined with all televisions to give people a total all-in-one communications network. Today, it's possible to sit and watch TV in the middle of a forest or in the Arctic. It's surprising when one considers that Marconi was on Signal Hill in the same century.

In low income countries, _ .	"Controlling the Ebola virus outbreak at the source in West Africa is the most effective way to decrease international risk of transmission, according to a research paper. If the epidemic persists and grows, it's likely there will be more cases of the deadly virus exported to other countries, including Canada, via air travel, said Dr. Kamran Khan, a physician and researcher at St. Michael's Hospital. Dr. Khan, who examines global airline travel patterns to predict the spread of diseases, said that every month, three Ebola-infected travellers are likely to leave West Africa, which is experiencing a widespread outbreak of the virus -- and this number would only increase as the epidemic grows. Dr. Khan and his co-authors said it is essential that other countries, their public health agencies and hospitals should be prepared. The risk of international spread would be further _ if this epidemic were to take hold in other countries, especially those with weak public health systems. ""The international community must be mindful and be ready to support the early detection and control of cases."" Dr. Khan said. Dr. Khan noted that of the almost 500,000 travellers who flew on commercial flights out of Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in 2013, more than half were headed to destinations in five countries: Ghana (17.5 per cent, Senegal (14.4 per cent), the United Kingdom (8.7 per cent, France (7.1 per cent) and Gambia (6.8 per cent). More than 60 per cent of travellers from those countries in 2014 are expected to have final destinations in low- or lower-middle income countries. ""Given that these countries have limited medical and public health resources, they may have difficulty quickly identifying and effectively responding to imported Ebola cases"", said Dr Khan."

The Winter Olympics is held once _ .	People call the Winter Olympics the White Olympics. At this time, they publish many stamps to mark the great games. The first stamps came out on January 25th, 1932 in the United States for the 3rd White Olympics. From then on , publishing stamps during the White Olympics became a rule. During the 4th Winter Olympics, people published a group of stamps in November 1936. They drew five rings of Olympics. It was the first time that the rings appeared on the stamps of the White Olympics. In the 1950s,the stamps of this kind became more colorful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as non-host countries published stamps to mark those games. China also published four stamps in February 1980 when the Chinese sportsmen began to take part in the White Olympics. In Asia, Japan was the only country to hold the White Olympics. They sold 14,500 million stamps during the Olympics. People drew different kinds of sports on these small stamps, and they enjoyed the wonderful sports and some excellent players.

Why does Wayne live like a playboy?	"Superman, Spider-Man, Batman and Iron Man ... .There is no shortage of superheroes. You find them in comic books, on the TV and the big screen. In a survey of fans by the sci-fi and fantasy website, SFX.co.uk, Batman, 70 years old this year, was voted Britain's favorite superhero. Unlike many crime-fighting superheroes Batman has no special powers. He can't fly like Superman or shoot a sticky web like Spider-Man. Bruce Wayne is born to a wealthy Gotham City business family. However, when his parents are murdered his life changes completely. Wayne feels anger at their deaths and guilty that he did not prevent them. He travels around the world learning how to fight. Upon returning to Gotham, he creates a disguise to enable him to fight crime without being recognized. A childhood fear of bats leads him to choose to dress as one. His idea is that through the bat person he can prove to himself that he has overcome his childhood fears. Wayne is the CEO of the company he inherits from his father. He seems to live the lifestyle of a millionaire playboy. But this is a ruse . He works hard at the image to allow himself the freedom he needs to do his work as a crime fighter. ""Bruce Wayne, playboy"" is the disguise Batman is the real person. ""Wayne is not a born superhero. Instead, he is a real, complex person,"" said Dace Golder, editor of the website. ""He is the most realistic of all the superheroes. I am particularly interested in the emotional process by which a boy becomes a hero. His superhero qualities come from within."""

She thinks for a minute and then says, ""Yes, I know now, Doctor!When I marry , I am eighteen years old, and my husband is thirty. Now my husband is sixty. And that is twice thirty. So I am twice eighteen. That's thirty-six, isn't it?"""	['her']
Most students ride second-hand bicycles mainly because_.	Things you need to know about studying there Study style Since the 1950s, the Netherlands has had courses in English especially for foreign students. Students are expected to be critical of what they read and hear, and to be able of working independently. Foreign students will soon notice that at Dutch institutions for higher learning people are expected to do a lot of talking. The most common form of teaching is the seminar or working group, where a small group of students work under a teacher's supervision to analyze a certain problem. On exams, they have to show that they know the material, and that they have formed well-founded opinions on the subject. Accommodations If you are in an exchange programme or an international course, it is quite possible that a room will be arranged for you. Accept it immediately, or you will regret it later. That's because finding a place to live in a country as crowded as the Netherlands is not easy. Before you leave China, ask your host institution whether or not housing will indeed be arranged in advance. If you are in the Netherlands and still looking for a place, ask the international relations office or the student dean for advice. Expences Tuition: Bachelor's degree:about 2,500 euros a year Master's degree: 5,000-12,000 euros a year Living expenses: Experience has shown that a year in the Netherlands costs a Chinese Student about 450-700 euros a month. Here is a breakdown of average prices of supermarket goods: Litre of milk: 0.5--0.8 euro Kilo of apples: 1.5 euros Shampoo, 400ml: 4 euros Tube of toothpaste: 1 euro Bed sheet: 20 euros Other expenses: Haircut: 15 euros Air ticket to China: 600-800 euros Mobile phone call(one minute): 0.1-0.3 euro Phone call to China (with IP card): 7 euros(one minute) Postage stamp in the Netherlands: 0.39 euro Stamp for China: 0.78 euro (1 euro-about 10 yuan) Transportation Trains, buses and trams run throughout the country. If you really want to sample Dutch life, and get around quickly and easily, buy yourself a bicycle. Most students buy second-hand bicycles. A reasonable one will cost you 70-120 euros. You can find them at second-hand bicycle shops or at the bicycle parking facilities near railway stations.	['bicycles are convenient and cheap']
What makes grandpa so healthy?	My grandpa is 93 years old this year. He is very healthy and looks young. Many people ask him why he is so healthy. Grandpa says good diet is very important to everyone. Grandpa has three meals a day regularly . He often eats lots of vegetables and fruit. He never drinks or smokes . He says they are bad for health. After he gets up in the morning, he often drinks a cup of water. And before he goes to bed in the evening, he has a cup of milk.

Which of the following titles is best for this passage?	There are three kinds of goals: short-term, intermediate and long-term goals. Short-term goals are those that usually deal with present activities. Such goals can be achieved in a week or two, or possible months. It should be remembered that just as a building is no stronger than its foundation , our long-term goals cannot be achieved without the achievement of solid short-term goals. Upon completing our short-term goals, we should date the time and then add new short-term goals that will build on those that have been completed. The intermediate goals build on the foundation of the short-term goals. They might deal with just one term of school or the entire school years, or they could extend for several years. Any time you move a step at a time, you never allow yourself to become discouraged. As you complete each step, you will have more belief in your ability to grow and succeed. Long-term goals may be related to our dreams of future. They might cover five years or more. Life is not a static thing. We should never allow a long-term goal to limit us or our course of action.

What do you think of the author's mother?	"Have you ever had a day when everything seemed to go wrong, and nothing seemed to go right? Not too long ago I was having one of those days. I was discouraged, weary, and plain sad. My focus was on me. After all, no one else was experiencing the same trials I was. I expressed my upset state to my mother, hoping for some pity. Instead, she said, ""I heard Jamie was having a difficult day too. Why don't you make her some cookies and take them to her this afternoon?"" I didn't really want to, but decided that I didn't want to go back to my other problems just yet. I made the cookies and arranged them on a little plate. Then I made a card with a sunflower on it and wrote a small note of empathy. That afternoon I dropped by my friend's house. I went to the door and rang the bell. Soon, Jamie came to the door and looked at me in surprise for the unexpected visit. Before she could say anything I rushed, "" I heard you were having a hard day and decided to bring you something. I hope your day goes better."" The look that came over Jamie's face was one that I could never put into words. It was as if a darkened sky was suddenly lit with the golden rays of the sun; it was as if in that small act, her day was brightened. I got back into the car and for some amazing reason; I felt a lot better myself. That day I experienced the truth that James Barri attempted to describe, "" Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves."""	['Instructional.']
What's the best title of this passage?	"Once my father asked me to hold his hammer while he repaired something, so we could have some time to talk to each other. For 22 years, after I left home for college, he called me every Sunday at 9 am. He was always interested in my life and how my family was doing, and I never once heard him complain about his own life. Nine years ago when I bought my first house, my father, 67 years old, spent eight hours a day painting it for three days. He would not allow me to pay someone to have it done. All he asked for was a glass of iced tea and for me to hold a paint brush for him and talk to him. But I was too busy. Five years ago, at age 71, my father spent five hours putting together a swingset for my daughter. Again, all he asked was that I get him a glass of iced tea and talk to him. But again, I was too busy. Four years ago, my father drove all the way from Denver to Topeka, with an eight-foot Colorado blue spruce in his trunk, so that my husband and I could have a part of Colorado growing on our land. I was preparing for a trip that weekend and couldn't spend much time with him. Then, one day, my father telephoned me as usual, this time from my sister's home in Florida. We talked about the tree he had brought me, ""Fat Albert"", but that morning he called it ""Fat Oscar"", and he seemed to have forgotten some things. I had to get to church, so I cut the conversation short. The call came at 4:40 pm that day: my father was in hospital in Florida with an aneurysm . I got on a plane immediately, and on the way I thought of all the times I had not taken the time to talk to my father. I realized that I had no idea who he was or what his deepest thoughts were. I promised that when I arrived, I would make up for lost time. I arrived in Florida at 1 am. My father had passed away at 9:12 pm. This time it was he who did not have time to talk to me."

The scientist who has cloned a lamb successfully is from _ .	"A: Recently, the word ""clone"" appeared very often in the newspapers. Do you know its meaning? B: Not exactly, I read a report in yesterday's newspaper. It said there was a Scottish Dolly. It was the first time that a cloned lamb had been made from an adult sheep. A: Actually, the word ""clone"" means to produce the ""same"" animal by taking cells from an adult one, I think, if we know how to do cloning, we need only keep a small number of sheep, cows or horses. B: There's more to it. Recently there have been some people who ever want to clone humans. A: It seems interesting. But do you think it is possible to do that? B: No, I don't think so. First I think we cannot clone a dead person, because the cells in his body are dead already. A: Then we can clone a living person? B: Again no! You might clone yourself one after another, but it is only a replica , not real you. It is only something, not a human. A: Now, you mean that a real human can speak, think and create, and these abilities cannot be cloned? B: True enough! I think the main purpose of Dr. Lan Wilmot, the ""father"" of Dolly, is to make better animals. It has nothing to do with human cloning. ,."	['Scotland']
My Spanish friends wanted advice about _ .	"When I lived in Spain,some Spanish friends of mine decided to visit England by car,before they left,they asked me about how to find accommodation .I suggested that they should stay at ""bed and breakfast"" houses,because this kind of accommodation gives a foreign visitor a good chance to speak English with the family.My friends listened to my advice,but they came back with some funny stories. ""We didn't stay at bed and breakfast houses,""they said.""Because we found that most families were away on holiday."" I thought this was strange.Finally I understood what had happened My friends spoke little English,and they thought ""VACANCIES"" meant ""holidays"" because Spanish word for ""holiday"" is ""vacaciones"".So they did not go to houses where the sign outside said ""VACANCIES"",which in English meant there are free rooms.Then my friends went to houses where the sign said ""NO VACANCIES"",because they thought this meant the people who owned the house were not away on holiday.But they found that these houses were all full.As a result,they stayed at hotels! We laughed about this and about mistakes my friends made in reading other signs.In Spanish,a word very similar to ""DIVERSION"" means fun.In English it means that workman is repairing the road,and that you must take a different road when my friends saw the word ""DIVERSION"" on a road sign,they thought they were going to have fun.Instead, the road ended in a large hole. English people have problems too when they learn foreign languages.Once in Paris,when someone offered me some more coffee,I said ""Thank you"" in French.I meant that I would like some more.However,to my surprise the coffee pot was taken away! Later I found out that ""Thank you"" in French means ""No,thank you""."	['finding places to stay in England']
What do you think of the man?	"A long time ago, there was a man. He wanted to buy a pair of new shoes. He measured his feet with a straw ,and then went to a shoe shop in town. The shopkeeper took out a pair of new shoes, and let him try it on. But when he looked into his pocket, he found that the straw was not there. So he said, ""I'm sorry, I forgot to bring the size here! Let me go home to get it."" After that, he ran out of the shop. It was very far from his home to the shoe shop. When he got back home, he was out of breath. With a straw in his hand, he hurried to the shoe shop again. But the shop was closed. Someone near the man said, ""Your feet are with you. Why don't you try which pair of shoes fits ? And why do you believe your straw, but not your feet?"""	['Foolish.']
Why couldn't the author hold back her tears when she knew her daughter's idea?	"Last weekend, my kids along with a few other kids from the neighborhood volunteered to help me wash my car. My 10-year-old daughter came up with the idea of washing other people's cars as well. It was pretty hot outside. She further wanted to give juice for a low cost but not free. I felt happy and decided to help her. She asked me, ""What if we make this 'a smile car wash', mommy? ""I couldn't hold back my tears and encouraged her and other kids to go inside the house and come up with ideas. While I kept myself busy in drying the car, the kids walked up to me with a board of beautiful signs of smiles. They had ""Free Car Wash"" written on it and the theme of their exercise was ""Smile"". It was pretty natural to see a team of kids 5 to 11 years with the task to do something for others. All that seemed natural and came right from their heart. Nothing seemed to matter to them: their playtime, and then heat outside--they just wanted to help and do something nice in the community! I helped them make some fresh juice and brought out some waste materials to help clean cars. Passers-by were amazed and one even shouted at them saying ""Good kids"". One of them even tried giving them 5 dollars, which they refused. A pretty heart-warming scene! The following weekend, I saw the idea of the week, the theme of which was ""Global Kindness"". I was moved by such wonderful and loving souls. They made me smile! One of the slogans on their flag was: ""Do not fear! Smile retrievers are here."""

"Which statement best describes ""dress-down days""?"	"Being less than perfectly well-dressed in a business setting can result in a feeling of great discomfort that may well require treatment to eliminate (remove). And the sad truth is that ""clothing mismatches"" on the job can ruin the day of the person who is wearing the inappropriate attire --and the people with whom he or she comes in contact. Offices vary when it comes to dress codes. Some businesses have very high standards for their employees and set strict guidelines for office attire, while others maintain a more relaxed attitude. However, it is always important to remember that no matter what your company's attitude is regarding what you wear, you are working in a business environment and you should dress properly. Certain items may be more appropriate for evening wear than for a business meeting, just as shorts and a T-shirt are better suited for the beach than for an office environment. Your attire should reflect both your environment and your position. A senior vice president has a different image to maintain than that of a secretary or sales assistant. Like it or not, you will be judged by your personal appearance. This is never more apparent than on _ , when what you wear can say more about you than any business suit ever could. In fact, people will pay more attention to what you wear on dress-down days than on ""business professional"" days. Thus, when dressing in ""business casual"" clothes, try to put some good taste into your wardrobe choices, and recognize that the ""real"" definition of business casual is to dress just one notch down from what you would normally wear of business-professional attire days. Remember, there are borders between your career and our social life. You should dress one way for play and another way when you mean business. Always ask yourself where you are going and how other people will be dressed when you get there. Is the final destination the opera, the beach, or the office? Dress properly and you will discover the truth in the principle that clothes make the man--and the woman. Unless you are sure what to wear, it pays to dress slightly traditionally than the situation demands."	['People are usually more careful about what they wear on dress-down days.']
How did Mr. Bachmann influence the writer?	"My teacher, Mr. August J. Bachmann, was the most influential teacher I ever had. I had gotten into trouble in his class: Another student had pushed me for fun, and I became angry and began to hit him. Mr. Bachmann stopped the fight, but instead of sending me to the office, he sat me down and asked a simple question: ""Penna, why are you wasting your life? Why aren't you going to college?"" I didn't know anything about colleges or scholarships. No one had ever considered that a fatherless boy from the poorest neighborhood had a future. That day, instead of rushing off for lunch, he stayed and explained possible education options to me. At the end of our talk, he sent me to see a secretary who had a child at a state college. This was in 1962 at Emerson High School in Union City, New Jersey. Well, 53 years have passed, and what have I done with the knowledge he gave me? I gained a PhD from Fordham University when I was only 29. I taught English and social studies and then moved up the chain of command from teacher to principal. I've sat on the board for Magnet Schools of America and represented that organization at the United Nations. I've won a number of great educational awards. But where would I be if a truly caring teacher had not taken the time out of his lunch period to speak to me? It was without question only his confidence in me that helped me forward. I have repaid his kindness hundreds of times by encouraging misguided youngsters to aim higher. If I have saved any children, it is because of him. If I have been a successful educator, it is because I had a great role model in Mr. Bachmann."	['He set the writer on the right path.']
We can infer that the following part of the passage, Bonnie Beaver will focus on _ .	"When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff. Baby's Best Friend When Jennifer Merritt brought her baby, Arielle, home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: ""If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!""says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. u Introduce Them with Care Your newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: ""Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell."" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. To introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. u Learn the Safety Basics No matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate."	['other safety basics and rules']

This can happen if they are surprised or shocked by sudden news or by something they see suddenly. Some people faint if they see others hurt .Some people faint in crowds. Others faint if they are in a room that is hot and stuffy. If a person faints while standing, lay him down.

There are seven people in my family. They are my parents, my two sisters, my brother, his wife and I. In England, a family like this is a big one. My father has a factory . It isn't very big. It makes all kinds of boats. My brother is a doctor. He works in a hospital . His wife works in a hospital, too. She is a nurse. My two sisters are students. One wants to be a teacher.

Which word can best describe the man's initial reaction as soon as he was diagnosed with cancer?	I once had a friend that was diagnosed with terminal cancer , and the news that he might only live up to six months was a great shock to him, his family, and his friends.However, in spite of the serious illness, he was initially determined to look into all available treatments that might cure or extend his life.I think that when you find yourself in such situations, you tend to look up every possible way for hope of saving your life. As months went on and his health grew worse, I noticed an unexpected change in attitude that came over him.He had also been a happy person with a cheerful personality, but rather than give in to discouragement and self-pity, he took comfort in God and humanity .His talks focused on others rather than himself, and he spoke of the afterlife as something he was prepared for, believing that his concerned ancestors, including his mother and father, were there waiting for him. During the last few months, weeks, and days of his life, he was kindly cared for by family, friends, his loving wife, who looked after both his physical and emotional needs, and workers from a local hospice came to the home to regulate his medication and provide any other needed support.He didn't complain about his fate, and he willingly allowed others to serve him. Indeed, one might think why God allows death and suffering in our world, but for me, such experiences taught me to value family more and kindness for others.You often can't learn these important attributes in the lap of luxury , and perhaps, such an experience is the greatest and final gift the illness can give those left behind.

What is the main attraction of golf for business people according to the passage?	"Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime. Australian computer software designer Sarah Huang is seven months pregnant but still working full-time in her Bangkok office. She says the city is ""definitely a place I want to stay for the next five, ten years"". Nannies and home help are affordable, but high fees for quality secondary education have convinced Ms. Huang to return to Australia when her child reaches high school age."

The author wrote the passage for _ .	"Since Amy Chua took the world of Chinese parents by storm with her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, in 2011 it seems more Chinese mothers have turned into ""tiger moms"". Several young Chinese mothers are my friends. But rarely any of them is free for lunch or other activities, because they appear to have become their children's ""slaves"". One of these young mothers moved from Hebei province to Beijing just to get her daughter admitted to a private and very expensive kindergarten. She closed her booming business and her husband shifted his office to Beijing, where they have bought a house. Another young mother is divorced and always busy with her daughter's dance, piano or English class. And a couple, both professionals in high positions, left their jobs, sold their Beijing house and moved to Australia when their son started going to school. The offspring of tiger moms rarely play sports, exchange ideas with their peers , take part in social projects, clean their rooms or wash clothes. Since everything such children do is under the guidance of their protective mothers, they don't learn how to manage their time or plan a project. As such, their education is far from complete. They are unable to defend an idea--let alone come up with one--deal with opposing views, accept defeat or organize their life. Tiger moms want their children to be more competitive so that they can enter the best schools. But school is only one period in a person's life. What about real life? What kind of independence will these children have once they grow up? Today, children don't get the chance to discuss or choose what they want: learn to play the violin or piano; take up drawing or swimming. Their tiger moms decide for them. Ideally, parents should discuss with their children, give them a choice and explain to them that they will have to finish what they start. This would help children develop not only their judgment but also their sense of responsibility. The solution to this problem is total reform of the education sector. And the government knows that. But reform needs time. We can only hope the reform is completed before today's children become the ""sacrificed generation"". But we need to reform the existent mindset more than the education sector . Education is not only about memorizing books and taking exams. Therefore, we should stop seeing kindergartens as ""schools"", and ensure all schools have the same standards, and bookish knowledge is enriched by knowledge from other sources, from society and life itself. Mothers are not to be blamed for the present situation, for in their desire to provide the best education for their children they become victims of social trends. But let's hope the Chinese view of education will change, gradually if not rapidly, to the benefit of children, families and society as a whole. This is my wish on Mother's Day."	['Chinese mothers']
We can infer from the text that the author is a _ .	As for older people, some of the applications are hard to use because they didn't grow up with them. They don't have simple models of how it should work. They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls. And they think of e-mail as old-fashioned and slow. The reason why teens don't make phone calls seems to be that they don't know what to say. When they call they often pause for a while. On the other hand, texting is considered proper, and it's OK if you don't answer. You might have been distracted .It's not considered rude, but it's considered unusual if you're in this kind of voice conversation and simply stop talling.	['program designer']
N. Hamunayya has become famous because _ .	"Cotton farmers in some Indian villages are flooding to buy Coca-Cola and Pepsi, believing that the sugar in the fizzy drinks kills pests . Farmers say scientists advised them to mix pesticides with a sugary syrup to control pests, and they found the mixture cheaper and more effective than pure chemicals---- although soft drink makers and scientists dismissed the claims. N. Hamunayya, who has become famous in his village in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh, said his crop survived an attack of pests which had resisted other solutions. ""We found that all the colas had the same effect on pests. The pests became numb and fell to ground,"" he said.He said the drinks had all the elements they needed: they were cheaper, sticky, fizzy, and attracted ants, which swallowed the larvae( )of the pests. But Thirupathi Reddy, assistant director of the Regional Agri Research station, Guntur, says tests had denied such claims. "" We conducted some field trials on cotton crop at our research station. There were no increases of productivity or deaths of pests,"" he says. Statements from Pepsi and Coca-Cola said there was "" no scientific basis"" for this practice. But their sellers are enjoying booming sales. Mantan Wali, who sells soft drinks in 17 villages in the region, said sales increased , thanks to the farmers. "" For the 10 days between August and September I had booming business. Instead of just 30 cases ( each containing a dozen one-litre bottles) of cola I started selling almost 200 cases, "" he said. "" We expected the sales to fall suddenly after the argument over pesticide remains in the cola drinks. Now I have to keep extra stock for the cotton farmers, "" he said."	['He himself successfully used cola to kill pests and saved his crop.']
In the writer's opinion, no paper can possibly succeed without_.	"Visitors to Britain are sometimes surprised to learn that newspapers there have such a large circulation . For example, national newspapers, the ""Daily Mirror "" and the ""Daily express"" both sell about four million copies everyday. Most of British families buy a newspaper every morning and two or three on Sundays. Besides the national papers, there is, however, another branch of the British newspapers, local newspapers. Local newspapers have a weekly circulation of 13 million. Almost every town and county area has one. Nearly all them hold their own and many of them are very profitable . These papers are written almost entirely for readers interested in local events-births, weddings, deaths, council meetings and sports. Editors prefer to believe people who know the district well. A great deal of local news is regularly supplied by clubs and churches in the neighborhood. The editors must never forget that the success of any newspaper depends on advertising. But if the newspaper is well written and the news items have been carefully chosen to draw local readers, the business men will thank for the chance to keep their products in the public eyes."

How did the writer make his points clear?	In the past, going to a piano teacher was the most popular way to learn how to play the piano. You could get one-to-one teaching and have the opportunity to learn as much as the teacher knew. If you didn't have private lessons, you could still learn the piano, but you would have to teach yourself. This was easy for some, but very difficult for most. However, with technology developing today, there is at last another way that you can take piano lessons. You can take an online course. An online course is much cheaper than a private lesson. _ . You can take a whole online course in piano for just a fraction of the money that you would spend on weeks of private lessons. Also, private lessons are usually only one hour per week. So you would have to wait for your next lesson to continue your learning. However, online piano courses are quite different. With an online piano course, you can work at your own pace. You can also take as many lessons per week as you want, or go back and listen to your last lesson if you have forgotten anything. Most adults who want to learn how to play the piano enjoy being able to go back and listen to the lessons again. Of course if you need someone to sit beside you and offer you immediate feedback as you are playing, you might not get that from an online piano course. However, the lessons online can be viewed at any time, or as often as you'd like, which means that you can get your own type of feedback from an online piano course.

What would be the title for the passage?	Psychology tells us that many people hate to take risks. But it is good for us to take risks, especially when the risk is to achieve a desired result. In that way, we become stronger and braver. Our human nature should be to take risks, but some people just sit and wish they didn't have the fear to move on. This is because of one or two failures in their lives. Please step out and don't let the past hold you back from living life to the fullest. Move forward and move on! In studying the psychology of taking risks, we find that human nature provides us with the desire to experiment and take chances. Risk taking is a great benefit that allowed our ancestors to become stronger and stronger day by day. By taking risks they fought off enemies and discovered new territories . _ has become a part of our modern culture. Riding a roller coaster is a common risk taking activity that even the average person seems to enjoy although they have the understanding that it is dangerous. This psychological and biological connection creates an interesting connection between what is unsafe and what humans enjoy. Getting in a car each day is a risk. Getting out of bed is a risk. There is such thing as perfect safety. We need to take risks so that we can complete (finish) many things. Astronauts take risks when they get inside a rocket; however, the things they achieve are great. Businessmen take a risk when they buy parts of a company. However, without doing that, they could not make more money. We need to take risks so that we can gain something. It is impossible to move forward in life, earn money, enjoy a relationship, play a sport, or do anything else without taking a risk. It is all part of the game. It's one of the most important parts of life.	['No risk, no gain.']
People who go to the carnival with children are advised _ .	Must-Read about Notting Hill Carnival Route The carnival procession itself begins at 9am on both Sunday and Monday. It starts on Great Western Road, winding its way along Chepstow Road, then on to Westbourne Grove, and then down Ladbroke Grove. See our Notting Hill Carnival map for the full route. Bus While extra services will be in operation, no buses will enter the Carnival area from first thing Sunday morning until the first service on Tuesday morning. On both days bus services begin from Notting Hill Gate in the south and from Harrow Rd (close to Elgin Avenue) in the north. Bike Last year the nearest bike-parking stations - Chepstow Villas and Pembridge Road - were removed for Carnival, so don't rely on being able to park your bike nearby this year. Safety Avoid carrying expensive items, such as jewellery and digital cameras. Take a bag with a secure zip to keep your more valuable possessions in and avoid putting your valuables in your back pocket. Do tell police if you see an incident. Officers will be stationed throughout the Carnival area. Don't try to walk against the flow of the crowd, as you won't get far. Drink plenty of water on the day too, especially if the sun makes an appearance. Children Children's Day on Sunday is recommended for families as the smaller crowds and kid-friendly floats create a fun atmosphere. Arrange meeting points in case you become separated. The smaller the buggy , the better. Ear defenders may be necessary for very young children.	['to be there on Sunday']
Who helped the abbot out of his trouble?	"There was once a rich old _ ) in England who lived a very rich life. When King John, who was the worst king that England ever had, heard of the way in which the abbot lived, he decided to stop it. So he sent for the old man and said, ""Your fault is clear, and unless you can answer me three questions within two weeks, your head shall be cut off, and all your money shall be mine. Firstly, you must tell me just how long I shall live. Secondly, you must tell me how long I shall ride round the whole world, and lastly, you shall tell me what I think."" The abbot went to Oxford and Cambridge for help but not one of the teachers in the great schools could. At last, sad and sorrowful, he rode towards home. Then he met his shepherd and told him all that had happened. ""Cheer up, good master. I think I can help you out of your trouble."" The shepherd dressed himself up with great care and looked just like the abbot. Then he went to the king. ""How long shall I live?"" ""You will live until the day that you die, and not one day longer."" ""How long shall I ride round the world?"" ""You must rise with the sun, and you must ride with the sun until it rises again the next morning. As soon as you do that, you will find that you have ridden round the world in twenty-four hours."" ""What do I think?"" ""You think that I am the abbot. But, to tell you the truth, I am only his poor shepherd, and I come to beg your pardon for him and for me."" The king laughed long. ""Very well then, you have won the old abbot a free pardon from King John for this joke."""	"[""The abbot's shepherd.""]"
According to the passage, the hostess cooks dinner herself mainly because _ .	A characteristic of American culture that has become almost a tradition is to respect the self-made man -- the man who has risen to the top through his own efforts, usually beginning by working with his hands. While the leader in business or industry or the college professor occupies a higher social position and commands greater respect in the community than the common laborer or even the skilled factory worker, he may take pains to point out that his father started life in America as a farmer or laborer of some sort. This attitude toward manual labor is now still seen in many aspects of American life. One is invited to dinner at a home that is not only comfortably but even luxuriously furnished and in which there is every evidence of the fact that the family has been able to afford foreign travel, expensive hobbies, and college education for the children; yet the hostess probably will cook the dinner herself, will serve it herself and will wash dishes afterward, furthermore the dinner will not consist merely of something quickly and easily assembled from contents of various cans and a cake or a pie bought at the nearby bakery. On the contrary, the hostess usually takes pride in careful preparation of special dishes. A professional man may talk about washing the car, digging in his flowerbeds, painting the house. His wife may even help with these things, just as he often helps her with the dishwashing. The son who is away at college may wait on table and wash dishes for his living, or during the summer he may work with a construction gang on a highway in order to pay for his education.

"What are the ""two birds"" that the city government kills with only one stone?"	"Goats are being hired to do the work of men in a neighborhood just outside of San Diego. The fires that occurred in Hillborough four years ago destroyed thirty homes, most of which have been rebuilt. While the home were rebuilt, the grasses, bushes, and shrubs were re-growing. The area is now so overgrown in brush that it again brings a major danger of fire. The city government asked for bids to remove the brush. The lowest bid they received was $50,000. And that was if the city provided breakfast and lunch for the work crews for the six weeks it would take to clear the overgrown area. The city government said no, offering unlimited coffee and a doughnut a day for each crew member. When that offer was rejected, the city asked for help on its website. A sheepherder in Montana and a goat-herder in San Bernardino read about the city's problem while surfing the web on their laptops. They both offered to do the job for $25,000. The government chose the goat-herder because he lived closer. When told that the city dump was overflowing, the goat-herder said, ""No problem. My goats will eat everything in your dump. Except for the automobile engines, of course."" So, for another $5,000, the city killed two birds with one stone. If all goes well, they will invite the goat-herder and his ""family"" back every three years. The goat-herder said he will probably visit San Diego while his goats are in the dump. ""I want to go there by plane; I just hope we don't crash. My goats would miss me a lot,"" he said."	['The danger of fire in a neighborhood and the overflowing dump.']

Which of the following statements is correct according to the passage?	"Years after throwing a bottle-up note into a lake for a class project and just one year after his death, a man's childhood message was found and returned to his mother. Eleven years ago, a then 10-year-old boy, Joshua Baker, wrote the message, folded and put it in an empty container, his mother, Maggie Holbrook said. He died last February in a motor vehicle accident in California. He had recently returned after a serving in the Middle East as a US marine. ""I think he was just letting us know he was OK and keep doing what we are doing."" Holbrook said. The message surfaced in White Lake in late April, just days after the 11th anniversary of its being thrown into the lake. It was found by one of Baker's closest friends, Steve Lieder, she said. Lieder and two friends were chatting near the lake when Lieder looked down and saw the bottle. He broke it open and found the note inside. ""My name is Joshua Baker. I am 10. If you find this, put it on the news. The date is 4/16/98."" They immediately took it to Holbrook, who said she is now having the note preserved and will display it in her home. She can remember when her son wrote the message for the school project. She said she always wondered why he didn't put it in the nearby Wolf River, which has a much stronger current. ""I still remember the day he wrote it, "" Holbrook said. ""I couldn't understand why he threw I in the lake. No one would never see it again. Now I know."""

Why did Julia launch an online petition?	"""I feel fat."" ""I hate my hair."" ""I wish I were taller."" Julia Bluhm, 14, was sick of hearing comments like these. Many girls she knew seemed to worry too much about their appearance -- their weight, skin, hair, even the shape of their faces. So Julia decided to do something about it. Her target? Seventeen, a popular girls' magazine. ""I look at the pictures, and they just don't look like girls I see walking down the street,"" the eighth-grader from Maine told The New York Times. Of course they don't. Magazines use programs like Photoshop to remove zits , add shine to hair, and slim waistlines. Often, girls are made to look like Barbie dolls. Julia fears that these impossible standards of beauty make teens feel terrible about their own appearances. After all, even the models aren't as perfect as they look in print! So Julia launched an online petition asking Seventeen to put at least one unaltered photo in each issue. ""I want to see regular girls that look like me in a magazine that's supposed to be for me,"" she wrote. Days later, her petition had thousands of signatures. Julia and her mom traveled to New York City and joined a demonstration in front of Seventeen' s offices. Then they were invited to meet with Seventeen's editor-in-chief, Ann Shoket. A few months later, Shoket announced that the staff of Seventeen had signed a ""Body Peace Treaty."" They promised to ""never change girls' body or face shapes"" and only use photos of ""real girls and models who are healthy."" In addition, they promised to be more open about the ways in which images are changed before publication. Julia's fight against teen self-hate is far from over, but for now it seems she's winning -- and she's thrilled. ""This is a huge victory,"" she wrote in a message on her petition page. ""I'm so unbelievably happy."""	['To fight for real beauty.']

We can learn from the story that _ .	"One Sunday evening, it was quite dark when old Stanley went for his walk.

What would be the best title for the text?	"When the Apollo astronauts landed on the Moon in 1969, millions of people were rather sad. The person to blame for this was an artist named Chesley Bonestell. For many years, Bonestell had been creating beautifully detailed paintings of the Moon and planets. Viewers of his artwork were unhappy because the real Moon did not look like Bonestell's pictures of it. As a space artist, Bonestell tried to make his drawings look exciting and as true as the Moon is. He worked closely with astronomers and scientists to get the most up-to-date scientific information available. But in the 1940s and 1950s, no one had ever seen another planet up close. Yet Bonestell's paintings looked so real that some people thought they were photographs. Even though Bonestell was interested in astronomy, he did not start out as a space artist. As a young man he studied architecture -- the art and science of designing and making buildings. In 1938 Bonestell became a special effects artist in Hollywood. It was here that he learned he could improve his paintings by following the methods used in the movies. In 1944, a popular magazine published a series of Bonestell's paintings of the planet Saturn. He drew Saturn as if it were seen by someone standing on each of the planet's moons. The results were _ . Within a few years, Bonestell's artwork was appearing regularly in magazines and books on astronomy and space flight. Many of Bonestell's artworks had been right all along. But the biggest surprise was the Moon. Someone asked Bonestell what he was thinking when he saw the first pictures from the Moon. ""I thought how wrong I was!"" he said. ""My mountains were sharp , and they aren't on the Moon."" But he shouldn't have felt bad. No space artist had ever before taken so many people to so many faraway worlds. In the years just before the first manned space flights, Bonestell's artwork prepared people for the amazing space adventure to come."	['The space art of Chesley Bonestell']

Laura: You know, people in the city are longing for the life in the countryside. It reduces my work pressure . Besides, it gives me the exciting experience of being a ""thief"".

"What's the similarity between ""tuhhao"" and ""dama""?"	"China's new popular word, ""tuhao"", may be taken in next year's Oxford English dictionary. The word caught the attention of the dictionary's editing team after BBC's recent program on influential Chinese words. ""If its influence continues, it is very likely to appear on our updated list of words,"" said Julie Kleeman, project manager with the editing team. Kleeman told the Beijing Youth Daily that ""tuhao"" has some similarities with the English word ""bling"", which refers to expensive, ostentatious clothing or jewelry. Both the two words have existed for long but later on took a new meaning. In Chinese, ""tu"" means rude and ""hao"" means rich. It has traditionally been referred to rich people who throw their weight around in China's rural areas. In recent years, people in the ACG (anime, comic and game) circle borrowed the term to describe those who spend money in an unreasonable manner. The word gained acceptance in September with the launch of Apple's new gold-colored iPhone, an item loved by China's nouveau riche . The color became known as ""tuhao gold"".The word is now often used by the online community to refer to people who have the cash but lack the class to go with it. Kleeman also mentioned another Chinese word ""dama"" which may also be taken in the dictionary. ""Dama"", meaning middle-aged women, was first used in the Western media by the Wall Street Journal in May when thousands of Chinese women were buying up record number of gold. They were the driving force in the global gold market between April and June when the gold prices had dropped. ""People can have an intuitive grasp of the meanings if they see pinyin"", Kleeman said adding that people avoided using an English word to keep the original meaning. The new words will be first uploaded on the official website before the dictionaries arrive. The online version is also renewed every three months."	['Both take new meanings.']
What do we learn from the passage?	Dear Cary, I'm writing because I've understood you've struggled with alcoholism . I've been fighting mine ever since I went through 9-11.

""I am so exhausted from so many social activities, which made me even more tired than training,"" said the 21-year-old Liu, who wrote a new chapter in China's Olympic history by winning the country's first ever athletics short-distance running title in the men's 110m hurdles in Athens in August. ""I am happy that I will resume my training soon back in Shanghai,"" said the Shanghainative. He turned into an instant national hero with the Olympicglory(,)and one of the most popular Olympic gold medalists, taking part in scores of celebration activities since he returned to China early September. ""My regular training has been interrupted for such a long time that I think I can only run at about 13.5 seconds now,"" said Liu, who clocked a world record-tying time of 12.91 to clinch the title. ""I would rather forget what I have achieved in the past and try my best to realize a higher goal,"" he said. Liu already missed the Berlin Golden League Series on Sunday and won't be able to catch the IAAF Grand Prix final slated for September 18-19 in Monaco. He plans on attending an IAAF all-star tournament in Japanat the end of this month."	['Liu Xiang has missed two races because of his social activities.']
What did the writer do in the village at night?	My summer holiday began on July 5th. I didn't want to stay at home and did nothing in the hot summer. I called my grandma, and she asked me to go to her village. I was very happy with it. After four hours, I got to my grandma's house by bus. There are many trees around her house. I liked to play games with other children during the day. At night, people in the neighborhood often came and sat together to chat. My grandma liked telling stories. My new friends and I enjoyed her stories very much. There is a pool in the village. My friends and I often went there with some food and _ fish in the pool. Then we cooked the fish and had dinner there. It was not easy to catch fish, but it was interesting and exciting. I stayed there for about a month, and then I went back home.

What do Ownes' friends think about him?	"He has vowed that he will not stop building his business until it is worth PS100 million.But hard-working Owens can stop for at least a moment's celebration after making his first PS1 million at the age of 16.Owens,who has used a computer since the age of seven,began teaching himself basic web design at the age of ten when he was given his first Mac computer.He used his pocket money to fund his first business project,website Mac Box Bundle at just 14 which has made PS700 000 since its establishment in 2008.Mac Box Bundle sells a combination of popular Mac applications which are worth up to $400 together for under just $100 and donates 10 percent of the money to charities. He then established an advertising company Branchr a year later and worked on the business after school and at weekends.Branchr made a surprising PS500 000 in its first year.Branchr works as a platform for website owners to sell advertising. Owens,from Northampton,currently employs eight staff--all adults--around the UK and America as sales and technical assistants.The young man lives with his parents.His mother who is a company secretary said he was inspired to go into business after observing the huge success achieved by Apple's chief executive officers Steve Jobs. Owens said,""I think everyone has business sense in them,and they just need to gain experience and be determined to make it.There is no magical formula for business.It takes hard work,determination and the drive to do something great.My aim is to become a leading name in the world of Internet and mobile advertising and push myself right to the top of the game.

This passage is mainly about _ .	"Picture the scene: the battery on your mobile phone has run out. You can't make any calls for help and no one can contact you. You are all alone - well, not quite. Just reach into your pocket and take out a piece of sugar.Put it into the battery, wait a minute, and you're back on the phone. Thanks to a couple of American scientists, this situation could become real.Swadesh Chaudhuri and Derek Lovely have invented the ""bacteria battery"" - powered by bacteria that eats sugar and turns it into electricity. ""This is a special organism,"" Lovely said.""You ean harvest enough electricity to power a cell phone battery for about four days from a spoonful of sugar."" In the past, bacteria batteries have been expensive and not long-lasting. But this battery uses more efficient bacteria that can turn 80 percent of sugar into electrical energy. This is 30 percent more than similar batteries can manage. The bacteria battery could become as small as a household battery. It's also cheap and stable, as sugar can be taken from waste and crops. But the sugar to electricity process is slow: it could take weeks for the bacteria to digest a cup of sugar.And it produces ""greenhouse"" gases which pollute the environment. The scientists understand there is a lot more work to be done. ""It is still young,"" said Lovely.""Where we are now is where solar power was 20 0r 30 years ago."" But he believes the battery could be used in scientific equipment at the bottom of the ocean.Other ideas include using sugar in the blood to run medical devices in the human body, and taking sugar from animal waste to provide energy to power homes in rural areas."

According to the writer, the artists love street art because _ .	"Street art can be found on buildings, street signs and even dustbins from Tokyo to Paris to New York City. This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a culture which can be seen around the world. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their ""tag"" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. What they enjoy most is the freedom of expressing themselves which street art permits . One well-known street artist is Swoon. She cuts out paper images of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start her career as a street artist. She studied art but, as time went on, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's strong and interesting style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Nowadays street art has become part of a world-wide culture. It is supported by websites, artist groups, books and magazines."	['they want to express their feelings freely']
Which of the following is WRONG?	"Mails, games, music, news, chat rooms and shopping! The Interent is part of our life today. It's easy to get onto the Internet. The only thing we need to do is to use a modem which is used for connecting a computer to a telephone line. The Internet is changing and growing all the time. More and more people have computers and use the Internet. Using the Internet means surfing the World Wide Web(That's the ""WWW"" you always hear about). The Internet has a large number of websites . They are the places where you go to get information and do things. Where do these websites come from? They are made by web designers. What happens when you click on a word or a picture? You are sent to another page. It's all because of the web designers. Web designers do a lot of work by using a computer programming language. Is web design all about computer programming? No, it's about making something new. Web designers must imagine a lot when they are making a website. It must look good and be fun to use. A big part of web design is art. They choose the best pictures and colors to make the website look good. They also write the things that you see on the website. An important part of their job is to share ideas with the website manager about how to design the website well."	"[""There're a few websites on the web.""]"
It can be inferred that _	When many people are worried that there are no more heroes in the modern era two university students who lost their lives to rescue drowning children have shown that heroes still exist . According to the Inner Mongolia Morning Post, the tragedy occurred on the afternoon of December 14, 2002 when three school students skating on a frozen lake in Qingcheng Park in Hohhot fell through the ice into the freezing water. More than 20 university students who happened to be near the spot immediately went to the rescue of the children. Two children were quickly rescued, but the third died. The child's body was not found for three hours. Two of the rescuers, Liu Ye and Hao Longbiao, also died of cold and exhaustion . The body of Hao and who took the lead in jumping into the lake was not found until the next day. A student who was unwilling to tell his name said he and his classmates from the local college were taking photos at the lake. When they heard the children's cries for help, they went to the ice hole hand in hand to rescue the children. But the ice kept breaking, causing most of then to fall into the icy water. Local residents held mourning ceremonies at the lake. Eight of the students were seriously affected by the freezing water and were being kept in hospital for further observation, but their lives were no longer in danger.	"[""the ice on the lake wasn't strong enough to skate on""]"
The best title for the passage is _ .	"When you have a question about something, where do you go? For many people the answer is simple as they can go online to a search engine like Google or Yahoo. But what about people in rural or underdeveloped areas who may have no way to get on the Internet? A business and international development professor in California, Rose Shuman, found an answer for them: Question Box. Question Box is a service that provides answers---free of charge---for people who cannot search the Internet directly. The users of Questions Box might be those who might not be able to read, or simply have no access to the Internet. Question Box began three years ago in India. People used a metal call box with a push-to-talk button to connect a live operator. Rose Schuman explained,"" You just need to push a big green button on the box which will connect you directly to our operators who are sitting in front of computers, and speak your language. You can ask them any sort of question you want, and they'll look it up in English or in Hindi, or whatever the main language is, and translate the answer back for you."" The service is currently offered in two villages. The latest version of the box uses mobile phone technology, and solar panels in case the electrical power fails. Rose Shuman says the aim was to make the box as easy as possible for users, ""It is very efficient . Rather than try to bring a lot of difficulties to them and expect them to spend a lot of time to learn how to use the Internet, the idea was to make a technology that even Grandma could use."" In April 2009, Question Box was introduced to Uganda. Forty community workers with mobile phones connected villagers to call center operators in Kampala. The community workers went around telling people about the service. They wore T-shirts that said ""Ask me."" But Internet service in Uganda proved slow and undependable. So Question Box teamed up with a local technology company to store information on a local server. That way, the researchers in Kampala could quickly search the database for answers."

On the eve of lunar New Year, Chinese people stay up late and eat dumplings because	"The Chinese New Year is the most important festival for the Chinese people. It usually comes in January or February. It takes about 15 days to prepare for it. On the eve of the festival, people close the shops and stay at home. They all get together for a big dinner. They stay up late and enjoy dumplings at midnight for good luck. In the morning, people dress in their best clothes, and usually the old stay at home, the young go out to pay a New Year Call . It is an important time for the young. The young people bow to the old people. The Chinese call this ""Ke Tou"". This means ""touching the ground with the forehead "". Then the young people give their best wishes to the old people. The old people give children gifts or lucky money. They are very polite and do not use bad words on the Spring Festival Day. It,s the most important day of the year."	['they want to get good luck']
The information reported in the text was first got from _ .	"Mona Lisa, the mysterious woman in Leonardo da Vinci's 16th century masterpiece, had just given birth to her second son when she sat for the painting, a French art expert said on Tuesday. The discovery was made by a team of Canadian scientists who used special infrared and three-dimensional technology to study the paint layers on the work, which now sits in the Louvre museum in Paris. Bruno Mottin of the French Museums' Center for Research and Restoration said that on very close examination of the painting it became clear that the Mona Lisa's dress was covered in a thin transparent gauze veil. ""This type of gauze dress was typical of the kind worn in early 16th century Italy by women who were pregnant or who had just given birth. This is something that had never been seen up to now because the painting was always judged to be dark and difficult to examine,"" he told a news conference. ""We can now say that this painting by Leonardo da Vinci was painted in memory of the birth of the second son of Mona Lisa, which helps us to date it more precisely to around 1503.""The young woman with the ambiguous half smile has been identified as Lisa Gherardini, wife of Florentine merchant Francesco de Giocondo. She had five children. ""People always wrote that Mona Lisa had allowed her hair to hang freely over her shoulders. This greatly surprised historians because letting your hair hang freely during the Renaissance was typical of young girls and women of poor virtue ,"" he said. The team had hoped to discover more details about Leonardo's painting techniques, which the artist used to create a hazy effect. But scientist John Taylor said the team had been disappointed by the lack of brush stroke detail on the painting."	['a news conference']

From this passage, we know that Diao Weihao and his classmates are _ .	"Diao Weihao, a student who studies business English at the Chengdu campus of Sichuan International Studies University, was in his dormitory when the earthquake struck at 2:30 pm on Monday. The 22-year-old felt that his chair was shaking. All of a sudden, the textbooks on the bookshelf began to fall to the floor. The glass in the window broke. ""It felt like our dormitory building was being hit by a tractor,"" recalled Diao. ""I wasn't afraid.. I was even excited and curious. Now, looking back, it was a scary experience."" Diao and his roommates kept their calm. They didn't try to get out of the building until the shaking stopped. They were on the fifth floor and they feared there might be trouble if they didn't remain calm. ""We've watched lots of disaster films, and that helped us keep cool,"" he said. ""Only one student sprained his ankle. He was escaping in a hurry. Most of us got outside quickly and safely."" They were surprised to see so many students outside. ""I began to realize then what had happened,"" he said. The college had warned them that in the event of an earthquake, they should leave the dormitory immediately. A few did rush in when it was safe to grab some clothes to keep warm. Without any tents or bedding, the students stayed on the football field for the whole night. Rain started falling in the morning, but the students all kept in good order. They simply chatted and shared their feelings and comforted each other. ""Our students seemed to have self-control,"" he said. ""I heard that hospitals in Chengdu have lots of injured people who jumped out of buildings."" Now, Diao is mostly worried about the people in Wenchuan County. ""It seems we won't be able to have classes in one or two day's time,"" said Diao. ""I want to become a volunteer at the damage-hit area, or donate my blood to the injured people in hospital. Also, I will write on my blog to keep people calm and encourage them to protect themselves during emergencies."" Since the university is close to Dujiangyan, Diao and his classmates are still forbidden to return to their dorms or classrooms. However, they can eat in the canteen and get information about other parts of Sichuan by reading the newspapers."	['wise and caring']
Which of the following is NOT true?	In Britain you're allowed to drive a car when you're seventeen. You have to get a special two-year driving license before you can start. When you're leaning, someone with a full license always has to be in the car with you because you aren't allowed to drive the car on the road alone. You don't have to go to a driving school --- a friend can teach you. The person with you isn't allowed to take money for the lesson unless he's got a teacher's license. Before you're allowed to have a full license, you have to take a driving test. You can take a test in your own car, but it has to be fit for the road. In the test you have to drive round for about half an hour and then answer a few questions. If you don't pass the test, you're allowed to take it again a few weeks later if you want to. In 1970 a woman passed her fortieth test after 212 driving lessons! When you've passed your test, you don't have to take it again, and you're allowed to go on driving as long as you like. Britain's oldest driver was a man who drove in 1974 at the age of 100. Before 1904 everyone was allowed to drive, even children. Then from 1904 car drivers had to have a license. But they didn't have to take a test until 1935. On the early days of car driving, before 1878, cars weren't allowed to go faster than four miles an hour and someone had to lead the car with a red flag.	"[""A car driver didn't have to get a license until 1935.""]"
What can we learn about Pullman?	"Philip Pullman spent a great deal of his childhood traveling abroad because both his father and stepfather were pilots in the Royal Air Force . As a child, he went on several long ocean voyages, and he lived in Africa and in Australia. ""Before I was 11 I had been to eight different schools."" ""In Australia, I made a great discovery. TV hadn't reached Australia yet, but everyone listened to the radio. I remember listening to gangster serials , and cowboy serials, and best of all--Superman! When I first saw a superman comic , it changed my life. I'd been reading books for a long time, but I'd never known comics before. Soon afterwards, I discovered Batman, too, whom I loved even more."" Pullman started writing his first novel the day after he had finished his final exams at Oxford University. ""I discovered after about an hour that it was much harder than I'd expected. It still is! I found that the amount I could write comfortably every day was about three pages, so that's what I've done ever since."" Before he became a full-time writer, Pullman had been teaching for many years. ""What I enjoyed most during that time was telling stories over and over, until I knew them as well as I knew my own life."" He had always loved telling stories--as a schoolboy he had entertained his friends by reading stories to them, or by making up his own. One day he got a letter that had arrived at his door even though the writer of the letter didn't know his address. The envelope just said, ""Philip Pullman, The Storyteller, Oxford."""

The son did not translate the words his father said because _ .	"About 1966 or so, a NASA team doing work for the Apollo moon mission took the astronauts near Tuba City. There the land of the Navajo Reservation looks very much like the lunar surface. Among all the trucks and large vehicles were two large figures that were dressed in full lunar space suits. Nearby, a Navajo shepherd and his son were watching the strange creatures walk about, occasionally being watched over by other NASA workers. The two Navajo people were noticed and approached by the NASA people. Since the shepherd and his son did not know English, they asked the NASA people who the strange creatures were. The NASA people told them that they were just men that were getting ready to go to the moon. The shepherd became very excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. The NASA officials thought this was a great idea so they provided a tape recorder. After the man gave them his message, they asked his son to translate. His son would not. Later, they tried a few more people on the Navajo Reservation to translate and every person they asked would chuckle and then refuse to translate. Finally, with cash in hand someone translated the message, ""Watch out for these guys, they have come to take your land!"""	['his father was sending a warning against the NASA people']
If you are a film star fan, which city would you like to visit among the three?	Have you ever been to some big cities in the world? The information below will be helpful to you. Budapest For many centuries, Budapest was two cities, with Buda on the west side of the river Danube and Pest on the east side. Budapest became one city in 1872, and it has been the capital city of Hungary for about eighty years. The population of Budapest is about three million, and the city is a very popular place for tourists. Visitors like to take boat rides along the Danube. Budapest is also known for its exciting nightlife. The best time to visit is summer since Budapest is very cold in winter. Los Angeles Los Angeles was founded in 1781. With 3.5 million people it is now the biggest city in California and the second largest city in the United States. It is famous for its modern highways, its movie stars, and its smog. When the city is really smoggy, you can't see the near-by Mountains. The weather is usually dry and warm. Visitors like to go to the film studios and to drive along Hollywood Street. There are many good beaches near the city, and Los Angeles is also close to Disneyland. Taipei Since the founding of Taipei in the 18th century, the city has grown to a population of 2.3 million. Taipei is an exciting city, but the weather is humid and not always pleasant. It's also a very busy city, and the streets are always full of people. There is an excellent museum that many people visit. Taipei is quite an expensive city, but not more expensive than some neighboring cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo. So more and more travelers go to Taipei to shop.	['Los Angeles']

Where does this text probably come from?	"$? While the 2008 Olympics were the first to be broadcast entirely in HD, the 2012 Olympics are the first to broadcast in HD as well as 3D. Sean Taylor, a spokesperson for Panasonic - provider of some of the technologies - said it effectively, ""Each Games, from a technology perspective, tries to have a first. London will be the first HD and 3D Games."" The games were first televised in Berlin in 1936 and played on big screens about the city. Then came the first games to enter households (strictly in London that is) in 1948, followed by the first internationally televised games during the 1960 Olympics in Rome. And ever since, that feeling of physically standing in the crowd and watching these mighty contestants has only gotten clearer, more defined. Now, they more literally than ever actually compete in your living room. SS A _ is presented as the London games celebrate both the Industrial Revolution (a.k.a. the birth of pollution) and a spirit of committed environmentalism; London will be the first to actively measure its own carbon footprint during these games, designing a stadium and accommodations that cut-back on negative emissions when at all possible. They are also shooting for a world record via the ""Javelin,"" designed specifically to keep as many exhaust pipes at bay as humanly possible."	['a report']
It can be inferred from the The Cat in the Hat that _ .	"Children's Storybooks and Tales: This site is dedicated to Children's Story Books and how to tell Children's Stories. If you enjoy a child's story or have kids of your own then please browse this site to find some great stories and how to read them. The Cat in the Hat---Dr. Seuss In the first book featuring the character (The Cat in the Hat, 1957), the Cat brings chaos to a household of two young children on one rainy day while their mother is out. Bringing with him two creatures appropriately named Thing One and Thing Two, the Cat performs all sorts of tricks to amuse the children, with mixed results. The Cat's tricks are vainly opposed by the family pet, who is a conscious goldfish. The children (Sally and her older brother) finally prove good ones, capturing the Things and bringing the Cat under control. He cleans up the house on his way out, disappearing seconds before the mother comes back. The Famous Fire---Enid Blyton The Famous Fire is Enid Blyton's most popular and celebrated series of children's books. The sequence began life in 1942, when the first book, Fire on a Treasure Island was published and it has won great praise from both fans and critics. The series has gone on to become amongst the best-loved stories ever to have been written for children. Tom and Pippo in the Garden---Helen Oxenbury In 1988 Helen Oxenbury created a series of books featuring Tom, a naughty young boy, and his beloved stuffed monkey, Pippo. Ms. Oxenbury remarked that Tom was very much like her son ""when he was a little boy"". Like Tom, her son would often blame his misdeeds on his trusted buddy, the friendly family dog. The BFG---Roald Dahl The story is about an orphan girl named Sophie. One night when Sophie cannot sleep during the ""witching hour"" and sees a giant blowing something into bedroom windows down the street. The giant sees her, and although she tries to hide in the bed, he reaches through the window and carries her away to his home."	['all tricks performed by the cat are not amusing']
According to the passage,people use euphemisms in order to _ .	"A euphemism (from the Greek words eu--well and pheme--speak) is a word or expression that is used when people want to find a polite or less direct way of talking about difficult or embarrassing topics like death or the bodily functions.Most people,for example,would find it very difficult to say in plain language that they have arranged for their sick old dog to be killed.They would soften the pain by saying:We had Ruby put down or We had Ruby put to sleep.Many people prefer to call someone plain than ugly,or cuddly rather than fat. Euphemisms are an important part of every language,but it seems that English has an evergrowing number of them.The nonnative speaker not only has to make sense of the euphemisms he hears,he also has to learn which euphemisms are appropriate in any particular situation.He might be aware that his American friend needs to use the toilet when she asks where the bathroom (or restroom,or comfort station) is,but he is less likely to guess that his English friend has the same need when he says he has to see a man about a dog.He might have learned,for example,that in the family way is a euphemism for pregnant.If,however,he says to his boss,""Congratulations!I hear your wife is in the family way,"" he would be using an expression that is too familiar for the circumstances. Schools are full of euphemisms.At Frankfurt International School,for example,the special lessons given to students who are having difficulties in their school subjects are called Study Center (in the middle school) and Academic Workshop (in the high school).Teachers rightly do not want to upset students or parents by being too frank or straightforward,and usually choose a softer word or expression to convey the same message."

From what Placida said, we know that she thinks _ .	"Parents are a child's first teachers. But some parents never learned from good examples. In New York City, Covenant House tries to help homeless young mothers become good parents. The twelve or so teenagers who live at the shelter attend parenting classes four days a week. The class is called Mommy and Me. Teacher Delores Clemens is a mother of five and a grandmother. She teaches basic skills, like how to give a baby a bath and how to dress a baby in different seasons. She remembers one student who learned from her mother not to pick up a crying baby. The mother said that would only make the child needy. ""I said 'That's not true. You have to hold your baby! He is crying for a reason. If you never pick him up, he's going to keep crying. Pick your baby up. Hug him! And she started to do that. They just want a little hugging and a little love. And it works!"" Delores Clemens said. Delores Clemens says her students also learn how to be good mothers by letting themselves be mothered. ""I'm doing something for them that never has been done for them before."" In class, with her baby son, is Natasha. She lived on the streets. She is glad not only for the warmth and shelter of Covenant House. As she told reporter Adam Phillips, she is also glad for the help they offer in looking for a safer life. ""Did you go to high school?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you graduate?"" ""No, I didn't. I was in my last year and then, I got pregnant and I got lazy."" ""You look like you are willing to accept responsibility for that."" ""Yes, I am, and I would like to finish."" Some teenage mothers wish they themselves could be children again. 18-year-old Placida knows that feeling. ""Because you have to get up every two hours in the middle of the night, and you can't go out and say 'I am going to buy this for myself.' No. I have to buy pampers, clothes and food. So now it's two. So it's very hard."" Placida said."	['being a mom is hard']
What do the young people think of the Internet according to the text?	As for older people, some of the applications are hard to use because they didn't grow up with them. They don't have simple models of how it should work. They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls. And they think of e-mail as old-fashioned and slow. The reason why teens don't make phone calls seems to be that they don't know what to say. When they call they often pause for a while. On the other hand, texting is considered proper, and it's OK if you don't answer.

The problem is that Jean's family are so busy that they can hardly find time to be with her. Jean is quite lonely . So she spends a lot of time on her QQ. She likes being anonymous , talking to people who do not know about her famous family and her rich life. She uses the name Linda on QQ and has made a lot of friends. Last year Jean made a very special friend on QQ. His name was David and he lived in San Francisco. David was full of stories and jokes. He and Jean had the same interest in rock music and modern dance. So it always took them hours to talk happily on QQ and sometimes they even forgot their time. Of course, they wanted to know more about each other. David sent a picture of himself. He was a tall, good-looking young man with big, happy smile. As time went by, they became good friends and often sent cards and small things to each other. When Jean's father told her that he was going on a business trip to San Francisco, she asked him to let her go with him. She wanted to give David a surprise for his birthday. She would take him the latest DVD of a rock singer. But when she knocked on David's door in San Francisco, she found that her special friend was a 70-year-old man named Jim! How disappointed Jean was!	"[""Don't believe those you get to know on QQ easily.""]"
This passage is most probably written by _ .	"After a while, Tommy's parents, who had recently separated, would arrive for a meeting on his failing schoolwork and bad behavior. Neither parent knew that I had called the other. Tommy, an only child, had always been a happy, cooperative and top student. How could I make his father and mother believe that his recent failing grades meant a broken-hearted child's reaction to his parents' separation and divorce ? Tommy's mother entered and took one of the chairs. Soon the father arrived. Good! At least they were enough to be here in time. They ignored each other. As I gave a detailed introduction of Tommy's behavior and schoolwork, I waited for the right words to bring these two together to help them see what they were doing to their son. But somehow the words wouldn't come. Perhaps if they saw one of his dirty, carelessly done papers? I found a sheet in the back of his desk. Writing covered both sides: not the exercises, but a single sentence scribbled over and over. Silently I gave it to Tommy's mother. She read it and then handed it to her husband. Then his face softened. At last he folded the paper carefully, placed it in his pocket, and reached for his wife's hand. She wiped the tears from her eyes and smiled up at him. He helped with her coat and they left together. In his own way God had given me the words to reunite that family. He had guided me to the sheet of yellow copy paper covered with the pain outpouring of a small boy's troubled heart. The words are ""Dear Mom... Dear Daddy... I love..."""	['a teacher']
James Flynn holds the belief that _ .	"Next time you raise an eyebrow at the views of your partner, friend, sibling or colleague, remember they could be helping to make you smarter. New research shows that intelligence is not fixed but can be boosted throughout adulthood by family members, bright mates and intellectually stretching careers. The study challenges the commonly held belief that intelligence is static by the age of about 18. Current scientific consensus suggests that intelligence is controlled by genes, with environmental factors such as schooling and nutrition playing a partial role up to this age. After this point, IQ scores stabilize . But James Flynn, professor of political studies and psychology at the University of Otago in New Zealand, argues that people can ""upgrade"" their own intelligence throughout their lives. He believes intellectual stimulation from others is crucial as the ""brain seems to be rather like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets"". However, the opposite is also true - so people sharing a home or workplace with those who are intellectually challenged risk seeing their IQ levels fall as a result. He found the ""understanding quality"" of a family changes the IQs of all members, especially children. It can ""lift"" or hold back, depending on the ""gap between their brightness and that of their siblings and parents"". A bright ten-year-old with brothers and sisters of average intelligence will suffer a five to ten point IQ disadvantage, compared to a similar child with equally bright siblings. However, children with a low IQ could gain six to eight points by having brighter siblings and special educational treatment to help pull them up. Professor Flynn also concluded that although genetics and early life experiences determine about 80 percent of intelligence, the remaining 20 percent is linked to lifestyle. This means that people can raise their IQ, or allow it to fall, by ten points or more. Therefore, the best way to boost IQ level is to mix with bright friends, find an intellectually challenging job and marry someone cleverer."

What's the best title for the passage?	"Mother Hen's family is very poor. They don't have lots of money to buy food. Mother Hen often takes her children out to look for food. On a sunny day, Mother Hen plays with her children on the grass. She finds a grain of wheat . So she asks her children to plant it in the garden. But her children don't do it. Mother Hen has to do it herself. A few months later, they get a lot of wheat. She asks her children, ""Who would like to take the wheat to the store and get some _ ?"" But her children don't want to do it. So she takes the wheat to the store and brings the flour home. After getting home, she asks, ""Who will make some bread with the flour?"" They all say, ""I'm not free."" When she makes the bread, she says to her children, ""Who wants to eat the bread?"" ""I do,"" they all say. ""No, you can't. You don't do anything before I make the bread. You must know 'No pains, no gains .' She doesn't give any bread to her children and she eats the bread herself."	['No pains, no gains']
"According to the passage, ""it is nice to watch an underdog"" probably means _ ."	"While watching the Olympics the other night, I came across an unbelievable sight. It was not a gold medal, or a world record broken, but a show of courage. The event was swimming and started with only three men on the blocks. For one reason or another, two of them false started, so they were disqualified. That left only one to compete. It would have been difficult enough, not having anyone to race against, even though the time on the clock is important. I watched the man dive off the block and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold - his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle. The crowd started to laugh. Clearly this man was not a medal competitor. I listened to the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes and you could tell he was worn out. But in those few awful strokes, the crowd had changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and shout ""Come on, you can do it!"" and he did. A clear minute past the average swimmer, this young man finally finished his race. The crowd went wild. You would have thought that he had won the gold, and he should have. Even though he recorded one of the slowest times in Olympic history, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors. Just a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to Sydney. In a competition where athletes remove their silver medals feeling they have somehow been cheated out of gold, or when they act so proudly in front of their competitirs, _ ."

How much time does a British student usually spend at school in a week?	In Britain, children go to school from Monday to Friday. School usually starts nine o'clock in the morning and finishes at about three o'clock in the afternoon. Most schools ask their students to wear a school uniform. School always starts with registration. What is registration? Every child going to school each morning and afternoon is recorded in a special book. The teacher reads out each child's name in turn. On hearing his/her name, the child makes a reply and the teacher writes in the book. From the book, you can see whether the child is in school or not. At 9:10, children go to the meeting place. There they sing songs, listen to a story and pray . The first lesson begins at 9:20. They have break time from 10:20 to 10:35. During break time, the children have a snack and play games outdoors. After that, they go back in for another lesson until lunch at 12:00. Afternoon lessons begin at 1:10 and end at 3:15, and children go home. They don't have a break in the afternoon.

The woman was feeling nervous because_.	"As the sound of footsteps behind her grew louder, she quickened her pace. She didn't want to turn around as the memory of that morning's newspaper headline made her afraid of what she would see: ""City Killer Claims Fourth Victim."" ""Why did I stop for a few drinks in the bar after work?"" she thought to herself. Now it was dark and the streets deserted. She was alone and _ She felt as if she was walking in the rain. Her clothes were damp from nervous sweat and as each short hot breath hit the night air, it turned to steam, coating her glasses in a thin film so all she saw seemed covered in fog. The footsteps were closer now. She needed to get off this street. Her eyes began a useless search for an open store or lighted window. Passing a small lane she looked through,for a possible escape route. But the lane was a dead - end and she laughed to herself at the irony. The sound of a car behind her turning onto the street interrupted her self - pity. Escape was at hand. But as she was about to throw herself onto the road and shout for the car to stop, the car's headlights cast a shadow that paralyzed her with terror. It was the footsteps' owner. The figure was huge and in its raised arm it held what looked like a lead-pipe, no doubt the one that was about to claim victim number five. The shadow dissolved as the car passed by and disappeared into the distance. She felt a hand on her shoulder. It was all happening as if in slow - motion. She was waiting for her life to flash before her eyes like all those novels said it would - but it didn't. The only thing she thought of was her dear husband. She recalled phoning him from work that very afternoon and joking about, of all things, the city killer. It was a night full of ironies. There was a voice talking to her now but she was lost in thoughts of her fate and didn't respond. The hand then began turning her around. It was surprisingly gentle given what was about to come. She allowed it to guide her without resistance. (;) She looked up. She recognized the face, but she didn't know from where. Its mouth was still talking to her but she couldn't understand. Then she remembered. The face belonged to the foreign looking man who had served her at the bar. She looked down to his hand and saw in it not a lead - pipe but a rolled up copy of a work report she had been correcting in the bar as she drank. His words suddenly started to register in her brain and she could hear him. ""Miss, Miss. Are you OK? You left this in the bar and it looked important so I thought I'd better give it to you."""

The passage mainly gives us advice on _ .	"On Web sites across the Internet, people can access a variety of information about you. It's in your interest to be aware of your online reputation and to take the necessary actions to make it what you want it to be. The first step in protecting or improving your online reputation is to find out what information is already posted on the Internet and to assess the impression it leaves on people. Follow these tips to monitor and evaluate your online reputation: Play the name game. Begin by typing your first and last name into several popular search engines to see where you are mentioned and in what context. Example: Robin Counts Focus your search. To get moreprecise results, put quotation marks around your name, so that the search engine reads your name as a phrase and not as two or more unrelated words that just happen to appear in the text. Example: ""Robin Counts"" Search all of your names. If you have ever used a different name, if you use your middle name or initial, if you use a nickname, or if your name is frequently misspelled, search all variations to make sure you don't miss anything important. Example: ""Robin Counts"" ""Robin J. Counts"" ""Robin Counts Jensen"" Be strategic. If your search turns up information about other people who share your name, you caneliminate many false hits by using keywords. You can add keywords that apply only to you; for example your city, your employer, or a hobby. Example: ""Robin Counts"" ""Woodgrove Bank"" ""Robin counts""----skydiving Go blogging. If any of your friends, family members or coworkers have blogs or personal Web pages on social networking sites, check them out from time to time to see if they are writing about you or posting pictures of you. Be alert. Use the feature provided by some search engines that enables you to receive automatic notification of any new mention of your name or other personal information."

What conclusion can be drawn from the passage?	I usually doubt about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago.While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, 1 was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children between 9 and 17 have a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago. Why are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place. Given that _ , adults can still do plenty to help the next generation to cope. At the top of the list,nurturing is a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress. To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later.They will then have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep. Limit the amount of virtual violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news. Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale. Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you deal with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable,but it doesn't have to ruin your life.	"[""Children's anxiety can be removed with more parental care.""]"
When you chat online, you should chat with the people who _ .	"While there are some unpleasant people in the world, let's not forget that most people are friendly! If you find someone who likes the same restaurants as you or who is also crazy about ""Harry Potter"", then feel free to talk the night away! Just keep the conversation light and about your common interests. If a topic is brought up that doesn't sit well with you, keep in mind that you are always in control. Ignore your manners at this time! Do stay open-minded. Sometimes chatting with strangers can turn into a close bond--or just another person you can turn to for a laugh. But when typing away in your computer, it's easy to get carried away and to want to tell your new friend all about yourself. Keep the personal details as secret, and instead talk about fun hobbies or the latest episode of ""The Good Wife"". If Stranger Sally is asking what you look like, time to put up the red flag. It is never necessary for someone to know what you look like. Always listen to your gut .If something inside you is telling you something isn't right, it probably isn't. Pay attention to how your body responds to certain people online. Remember, you never really know who you are talking to just by looking at a computer screen name, so downloading anything is an no. See? Talking to strangers online doesn't always have to be a nightmare .By following these do's and don'ts, chatting with someone you don't know can be a cool experience,and can make sure that you stay safe in the world of the Internet."

Which statement is true according to the writer's attitude ?	"Although women lead healthier, longer lives, the cruel opinion that they become ""old"" sooner than men is widespread in the workplace , research shows . A survey of more than 2,600 managers and personnel professionals showed that age discrimination is not only common in the workplace , but is shot through with inconsistencies . Six in ten managers reported being a victim of age discrimination--usually because they were turned down for a job for being too old or too young . Yet more than a fifth admitted that they used ages as an important standard . Although the survey found widespread agreement that older workers were better than younger colleagues when it came to reliability , commitment , loyalty and customer service , these qualities were not necessarily considered to be worthy of advancement . A large number of persons believed that workers between 30 and 39 had the best promotion chances , with only 2 percent giving example of 50 year-olds or above. There was evidence that people were considered old at different ages in different jobs . A young man working in IT said he was considered too old by the age of 28. In fact there was no evidence to suggest that older workers were less valuable to companies than younger workers , in fact the opposite was often true because older workers often brought experience . The findings also suggested that the Government's ideas on age in the workforce may also be out of step with reality."	"[""The present age standard doesn't go with reality .""]"
My parents live _ .	"I lived in a big city. It's noisy and dirty and I got very tried. At the weekends I like to leave the city and get some fresh air and a good rest. A few weekends ago I decided to see my parents. I was really looking forward to it. My parents live a long way away. I went to see them with James, a friend, and we drove down on Friday night. In the middle of the trip it began to rain. The roads became very wet and it was difficult to drive. We arrived home just after midnight, feeling tired. The next morning it was still raining. James took his car to the local garage which was very good. In the afternoon the weather became better. We wanted to go for a drive. My parents lent us their car. That was no good. Their car didn't work! We rang the garage. ""Oh, no."" they said, ""your car won't be ready until tomorrow."" So it wasn't possible to go for a drive. We decided to play a word game. When we didn't agree about a word we looked for a dictionary. It wasn't there. Suddenly my mother remembered. ""I lent it to your sister. She took it with her when she left."" The word game wasn't any good without a dictionary. On Sunday my mother dropped a suitcase on her foot and we had to hire a taxi to take her to hospital.

According to the passage, which of the following happens that you may not turn to the counsellors?	Students often meet with questions as follows: bullied by someone, worried about a weak subject, puzzled by family problems or concerned about pets at home. All the questions above may make you not concentrated on your study. Who can you turn to if you are such an unlucky student?

That doesn't mean your counsellor will wave a magic wand and the problem will go away. But it does mean he or she will help you cope with it. Coping is an important word to know. Sometimes, kids and grown-ups have difficult problems. Coping means that someone is trying to handle these problems and make things better. Your school counsellor is available for you and wants to make your school experience the best it can be. The counsellor's job is to take your problem seriously and help you find a solution. The counsellor also wants to help you learn as much as you can in class, be a contributing member of the school community, and be a positive influence on your environment.

In the writer's opinion, the little girl _ .	I was working as an intern at my University's Museum of Natural history when I was an undergraduate in college. One day while working at the cash register in the gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a little girl in a wheelchair. As I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she was kind of perched on her chair. I then realized that she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and upper body. She was wearing a little white dress with red dots. As the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink , As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me a nicest, largest smile I had ever seen. All of a sudden her handicap was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and almost instantly gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. She took me away from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world; a world of smiles, love and warmth. That was 10 years ago. I'm a successful business person now and whenever I get down and think about the troubles of the world, I think about that little girl and the unforgettable lesson about life that she taught me.

The passage tells us about _ of the education.	"Education is not an end, but a means to an end. In other words, we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them. Our purpose is to fit them for life. In some modern countries it has for some time been fashionable to think that by free education for all -- one can solve all the problems of society and build a perfect nation. But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with university degree; they refuse to do what they think ""low"" work; and, in fact, work with hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries. But we have only to think a moment to understand that the work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor; we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns... In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever work suited to his brains and ability and, secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society, and that is very bad to be ashamed of one's work. Only such a type of education can be considered valuable to society."	['the value']
The writer uses the example of rat as food to show that _ .	We all have ideas about what kinds of foods are good or bad to eat. As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are unacceptable. Many people would find it terrible to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as proper food. Food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition. For example, broccoli is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. But dislikes is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food. In some cultures, certain foods are taboo. Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden. We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture. One example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food. In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets. They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases. In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals . Actually, the dog's place in society as a companion makes the dog taboo as food. Scientists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people. People will not eat pets such as dogs. Americans eat a lot of beef because there is plenty of land for raising cattle and their meat can be shipped cheaply for long distances by railroads.

What is the purpose of the passage?	There have always been a lot of commonly believed but exercise. Some people believe that they can't help putting on hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles will turn into fat. Here are some more myths: false ideas about being fat and doing weight as they get older, while others I'll never lose weightI come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are bom with, we can't blame our genes for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habits of eating too much and exercising too little. I am fat because I burn calories slowly Wrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume more energy than slim people,they also fail to realize how much they eat! Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately. Exercise is boring Wrong! Anything will become boring if you do it repetitively. The key is to develop a balanced and varied program thafs fun as well as progressive. If you enjoy a Sunday walk,take a different route. If you do yoga,try a tai chi class. If you like swimming, set yourself a distance or time challenge. No pain, no gain Wrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury. You may experience mild discomfort as you begin to exercise regularly, but this is your body adapting to the positive changes in your lifestyle and the aches should disappear relatively quickly. If they don't, rest and seek medical advice.	['To clarify some misconceptions about fatness and exercise.']
What was the boy doing on the street?	"A small boy sat on the street with a hat by his feet. He held up a sign which said: "" I am blind, please help"". There were only a few coins in the hat. A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked :""Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?"" The man said: ""I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way."" What he had written was: ""Today is a beautiful day but I cannot see it."" Do you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing? Of course both signs told people the boy was blind. But the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat. The second sign told people that they were able to enjoy the day, but the boy could not enjoy it because he was blind. The first sign simply said the boy was blind. The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. There are at least two lessons we can learn from this simple story. The first is: Be thankful for what you have. Someone else has less. Help where you can. The second is:Be creative. Think differently. There is always a better way!"	['He was begging for money.']
According to Annette Simms, _ .	"What's your earliest childhood memory? Can you remember the first time you heard thunder or watched a television program? Adults seldom recall events much earlier than the year or so before entering school, just as children younger than three or four rarely keep any memory of specific, personal experiences. A variety of explanations have been put forward by psychologists for this ""childhood amnesia"" . One argues that the _ , the region of the brain which is responsible for forming memories, does not mature until about the age of two. But the most popular theory thinks that, since adults do not think like children, they cannot access childhood memories. Adults think in words, and their life memories are like stories. But when they search through their mental files for early childhood memories to add to this verbal life story, they don't find any that fit the pattern. It's like _ . Now psychologist Annette Simms offers a new explanation for ""childhood amnesia"". She argues that there simply aren't any early childhood memories to recall. According to Dr. Simms , children need to learn to use someone else's spoken description of their personal experiences in order to turn their own short-term, quickly forgotten impressions of these experiences into long-term memories. In other words, children hear others talk about their experiences--Mother talking about the afternoon spent looking for crabs at the beach or Dad asking them about their day at Ocean Park. Without the help of this kind of verbal description, says Dr. Simms, children cannot form long-term memories of their personal experiences."

How did those who took part in the study perform when asked to recall small details?	"People who smoke could lose around one third of their daily memory, researchers say. A study by a team at Northumbria University showed that smokers lost more of their memory when compared to non-smokers. And the research also found that those who kicked the habit saw their ability to recollect information restored to almost the same level as non-smokers. The study involved more than seventy 18-to-25-year-olds and included a tour of the university's campus. Those who took part were asked to recall small details, such as a list of songs played at a campus concert and tasks completed at various points-known as real world memory test. Smokers performed badly, remembering just 59 percent of tasks. But those who had given up smoking remembered 74 percent and those who had never smoked recalled 81 percent of tasks. Dr. Tom Heffernan, who leads Northumbria University's Collaboration for Drug and Alcohol Research Group, said the findings would be useful in anti-smoking campaigns. He said, ""Given that there are up to 10 million smokers in the UK and as many as 45 million in the United States, it's important to understand the effects smoking has on everyday cognitive function-of which prospective memory is an excellent example. "" ""This is the first time that a study has set out to examine whether giving up smoking has an _ on memory. We already know that giving up smoking has huge health benefits for the body, but this study also shows how stopping smoking can have knock-on benefits for cognitive functions too. '' The research will now investigate the effects of passive smoking on memory, while Dr. Heffernan and Dr. Terence O'Neil will look into the effects of third-hand smoking-toxins left on curtains and furniture."

The tigherfish _ .	"January 16, 2014 - We know the saying ""The early bird gets the worm"", but today you're going to learn about the interesting saying ""The early fish gets the bird.""

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Britain is a popular tourist place. But tours of the country have pros and cons. Good news Free museums. No charge for outstanding collections of art and antiquities. Pop music. Britain is the only country to match the US on this score. Black cabs.

What is the author's attitude towards protecting intellectual property rights7	You wouldn't steal a car. You would never rob a bank or pick someone's pocket. But you may be another kind of thief. If you have ever bought a disc for 15 yuan or less, then you have helped to rob artists or musicians of their intellectual properly rights . Last Thursday was World Intellectual Property Day. Activities to tell people about intellectual property rights were held around the country. Intellectual property includes inventions, literary and artistic works, names, and pictures. They are of little value if they are not read, seen and used. While the cost of copying discs is very small, authors, singers and actors have to spend a lot of money and time making a new product. That's why they have the right to make money from their work. So buying pirated music of Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai is like stealing from them, paying them no respect for their hard work. If Jay Chou cannot make money from his work, he may not make anything else. But those who make pirated goods are becoming rich without doing any hard work. The authors should ask for a fair price for their work. Earlier this year there was much talk about how much KTV clubs should pay the music companies for using their songs. The copyright fee also should be fair to the users. That's good for the music's popularity and society as well.	['He is for it.']
What's the best title for the passage?	"It was a beautiful summer afternoon. I happened to be at a local Walmart picking up some stuff for my wife when I laid my eyes on two young ladies. They were walking confidently, with their heads held high, which made me believe that they were involved in some kind of competitive sport. They were wearingT-shirts, at the back of which printed, ""Pain is temporary, but pride is forever."" Thinking of these words, I automatically said to myself, ""That's right! No pain, no gain."" Whatever is worth having is worth fighting for, and with fight, there comes pain! Fortunately, pain is just temporary. However, it is a necessary step you need to take to get your gain. Athletes and their coaches understand this so well. They spend so many hours and so much effort preparing for a competition. Some will think about giving up when the training is so painful, but coaches are there to remind them that ""quitters never win and winners never quit"".. So they know that when victory comes, they will be proud of themselves and that pride can last a lifetime. You've probably heard the saying, ""There's no such thing as a free lunch."" Well, it is true. Everything in life has a price, whether you agree or not. To want something for free will always lead to deception. Even if you get it, you will not value it or enjoy it, because it is free. No one has told you that life is easy! In fact it is a series of struggles and fights. You will achieve what other people call ""impossible"" only when you are willing to endure pain and overcome fear and doubt. Your achievement in life is in direct proportion to how much sacrifice you are willing to make. Successful people are usually and wrongly labeled as lucky or highly favored by circumstances. However, if you hear their personal stories, you will realize that they went through a lot of trials, but still kept on going, enduring the pain to make where they are today. If we understand that every effect has its cause, then we will grasp the fact that we do have a chance to influence the outcome we get in life."	['No pain, no gain.']
It would be difficult for British people to look for a cigarette in America because _ .	"Recently,I came across an interesting article on the differences between British English and American English.

How did people cross the Golden Gate Strait before the bridge was built?	"The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California is one of the world's most beautiful bridges. It is also one of the most visited places in the world. Vehicles cross the bridge an average of 41 million times each year. More than 1,800 hundred million vehicles have used the bridge since it opened more than 70 years ago. The bridge was painted ""International Orange"" because that color went well with the natural surroundings. The color also is easier to see in the heavy fog that often covers the area. But the Golden Gate Bridge was not named for its orange color. It was named for the body of water that it crosses, the Golden Gate Strait. The Golden Gate Strait is the entrance to the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. The Golden Gate Bridge links the city of San Francisco with Marin County,California. Planning for the bridge began in the 1920s when the area around San Francisco was growing. People living in the area needed another way to get to the city besides small ferries . Joseph Strauss was the chief engineer for the project. Work began in 1934. Mr.Strauss demanded the strongest safety protections in the history of bridge building. These included the first use of ""hard hats"" to protect the workers' heads and special glasses to protect their eyes. A special safety net was suspended under the bridge. This net saved the lives of 19 men during the construction. However, 11 other workers were killed when they fell from the bridge through the net. Still, this was a new safety record for the time. The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937. It extends 1,280 meters across the water. The total length is 2,737 meters. It was the largest suspension bridge in the world until 1964. That is when the Verrazano Narrows Bridge opened in New York City. Today, the Golden Gate Bridge is the ninth longest suspension bridge in the world."	['By boat.']
According to the new study, musical training _ .	"Many people believe that teaching children music makes them smarter, better able to learn new things. But the organizers of a new study say there's no scientific evidence that early musical training affects the intelligence of young people. An estimated 80 percent of American adults think music lessons improve children's abilily to learn or their performance in school. They say that the satisfaction for learning to play a new song helps a child express creativity. Researchers at Harvard University, however, have found that there's one thing musical training does not do. They say it does not make children more intelligent. Samuel Mehr is a graduate student at Harvard's School of Education. He said it is wrong to think that learning to play a musical instrument improves a child's intellectual development. He says the evidence comes from studies that measured the mental ability of two groups of 4-year-olds and their parents. One group attended music class, the other went to a class that places importance on the visual arts--arts that can be seen. ""The evidence there is 'no'. We found no evidence for any advantage on any of these tests for the kids participating in these music clases,"" said Mehr.Samuel Mehr says researchers have carried out many studies in an effort to learn whether musical training can make children smarter. He says the results have been mixed. He says only one study seems to show a small percentage increase in IQ, intellectual scores among students after one year of music lessons. He does not believe that IQ is a good measure of child's intelligence. He says researchers in his study compared how well children in the musical training group did on mental processing tasks or projects, then the results were compared to those of children who did not take lessons. There was no evidence that the musical training group did much better on the mental tasks than the other group. The researchers comfirmed the results with a larger group of children and their parents.Mr Mehr says music lessons may not offer children a fast easy way to gain entry to the best schools later of their life. But he says the training is still important for cultural reasons. In his words, ""We teach music because music is important for us."""	['does not make children more intelligent']

"When the writer says that animals seem ""to be catching on"" , he means _ ."	"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side. Most people know this joke. But recently, some people have been much more worried about how the grizzly bear and mountain lion can cross the road. "" Millions of animals die each year on the U. S. roads, "" the Federal Highway Administration reports. In fact, only about 80 ocelots , an endangered wild cat, exist in the U. S. today. The main reason? Roadkill. ""Eco-passages"" may help animals cross the road without being hit by cars. They are paths both over and under roads. "" These ecopassages can be extremely useful,so that wildlife can avoid road accidents ,"" said Jodi Hilty of the Wildlife Protection Society. But do animals actually use the eco-passages? The answer is yes. Paul Beier of Northern Arizona University found foot marks left by mountain lions on an eco-passage that went under a highway. This showed that the lions used the passage. Builders of eco-passages try to make them look like a natural part of an area by planting trees on and around them. Animals seem to be catching on. Animals as different as salamanders and grizzly bears are using the bridges and underpasses. The next time you visit a park or drive through an area with a lot of wildlife, look around. You might see an animal over-pass !"	['animals begin to learn to use eco-passages']
Sam Boakye was determined to get good grades partly because _ .	"Fighting racial stereotypes on US campuses often begins by putting students of different ethnic backgrounds together -- under one dormitory roof. Sam Boakye was a freshman at Ohio State University and the only black student on his floor. He was determined to get good grades -- in part to make sure his white roommate had no basis for negative racial views. ""You're pushed to do better, to challenge the stereotype that black people are not that smart,"" he told theNew York Times. Several recent studies have found that having a roommate of a different race can reduce prejudice , diversify friendships and even promote students' academic performance. In a study by Ohio State psychology professor Russell Fazio, black freshmen who came to college with high test scores earned better grades if they had a white roommate--even if the roommate's test scores were low. Another study on student interaction by Duke University suggests that freshmen with roommates of a different race were the most likely to diversify their friendships. ""Just having diversity in classrooms doesn't do anything to increase interracial friendships,"" said Claudia Buchman, an author of the Duke study. ""But living together with a different-race roommate does lead to more interracial friendships."" There are, however, some problems with such room assignments. Fazio's study found that three times as many randomly assigned interracial roommates weren't living together at the end of the semester, compared with white roommates. Interracial roommates also spent less time together, had fewer joint activities and were less involved with each other's friends than white pairs. As for Boakye, this is not the case. ""A lot of white students come without much exposure to diversity, so when their first interaction with a black guy isn't bad, they will make more black friends. I think I made a good impression on my freshman roommate. I saw him this year, and he said, 'Hey dude, you're not the only black friend I have.' That felt good."""

It wasn't until he became seriously ill that we really got to know each other and had a place in each other's lives. After his near death and many operations, I was trained as his nurse to take care of him. Although the job seemed boring and tiring in certain people's eyes, I liked it.

Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	"It all began with a stop at a red light. Kevin Salwen was driving his 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, back from a sleepover in 2006 . While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other. ""Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.""Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered her parents about _ insisting that she wanted to do something. ""What do you want to do?"" her mom responded. ""Sell our house?"" Warning! _ . Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home. Eventually, that's what the family did. The project --crazy, impetuous and utterly inspiring -- is written down in detail in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: ""The Power of Half."" It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street. At a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness. Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house."	['Hannah asked her parents to do something charitable and they sold their house.']
More and more students tend to choose International internships because _	"Connecticut College senior Paul Dryden has known for years that he'd have lots of competition for an entry--level promotions job inprefix = st1 /New York's music industry. So in a bid to get an advantage last summer, he invented a job for himself. The job, as an intern in Universal MusiCs Buenos Aires office, had never existed before Dryden proposed it. Yet because he was willing to work without pay, he got his foot in the door and was soon translating interviews with American rock stars for his boss, who didn't speak English. ""In theU.S., lye done a lot of internships where interns do all the busywork -- copying, stapling, the boring stuff,"" Dryden says. ""But in this position (inArgentina), I felt very valuable to the company."" International internships have been around since the 1950s, but they've become much more popular lately.

The author believes that a vicious circle can turn into a good one when _ .	Educating girls quite possibly outputs a higher rate of return than any other investment available in the developing world. Women's education may be an unusual field for economists, but raising women's contribution to development is actually as much an economic as a social problem. And economics, with its emphasis on motivation, provides an explanation for why so many girls can't receive education. Parents in low-income countries fail to invest in their daughters because they do not expect them to make an economic contribution to the family: girls grow up only to marry into somebody else's family and bear children. Girls are thus seen as less valuable than boys and are kept at home to do housework while their brothers are sent to school-- _ , trapping women in a vicious circle of neglect. An educated mother, on the other hand, has greater earning abilities outside the home and faces an entirely different set of choices. She is likely to have fewer but healthier children and can insist on the development of all her children, ensuring that her daughters are given a fair chance. The education of her daughters then makes it much more likely that the next generation of girls, as well as of boys, will be educated and healthy. The vicious circle is thus transformed into a good circle. Few will disagree with it that educating women has great social benefits. But it has enormous economic advantages as well. Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers. Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling. Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available investments, but they are just the beginning. Educating women also has a significant influence on health practices, including family planning.	['girls can gain equal access to education']

Mr Shum:Well,in fact I think of myself firstly as a person, secondly as a painter and thirdly as someone with a physical handicap. Can I say that I am not happy with the word ""handicapped""? I am a popular painter because my paintings are good, not because they were painted by a handicapped person. ""handicapped""means you can't do anything. It is difficult for me to do some things like getting dressed. Reporter: Were you born with your handicap? Mr Shum:No. An accident happened to me when I was 15 years old.After that I became depressed and even tried to end my life, but my mother was always there for me."	['a person']
The biggest advantage of this new system is that _	Excused from recycling because you live in a high rise with a rubbish chute ? You won't be for long. Miami's Mark Shantzis has made it simple for those living in tall buildings to use the chute and recycle too . In Shantzis' Hi-Rise Recycling System, a chute leads to a pie-shaped container with six boxes that can turn around when operated. The system , which fits in the same space as the chute and container now in use, enables glass , plastic , paper , metal , and other rubbish to go into separate boxes . The system is controlled from a board next to the chute door. The board has a button for each class of recycling materials (as well as for unrecyclables). At the press of a button, a microcomputer locks all other floors' chute door and sets the recycling container turning until the right box comes under the chute. The computer also counts the loads and gives a signal by phone when the box is full. And a particular piece of equipment breaks up the nonrecyclables Sorting recyclables before they are collected saves the use of expensive materials recovery equipment which otherwise has to do the sorting . Such equipment often makes recycled materials very expensive, so expensive that tons of recyclables remain wasted . Shantzis believes his system could help recycled materials become more cost-effective.	['it reduces the cost of recycling']
The purpose of Rothchild's study is to see _ .	If a diver surfaces too quickly, he may suffer the bends. Nitrogen dissolved in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure. The consequence, if the bubbles accumulate in a joint, is sharp pain and a bent body -- thus the name. If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain, the consequence can be death. Other air-breathing animals also suffer this decompression sickness if they surface too fast: whales, for example. And so, long ago, did ichthyosaurs . That these ancient sea-animals got the bends can be seen from their bones. If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply. This kills the cells in the bone, and consequently weakens it, sometimes to the point of collapse. Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends. Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past. What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years. To this end, he and his colleagues traveled the world's natural-history museums, looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. When he started, he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils, reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression. Instead, he was astonished to discover the opposite. More than 15% of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died, but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury. If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti-decompression means, they clearly did so quickly -- and, most strangly, they lost it afterwards. But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened. He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change. Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator such as a large shark. One of the features of the Jurassia oceans was an abundance of large sharks and crocodiles, both of which were fond of ichthyosaurs lunches. Trassic oceans, by contrast, were mercifully shark-and crocodile-free. In the Trassic, then, ichthyosaurs were top of the food chain. In the Jurrasic and Cretaceous, they were prey as well as predator --and often had to make a speedy exit as a result.	['how ichthyosaurs adapted to decompression']
Based on the text, we know that the study _ .	"Girls who play with Barbie dolls tend to see fewer career options available to them, compared with the options available to boys, according to a new study by researchers at Oregon State University and the University of California (UC), Santa Cruz. The study's authors, psychology professors, Aurora Sherman of Oregon State University and Eileen Zurbriggen at UC Santa Cruz, describe their findings as significant. ""This is one of the first studies to investigate how playing with sexualized dolls affects young girls, and also one of the first to look at the impact of such play on achievement or career aspirations , rather than body image,"" said Zurbriggen. Sherman suggests that Barbie and similar dolls are part of the burden of early and inappropriate sexuality placed on girls. Sherman and Zurbriggen used girls' doll play to study the impact of gender role socialization, a process through which children learn to follow cultural norms and which encourages gender stereotypical behavior. Thirty-seven girls from the age of four to seven from an Oregon college town were randomly arranged to play for five minutes with either a sexualized Doctor Barbie or Fashion Barbie doll, or with a more neutral Mrs. Potato Head doll. The girls were then shown photographs of ten occupations and asked how many they themselves or boys could do in the future. The girls who played with a Barbie doll saw themselves in fewer occupations, compared with boys. Those girls who played with Mrs. Potato Head reported nearly as many career options available for themselves as for boys. The two Barbie dolls were the same except for clothing, with unrealistic bodies, extremely youthful and attractive faces, and long full hair. The researchers believe that the doll itself has more of an effect on girls than the role or career aspirations suggested by its costume. ""It's significant that a few minutes of play with a Barbie doll had an immediate impact on the number of careers that girls saw as possible for themselves,"" Zurbriggen said."

The passage may be written by an experienced _ .	There comes a time in a person's life when they may realize that their laundry is just not coming out the way that they had hoped for. The whites may not be getting white enough or the color1s might be fading. This can cause you more money if you don't know how to properly do your laundry. These tips are lifesaving tips when it comes to washing your dirty clothes. If you have a habit of throwing all your clothes into the washing machine together, you need to stop now. Washing your clothes in the same load will only cause them to fade onto each other or not become as clean as they could. To save you lots of time, try buying a laundry sorter so that your clothes are already sorted and ready to be throne into the washing machine. Another great advice would be to read the labels on the back of the clothing. The labels are there for a reason and this could help to save you a lot of money in the long run. It makes sense not to wash something in warm water when it specifically says to wash in cold water, if you did you could end up with a shrunken sweater. There are basically five groups that your laundry should be sorted into; whites, lights, darks, bright color1ed clothes, and delicates. The whites are basically anything white like your undergarments and t-shirts. Try not to get the whites and the lights confused. The light color1ed clothes are those that can be white, striped, off-whites, pastels, cream color1ed, etc. Dark clothes are those including blacks, blues, and browns. The reason that this is important is because dark clothes tend to fade onto other clothes and there are also special products like Woolite Dark that you can buy to keep them from fading. It just makes sense to wash these separately. The bright clothes are those that are red, yellow, orange, green, florescent, etc. These clothes can make your other clothes turn color1s.	['life coach']

We can infer that the Indians may kill poison frogs in order to _ .	"You may have seen a lot of frogs, but if you haven't, you must have heard about frogs. However, have you heard about a frog that can kill a person? These small brightly colored amphibians live in the tropical rain forests of Central and South America. They are best known for their ability to kill persons even though they are no more than 2 inches long. If we touch their poisonous skin without proper protection (such as gloves), we may die! For animals of this size that can be so deadly, they are certainly one of the world's most poisonous animals! Who are they? They are poison arrow frogs or, simply, poison frogs. Poison frogs acquired their name from the Indians. The Indians catch and kill many of these frogs before hanging them upside down over a campfire. As the frogs get hot, the poison drips out of their skin. The Indians collect the poisonous liquid in a bottle and dip the tips of their arrows into the bottle. Once the tips are dried, they are ready to be used for their arrows for hunting. There are about 170 different types of poison arrow frogs in the world. Though most species have bright markings, either in stripes or patches, on their black bodies, some just wear noticeable single-colored coats. Their shocking skin colors-usually in yellow, red, green, blue or orange-serve as a warning sign to other animals. The sign simply says,"" Stay away or pay with your life!"" They certainly do not bluff."	['hunt animals']
Who are most likely to be affected by high blood pressure?	World Health Day is celebrated on 7 April to mark the anniversary of the founding of WHO in 1948. Each year a theme is selected for World Health Day that highlights a priority area of public health concern in the world. The theme for 2013 is high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes . If left uncontrolled, high blood pressure can also cause blindness, irregularities of the heartbeat and heart failure. The risk of developing these complications is higher in the presence of other risk factors such as diabetes . One in three adults worldwide has high blood pressure and this increases with age, from 1 in 10 people in their 20s and 30s to 5 in 10 people in their 50s. High blood pressure is most common in some low-income countries in Africa, with over 40% of adults in many African countries thought to be affected. However, high blood pressure is both preventable and treatable. In some developed countries, prevention and treatment of it has brought about a reduction in deaths from heart disease. The risk of developing high blood pressure can be reduced by: reducing salt intake; eating a balanced diet; avoiding harmful use of alcohol; taking regular physical activity; keeping a healthy body weight; and avoiding tobacco use. The final and most important goal of World Health Day 2013 is to reduce heart attacks and strokes, which includes as follows: 1.to raise awareness of the causes and consequences of high blood pressure; 2.to provide information on how to prevent high blood pressure 3.to encourage adults to check their blood pressure and to follow the advice of health-care professionals.

According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	If God could sing, his name must be Declan Galbraith. The boy was born on December 19, 1991 in the UK. He is an English singer of Scottish and Irish origin. His grandfather, who was in a band and played several instruments, often took Declan to concerts he was participating in. The mix of Scottish and Irish musical traditions inspired Declan and became his early musical influence. k%s5$u Declan's talent was publicly acknowledged for the first time when, at just 7 years old, he insisted on singing at the annual Rochester Dickens Festival, a two-day event where people were invited to dress up in Victorian costumes to celebrate the life and times of the famous novelist Charles Dickens and his links with town. Little Declan, dressed up as a chimney sweep, started singing. Soon after this, he started to enter local talent contests and within a year he had won 15 titles and more than PS1000. His first self-titled album, Declan, with Irish traditional songs and some specially written materials became a big success and charted in the UK and Ireland. Within the year of release , it had 200 000 copies in Germany. Although Declan is a British citizen and singer, Declan is better-known abroad, especially in China where his songs were chosen as part of the Chinese education curriculum for children learning English. In May 2008, Declan undertook a successful tour in China, and the cities included were Beijing and Shenzhen.	['Declan Galbraith began his success in singing at 7 years old. k%s5$u']
Why does the author say that Brownie was more than just a family pet?	"When I was six, dad brought home a dog one day, who was called ""Brownie"". My brothers and I all loved Brownie and did different things with her. One of us would walk her, another would feed her, then there were baths, playing catch and many other games. Brownie, in return, loved each other and every one of us. One thing that most touched my heart was that she would go to whoever was sick and just be with them. We always felt better when she was around. One day , as I was getting her food, she chewed up one of dad's shoes, which had to be thrown away in the end. I knew dad would be mad and I had to let her know what she did was wrong. When I looked at her and said, ""Bad girl,"" she looked down at the ground and then went and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes. Brownie turned out to be more than just our family pet. She went everywhere with us. People would stop and ask if they could pet her. Of course she'd let anyone pet her. She was just the most lovable dog. There were many times when we'd be out walking and a small child would come over and pull on her hair. She never barked or tried to get away. Funny thing is she would smile. This frightened people because they thought she was showing her teeth. Far from the truth, she loved everyone."	['She was loved by everybody she met.']

""She needed contact, but there is no reason that she should trust people after what she'd been through,""says Christ.""Humans had killed her family."" Although she became stronger a month after she was recued, her appearance revealed the psychological stress she carried inside--much of her hair had fallen out.That was a delayed reaction to the combined terrible experiences of losing her parents and being kept with a poor diet by the poachers.

Which of the following would be the best title for the text?	On February 3, a Laysan albatross , a large seabird, named Wisdom, which is 62 years old, hatched a healthy chick on a Pacific island near Hawaii,. It was the sixth year in a row this bird has hatched a chick. Wisdom's species normally lives only 12 to 40 years, while she is able to hatch healthy chicks into her 60s. At breeding time, the Laysan albatross will dig out a shallow nest in the ground. The female then lays a single egg. Both she and her mate will take turns incubating the egg until it hatches. More than seven out of every 10 Laysan albatrosses' nests are on just one island -Midway Atoll. That's Wisdom's home. But her species spends most of its time in the air. In fact, biologists observe that after learning to fly, these birds may not set foot on land for the next three to five years. Albatrosses are powerful gliders , With their six-foot, nearly two-meter, wingspan, Laysan albatrosses can ride wind currents for hundreds of miles or more. Biologists now estimate that Wisdom has flown for an unusually large number of miles-between two million and three million. That is equivalent to traveling from Earth to the moon and back-four to six times! And in the months when these birds are not breeding, they stay in the air, and even sleep there. Wild albatrosses often die long before they come close to Wisdom's age. Some are eaten. Others starve, get sick or suffer life-threatening injuries from people's fishing boats. Clearly, Wisdom is special. She may have raised as many as 35 chicks in her life.	['The Oldest Mother Bird-Wisdom.']

From the passage, we know that the heroes the American youth admire are those _ .	Every country has its heroes. The heroes are the people the nation and especially the young people admire. If you get a list of the heroes of a nation,it will tell you the potential of that nation. Today in prefix = st1 /America,if you ask the high school students to list their heroes,their choice would probably fall into three groups. The first group of heroes would be the rock stars--the people connected with rock music. There is no doubt that such people do have talent but one wonders if one should hold up rock stars as a model. The rock stars too often are mixed with drugs and their personal life is not all that good. The rock stars are rich and wear the latest fashion styles. However,one should seek more in a hero than such things as money and good clothes. A second type of hero for the American youth is the sports star. Again you have a person who has a great ability in one area-sports. However,too often the personal life of the sports star is a bit of a disorder. Too frequently drugs and drinking are a part of life of the sports star. A third type of hero is the TV or movie star. This person may have lots of acting talent and is quite handsome. However,the personal life of too many actors is quite sad and they should not be held up as a model of young people. Today,the rock star,the athlete,and the actor all have become the models of the youth in America. Really,do you hear a young person say that his hero is a doctor,a teacher,or a scientist?These people are not rich and do not wear fashionable clothes. However,they are talented people who work hard to make the world a better place for everyone. What is really sad is that the young try to imitate their heroes. They like to wear the same clothes and follow their styles. If the heroes of today for the American young people are limited only to rock stars,athletes and actors,the future does not look too bright.

Which of the following statements is WRONG according to the passage?	There was a huge battle between the warriors of Greece and the people of Troy. Prince Paris from Troy had stolen away the Greek queen; Helen. The Greek warriors set sail for Troy to fight for their queen. The battle outside Troy lasted for ten years. The men were fed up and wanted to return to their homes. Athene, goddess of war gave Ulysses the idea for a plan to end the war. They built a big wooden horse which they put in the middle of their encampment . Next they pretended to give up their camp. In reality many soldiers hid inside the wooden horse. Once they thought the camp had been abandoned the Trojans went out to check. They needed to know if the war was really over. They walked through the abandoned encampment and eventually found the wooden horse. They could not decide what it was. Some wanted to take it into the city, others thought that it was a gift to Zeus and feared touching or moving it in case they upset Zeus. Some Trojans decided to take it back into the city. They called a large group of troops, attached ropes and pulled it into the city. A huge celebration started. The city was free from war for the first time in nine years. Everybody feasted, drank and danced until eventually the merriment was over and they all went to sleep. This was the moment that the wooden horse opened a big flap hidden underneath. Out crept Ulysses and all of his men. They killed the sleeping troops, rescued Queen Helen, met up with the rest of their army and set sail for home. The story of the return journey is told in The Odyssey, a collection of poems piecing together the bits of the story from the many different places where the story took place.

What can we infer from the passage?	"Thick dust rose and a large building collapsed. This was the scene in Zhu Zhou,Hunan Province on May 17. Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from ""birth"" to ""death"".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the color--changing material is a type of molecule .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. Scientists have yet to do more research before the color--changing molecules can be used outside the lab."	"[""The bright light may make the material's warning system useless.""]"
The best title of this article is _ .	"The pomegranate is one of the oldest known fruits. Pomegranates are found in ancient writings and pictured in the ancient art of many cultures and religions. The pomegranate is also a symbol of health, fertility and long life. Experts think the pomegranate is native to northern India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Today it also grows in Southeast Asia, the western U.S., Armenia and parts of Africa, among other places. The skin of a pomegranate is strong. It can be red, purple or orange-yellow. The inside is filled with beautiful dark red seeds that shine like rubies. It is not easy to get them out. But the reward is great. Health benefits The pomegranate grows on trees. Parts of the pomegranate tree and fruit are used to make medicine. The pomegranate is used for many conditions. However, the U.S National Institutes of Health says there is not enough scientific evidence to rate pomegranates as effective for any of them. Still, in traditional medicine, the pomegranate is used for conditions of the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure and ""hardening of the arteries."" The jewel-like seeds of the pomegranate are loaded with many nutrients and chemicals called antioxidants . These antioxidants remove poisons from the body. The antioxidants found in pomegranates may help remove build-up of damage in blood vessels. So, it is a very heart-healthy fruit. Antioxidants slow the progression of age-related sickness and may slow the growth of cancer cells. Men who have prostate cancer may benefit from a daily serving of pomegranate juice. Pomegranates are used for weight loss and used as a treatment for sore throat. Pomegranates are also high in vitamin K, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron. Let's just say pomegranates are loaded with great things for the inside of your body. Beauty benefits But let's not forget the outside, too! Pomegranates are great for the skin. They protect the skin by encouraging new skin growth, healing wounds and repairing tissue. Pomegranates protect the skin against sun damage as well. They may help skin look younger by providing moisture and elasticity. Recipes for pomegranates But how does one eat a pomegranate? Pomegranates seeds are both sweet and tart. A thick liquid, or syrup, from the pomegranate tastes great with lamb, pork or chicken dishes. Pomegranate seeds provide extra flavor to salads and other vegetable dishes. The seeds are also delicious in rice and grain dishes. And, of course pomegranates make great desserts. In the U.S., pomegranate juice is often added to sparkling drinks, drinks called smoothies and alcoholic drinks. Fresh pomegranates are only available in the United States from September to January. They can keep, or remain good to eat, in the refrigerator for about two months if kept in a plastic bag."	['Pomegranate: Still Healthy at 5,000 Years Old']
What can we know about the airport at Honolulu?	Many people are upset when their flight is delayed. Not only do they have to change their schedule but, even worse, they have to wait in an airport!

What's the writer's attitude towards zoos?	"Zoos divide opinion : there are those who think it is cruel to keep animals locked up while others believe zoos are essential for the survival of endangered species. To argue that zoos imprison animals is to misunderstand what zoos are about. Without zoos many of the creatures we love and admire would no longer exist. Every single day,over one hundred animal species vanish. Scientists predict that as early as 2050 one quarter of the Earth's species will become extinct. Some animals are in danger because they are hunted. Alarmingly, the population of tigers has already fallen by ninety-five percent. Other species are in danger because of a lack of food. For example, there are fewer than 1300 giant pandas left in the wild. Zoos have special breeding programmes to help those animals at risk. These breeding programmes are proving extremely successful. As Irene Shapiro from Zoo and Wildlife Support says, ""the Puerto Rican Parrot has grown in numbers from just thirteen to about eighty-five and the Golden Lion Tamarin Monkey, which has almost ceased to exist twenty years ago, has been reintroduced back into the wild. "" Unfortunately, not everyone understands this important role zoos play. For example, Brian Featherstone from the Anti-Zoo Forum says, ""I can't believe we take animals from the wild and put them in cages for the entertainment of the public! We should view them on film or TV in their natural environment.,' However, this misses the point. A zoo does more than display animals to the public. It ensures their survival. Without zoos you would not be able to see many of these animals on TV or anywhere else!"	['He believes they play an important environmental role.']
What did Nicky Morgan indicate in her claim?	"Students wishing to safeguard their careers against changes in the job market should opt for science rather than arts degrees, according to a survey of undergraduates. Engineering and chemistry were considered to be the most ""future proof"", as they are courses most likely to lead to an enduring and adaptable career. Students polled by Pearson College were broadly optimistic that their chosen courses would prepare them for a world in which the job market could change dramatically during their working lives. But opinion was sharply divided over which degrees were best for future-proof careers. Eighty-two per cent of respondents believed engineering would help develop future-proof skills, with 74 per cent believing the same of chemistry and 73 per cent of computer science. But just 33 per cent of undergraduates believed history would lead to a future-proof career, and 40 per cent English. However more than two thirds of students (67 per cent) thought the world of work would be significantly different or completely unrecognizable in 20 years. The findings, published today, come after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan sparked controversy with claims that teenagers should steer clear of the arts and humanities and opt for science or math subjects if they want to access the widest range of jobs. She said that in previous decades students would only take math or science if they wanted to pursue a specific career such as medicine or pharmacy, but nowadays that ""couldn't be further from the truth"". ""If you wanted to do something different, or even if you didn't know what you wanted to do...then the arts and humanities were what you chose. Because they were useful - we were told - for all kinds of jobs. Of course now we know that couldn't be further from the truth, that the subjects that keep young people's options open and unlock doors to all sorts of careers are the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects. "" She also described math as 'the subject that employers value most' and said that pupils who study A-level math will earn 10 per cent more over their lifetime. ""These figures show us that too many young people are making choices aged 15 which will hold them back for the rest of their lives."" she said."

David Tebbutt started Computertown UK with the purpose of _ .	"Computer people talk a lot about the need for other people to become ""computer-literate."" But not all experts agree that this is a good idea. One pioneer, in particular, who disagrees is David Tebbutt, the founder of Computertown UK. Although many people see this as a successful attempt to bring people closer to the computer. David does not see _ that way. He says that Computertown UK was formed for just the opposite reason, to bring computers to people and make them ""people-literate."" David Tebbutt thinks Computertowns are most successful when tied to a computer club but he insists there is an important difference between the two. The clubs are for people who have some computer knowledge already. This frightens away non-experts, who are happier going to Computertowns where there are computers for them to experiment on, with experts to encourage them and answer any questions they have. They are not told what to do, they find out.The computer experts have to learn not to tell people about computers, but have to be able to answer all questions people ask. People don't have to learn computer terms , but the experts have to explain in plain language. The computers are becoming ""people-literate."""	['popularising computers']
Most people liked to buy books in the shop because _ .	"Mr. Green once worked in a big company. He was so busy that he couldn't do any reading. So he gave up his job and opened a bookshop in the center of the town. It wasn't big but all the books were nice and most people liked to buy some there. When the shop was closed, he could read at home. He knew a lot and many learned people were glad to make friends with him. It was Sunday and it was cold outside. Mr. Green was very busy. At nine in the evening al! the buyers left but a woman was still there. She was dressed up and seemed to be waiting for somebody there. Standing by the shelves, she looked over the books one after another, and made them in a terrible mess . Mr. Green came up to her and asked, ""Excuse me, madam. What can I do for you?"" ""Your books are not interesting at all,"" said the woman, ""I want a delicious one."" ""That's easy,"" Mr. Green smiled. He brought out a cookbook and said, ""Here you are, madam."""

The discussion should reach beyond scientific societies because _ .	"A recent study, while showing a generally positive attitude toward science, also suggests a widespread worry that it may be ""running out of control"". This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of ""controlling"" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques. The outcomes are hard to predict. Therefore, discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies. Only through the united efforts of people with hope, can we be fully safe against the misuse of science and can science best serve mankind in the future."

The colors of the flag of Great Britain now are _ .	"Sailors used to speak of a ""Jack""when they meant a flag which was set near the bow of a sailing ship. The flag showed the country to which the ship belonged. The Union Jack became the flag of Great Britain. Australia's flag has the Union Jack in the top left hand corner together with the stars of the Southern Cross. They have kept this small part of Britain on their flag because their country was first settled by people from Britain. Australia's flag is the same color as the Union Jack--red, white and blue. The act of joining together is called a ""Union"". The Union Jack was the name of the flag made when England, Scotland and Ireland joined together to make one country. It all began in 1707 when England and Scotland joined together to become one nation. A flag was made using two crosses--one for the patron saint of each country. The word ""patron"" means protector. Many centuries before the English had taken St George as their patron saint, his emblem was a red cross on a white background. The Scottish patron saint was St Andrew. In memory of him, they used a white cross on a blue background. This cross was shaped like the letter ""X"". The new flag was a mixture of both flags with two sets of crosses. When Ireland joined England and Scotland in 1800, another cross was added. St Patrich's cross of Ireland was red and also shaped like an ""X"". All three flags now made up the Union Jack."

According to the passage, in case of an emergence, people should dial _ .	"The accident at Lake Sherwood was in our backyard. An SUV had gone off the road,down a hill, and collided with a tree. When we heard the wreck, I remembered to say ""call 911"". My family was the first on the scene. Nick, my son, was on the cell phone with 911. He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly. It was a terrible scene. There had been six people in the truck, all between 15 and 17 years old. My husband and I checked all the victims, and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him. I talked with him and had him lay on the ground. When I asked him if he was hurt, he said he was sore all over. When help arrived, they asked me to stay and continue working with them. I did as Debbie Romine, .my instructor, said in class, and did what they wanted. They even said thank you before they left. The sheriff deputies came by Saturday night to get our statements and play the 911 tape back, so Nick could identify all the voices in the background. They said over and over that the way he handled the call was the best they had heard in a long time. He was calm and worked with them even when he saw his friend who had died. The Sheriff's Department is sending some people over to help us work through our emotions. The first aid and CPR course I took in January really helped me.

When Mike said those words after the match, he meant that _ .	"A small, white envelope has peeked through the branches of our Christmas tree for the past 10 years. It has no name, no identification, no inscription . My husband Mike hated Christmas. He hated the overspending and the crazy running around at the last minute for the gifts given in desperation because you couldn't think of anything else. So one year I searched for something special to give Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin was 12 and was on the school wrestling team. Shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team of poor kids. They were dressed in ragged sneakers, and presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their golden uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without helmets . Their team obviously could not afford them. We beat them hands down . Mike shook his head sadly. ""I wish just one of them could have won,"" he said. Mike loved kids and enjoyed coaching football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a sports store and bought a load of wrestling headgear and shoes. I sent them anonymously to the poor team. On Christmas Eve, I placed a small, white envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. In the years that followed, I sent a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, and a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas. The white envelope became the highlight of Christmas. Mike died last year, but on Christmas Eve I still placed an envelope on the tree. The next morning it was joined by three more. Each of our three children had placed a white envelope on the tree for their dad. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us. By Nancy W. Gavin"	['the defeat might cause the poor kids to lose faith in themselves']
When his family moved often, the author couldn't _ .	"Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold. This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children. When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own. Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow."	['stay with his friends for a long time']
Ansel asks people wishing to keep slim not to skip meals because _ .	"Lots of folks don't think about what they eat over the holiday season until January, when they stare sadly at the number on the scale and then hurry off to hit the gym, join Weight Watchers or pick up the latest diet book. It doesn't have to be that way. Health experts say you can still enjoy the holidays. ""It's OK to indulge , but it doesn't mean you have to gain weight,"" said Karen Ansel, a New York-based registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian from Denver who's also an ADA spokeswoman, added that gaining weight during the holidays and then working hard to lose it again is not good for a person's body. For starters, people interested in maintaining their weight during the holidays should keep eating on a regular schedule, the two dietitians said. Research has shown that people who skip meals -- particularly breakfast -- end up eating more throughout the day. ""Try and stick to consistent meal times so you can avoid being overly hungry,"" Crandall said. ""When you're overly hungry, you can make some bad decisions regarding what you eat. Don't starve yourself during the day waiting for that party at night -- because you'll eat too much or overeat."" Ansel suggests that you think now about the foods you really enjoy and plan to focus on those while eating less of more common fare. Be careful, too, about alcohol intake, for a couple of reasons. Alcoholic drinks, particularly the fancy ones handed out at holiday time, tend to come loaded with calories. ""It's usually what you're adding to a drink that contains the calories,"" Crandall said. Also, if you're drunk, you might forget to watch what you're eating. ""It totally lowers your inhibitions ,"" Ansel said. Other holiday eating tips, suggested by Crandall and Ansel, include: *Eat lots of vegetables, and eat them first before moving on to the other items on your plate. *Recognize that many holiday extras, like cheese or cranberry sauce, come loaded with calories. ""If those aren't your favorite foods, don't put them on your plate,"" Crandall said. *If your favorite food has a lot of calories, be sure to minimize your portion. ""Two bites cure the craving,"" Crandall said. ""After that, you're just really feeding your old habits. *After a big holiday meal, don't sink into a chair or couch. Go for a walk outdoors or participate in some other activities that help burn off some of the calories you've just eaten."	['it may make them eat more']

According to the writer, _ is of great importance to readers.	"Reading is thought to be a kind of conversation between the reader and the text. The reader puts questions to the text and gets answers. In the light of these he puts further questions, etc. For most of the time this ""conversation"" goes on below the level of consciousness. At times, however, we become aware of it. This is usually when we are running into difficulties, when mismatch is occurring between our expectations and meaning of the text. When successful matching is being experienced, our questioning of the text continues at the unconscious level. Different people converse with the text differently. Some stay very close to the words on the pages; others take off imaginatively from the words, interpreting, criticizing, analyzing and examining. The former represents a kind of comprehension which is written in the text. The latter represents higher levels of comprehension. The balance between these is important, especially for the advanced readers. There is another conversation which from our point of view is equally important, and that has nothing to do with what is read but with how it is read. We call this a ""process"" conversation as opposed to ""content"" conversation. It is concerned not with meaning but with the strategies we employ in reading. If we are advanced reader our ability to hold a content conversation with text is usually well developed but not so our ability to hold a process conversation. It is just this kind of conversation that is of importance when we are seeking to develop our reading to meet the new demands being placed upon us by studying at a higher level."

Which of the following would be the best title for this text?	"Shopping is not as simple as you may think! There are all sorts of tricks at play each time we reach out for that particular brand of product on the shelf. Colouring, for example, varies according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packaged in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colours. Ice cream packets are often blue and expensive goods, like chocolates, are gold or silver. When some kind of pain killer was brought out recently, researchers found that _ because they made the product look weak and ineffective. Eventually, it came on the market in a dark blue and white package--blue because we think of it as safe, and white as calm. The size of a product can attract a shopper. But quite often a bottle doesn't contain as much as it appears to. It is believed that the better-known companies spend, on average, 70 percent of the total cost of the product itself on packaging! The most successful producers know that it's not enough to have a good product. The founder of Pears soap, who for 25 years has used pretty little girls to promote their goods, came to the conclusion: ""Any fool can make soap, but it takes a genius to sell it."""

From the text, we can learn that the future mobile phones will _ .	Every year mobile phones develop. Imagining what they will look like and be able to do in 2020 is really a challenge. To help, experts have outlined three major mobile trends that they believe will have become reality by then. Our phones will be so smart in 10 years' time that they'll know everything about our situation and warn us when something needs our attention. This is the top prediction of both Nokia and Google. They predict that our cars and home appliances will be able to communicate with our mobile. For example, fridges will tell your mobile to tell you to pick up milk on the way back from work. While driving, your mobile will suggest that you take a different route because there's a road accident up ahead. The second trend is in gesture-based controls. People who know the iPhone's touch-sensitive screen are already familiar with the technology. It translates hand movements into actions on-screen. But gestural communications will make the phone more convenient to use and may completely replace touchpads. According to industry insiders, the most immediate step forward in gestural technology will be in voice recognition. It's believed voice recognition technology will speed up communications. It is quicker to speak than type. Eventually, phone screens will disappear. The third major development will change our understanding of a mobile phone. From a single phone, the mobile will be developed into multi-part devices. It is opposite to the current trend in which mobile phones are combining the functions of cameras, music players and game consoles. The prediction is based on the idea that the world will become more wireless and all these--cameras, music players and game consoles--will be wirelessly connected. Mobile phones won't need to contain these devices because users will be able to control them wirelessly through their phones.	"[""be controlled by the users' voices""]"
The author mainly intends to tell us_in theVrainSchool District.	"In communities north of prefix = st1 /Denver, residents are pitching in to help teachers and administrators as the Vrain school District tries to solve a $13.8 million budget shortage blamed on mismanagement . "" We're worried about out teachers and principals, and we really don't want to lose them because of this,"" one parent said,"" If we can help ease their financial burden, we will."" Teachers are grateful, but know it may be years before the district is solvent . They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it's impossible for them to solve this problem. The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. "" It's extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,"" said State Treasurer Mike Coffman. Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a $ 9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays. District officials also took $ 1.7 million from student -activity accounts of its 38 schools. At Coffman's request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district's finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a $ 212 million bond issue for schools. In Frederick, students' parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs. Some $ 36,000 has been raised in donations from Safeway. A Chevrolet dealership donated $ 10,000 and forgave the district's $ 10,750 bill for renting the driver educating cars.

What can we conclude according to the researchers?	"The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are ""rocket-boosters"" to the brain and better therapy than self-help books, researchers will say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and cause moments of self-reflection. Using scanners, they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then ""translated"" the texts into more ""straightforward"", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more ""challenging"" prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it ""lit up"" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This ""lighting up"" of the mind lasts longer than the initial electrical spark, shifting the brain to a higher gear, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, an area concerned with ""autobiographical memory"", helping the reader to reflect on and reappraise their own experiences in light of what they have read. The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self-help books. Philip Davis, an English professor who has worked on the study with the university's magnetic resonance centre, will tell a conference this week: ""Serious literature acts like a rocket-booster to the brain. ""The research shows the power of literature to shift mental pathways, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and the elderly alike."""

And the two of them said, ""It's unbelievable!"" Nine-year-old, Rubina Ali, and Azharuddin Ismail, 10, were living a very different life and obviously loving every minute of it. The two, some of the child stars of the Oscar-winning Slum dog Millionaire(<<>> )movie, know the Indian slums very well. That was where they grew up, and it is where they will return at the end of their Hollywood dream trip. But before going back home, there was an interview with the host, Ryan Seacrest. During the interview they smiled and repeated their disbelief in what was happening to them. To their surprise, their movie won first place in the Oscars. When the two received the award, it was late morning in the children's home city of Mumbai, where family, friends and many fellow residents of the slums watched the result from Hollywood. ""I don't really know what the Oscars are,"" Rubina's mother said. ""I'm just glad my daughter looks happy, though she told me she missed Indian food."" ""Our children lead a dog's life,"" Rubina's mother said, pointing out the rubbish everywhere, the open drains and the lack of education opportunities. In a few days they will be back in Mumbai and back in the slums which are their home. Fortunately, according to media reports, the movie's director, Danny Boyle, has promised to help the children chosen from the slum and make sure they will go to a proper school. The two don't need to worry about their daily lives because of the Oscar success of Slum dog Millionaire. But the poverty and lack of opportunity --the central theme of the movie--is always all around."	['They will have a better education.']

"From the context, the word ""option"" (Para.4) means _ ."	"No one gets through life without experiencing many disappointments. Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth. One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work. Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and ""good times"". The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential. Disappointments are unwelcome, but regular visitors to everyone's life. We can feel depressed about them or we can try to escape from them. The best thing, though, is to accept a disappointment and then try to use it somehow: Step over the unwelcome visitor on the doorstep and get on with life."	['choice']
During the night gorilla usually sleep in trees except _ .	An ape has a larger brain than any animal except man, though it is much smaller than a man's brain. Apes all belong to the hot countries of the world--tropical Africa and South--east Asia. The gorilla is the largest of the apes. He is as tall as six feet when standing upright. Many people think that gorillas are very fierce. They are often described as standing upright like a man, beating their fists and roaring. In their home, in the forests of Central Africa, however, they are not at all like this, They are peaceful animals and never use their great strength unless attacked. Even then, they retreat if they can. Gorillas have black faces and long, black, hairy coats. They feed during the day on plants and fruit. At night the old male often sleeps on the ground at the foot of a tree, while the others each make a sleeping platform in the tree bending the leafy branches. Besides this, gorillas climb trees very seldom.	['the old male gorilla']
What's the main idea of the passage?	"WHAT sets Spain apart from the rest of Europe? It might be ""siestas"", the three-hour lunch break that is customary in the country. The Spanish start work at 8 or 9 am, but in the early afternoon they usually take a three-hour break. After lunch, people can be seen napping in cars or on benches. During hot summer afternoons, Spanish village streets are often totally deserted . When they return to their offices at 4 pm, Spanish workers often have to make up for the lost time by working until 8 or 9 pm. So, while most other Europeans are sound asleep, Spaniards are still having dinner or watching television. ""Everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment,"" described AP. ""This work schedule is a Spanish cultural vice,"" said Nuria Chinchilla, head of the International Center on Work and Family at the University of Navarra in Barcelona. ""Changing to the European schedule should be the most urgent project for the government."" Many Spanish people complain about their never-ending workdays, and some even think the issue has affected the country's development. ""In Spain we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,"" lawmakers in the Spanish parliament wrote in a proposal. ""This has a negative effect on productivity, stress, accidents and school dropout rates."" That's why, last September, they recommended that Under the proposed newuthe government turn back the clocks by one hour. schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. And a regular eight-hour workday would be introduced. However, some doubt that changing the time zone would reverse low productivity, which comes more from the country's service-oriented economy , according to Maria Angeles Durant, a sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council. But Ignacio Buqueras, the president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that ""changing the Spanish schedule would allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economy."" The Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously, but it hasn't taken any action yet, reported The New York Times. Spain's siesta is not actually a product of its relaxed Mediterranean culture. At the start of the 20th century, Spain had the same working hours as many parts of Europe. It was during World War II that the country moved the clocks forward to align them with those of Nazi Germany. The same thing happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not."	['Spain hopes to boost its economy by changing its work schedule.']
Who gave the boy a meal box?	"It was a cold winter afternoon before Christmas. My parents and I sat on the bench in Washington, D.C. Union Station, waiting for the train. Inside the waiting hall were many people. A boy sat nearby. His worn jacket, pale face, dirty hands all seemed to tell me that he was homeless. ""He must be cold and hungry. Maybe I should help him,"" I said to myself. Just at that moment, a well-dressed young couple walked towards him. ""Excuse me,"" the man bent down. ""My wife and I bought two meal boxes but one was enough for us. We hate to waste good food. Can you help us out and put this to use?"" he handed the boy a meal box. The boy thanked them and opened the box with joy and care. Suddenly he stopped. In the direction to which he looked, I saw an old man _ in a worn sweater, worn trousers and open shoes, entering the hall. Putting the meal box aside, the boy stood and helped the old to his seat. He took off his jacket and covered it on the old man's shoulders, saying, ""A gentleman brought me this warm meal but I just finished eating. I hate to waste good food. Can you help me out?"" He placed the still-warm meal box in the old man's hands without waiting for an answer. ""Sure, son, but if only you share that sandwich with me. It's too much for a man at my age. "" We were all touched. Dad went away and soon returned with cups of hot chocolate and a big pizza. Mum and dad went up to those rags, ""Excuse me..."" I rushed into a KFC and took out my pocket money. It was so cold that afternoon but I felt much warmer than I had ever thought possible."	['The young man.']
According to Han Mengjie, which of the following is the most possible action to be taken?	"BEIJING - The country's top health officials state that an international charity's decisions not to give millions of dollars to Chinese organizations that fight AIDS and other diseases will not bring about the end of those organizations. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria announced on Monday that it will withhold $95 million from the $270 million in grants it had planned to give China. That decision came as the result of months of discussion between the charity and Chinese officials. On the mainland, a large number of programs meant to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS have received money from the Global Fund. Many observers now fear that the announced cut will undermine those organizations' work. Chen Zhu, the minister of health, said officials have found a way to limit the harm. ""In the coming five years, the Chinese government will constantly increase its financial support of social organizations, particularly those that work to control and prevent HIV/AIDS."" Chen said while addressing the 6th Experience Exchange Conference of International Cooperation Program on HIV/AIDS in China on Monday. In a recent survey of more than 200 organizations taking part in the fight against HIV/AIDS on the mainland, nearly 80 percent of them said they had received grants from the Global Fund. About 83 percent of them said they will find it difficult to continue operating without financial support from abroad, it said. Official statistics showed the Global Fund has given China $548 million in grants since 2003. Xia Jing, leader of a Beijing-based grassroots organization dedicated to controlling AIDS, said: ""We were like children fostered by foreign milk. As foreign money began to be withdrawn from China, we were faced with serious financial hardships."" Han Mengjie, executive director of Global Fund China Programs, said the Chinese government has fully recognized the important role social organizations play in controlling diseases. ""The work done and efforts made by such organizations must be sustained for a long time to supplement the government's intervention work,""he said, ""We have to face the truth that international money for AIDS control will gradually leave China and to prepare ourselves to deal with that."""

What is the next aim of Desmond on octopuses?	"It has been known that the octopus has many special skills, such as using hard shells for mobile homes and protection, disabling their suckers, plotting escapes, and even predicting World Cup soccer game outcomes. Can't we say it is a mysterious creature? While all these talents are impressive, they pale compared to its ability to ""disappear"" from plain sight. Researchers have long known that this is possible because of the presence of the organs under their skin, which expand or contract to produce a series of color1s, patterns and even skin textures in just milliseconds. Scientists had always believed that such a reaction was directed by a signal from the octopus's large, human-like eyes or brain. But a recent report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology by researchers from the University of California at Santa Barbara, indicate that the animal does not have to wait for a signal from its eyes or brain. It can ""see"" the light with its skin! UCSB doctoral student Desmond and Professor Todd said they have seen reports about octopus skin changing color1s in response to light with no signal from the eye or brain. However, there had been no follow-up to find out why this was the case and the two decided to see what they could uncover. They began by taking skin samples from a couple of California octopuses and exposing them to color1s, ranging from violent to orange and found that their skin is equipped with the same light-sensitive protein as is found in the cells in the retina of the eyes. Thanks to these proteins, the octopus can ""see"" the light and react without having to wait for a signal from the eyes or brain, thus enabling it to begin the escape process. Another research by University of Maryland researchers discovered that cuttlefish and squid share the same talent. Thanks to these findings researchers now know that their skin color1 can be controlled by both. What is still not clear is how the two come together to manage the whole process. The doctoral student plans to get to the bottom of the mystery."	['How the signals from their brain work with the proteins.']
The fat of the recommended daily allowance for women is _ grams.	A new graph has revealed exactly how long you'11 need to sweat it out in the gym to neutralize swallowing a favorite fast food. While eating fried chicken, pizza and burgers will all entail a gym session of over an hour doing cardio or lifting weights, women have it far harder than men and must work extra hard to banish calorie-packed meals. After a classic McDonald's favorite, the Big Mac, men would need to do 42 minutes of cardio or 57 minutes of weightlifting. As for women, fifty one minutes of cardio would help counter the 24 grams of fat in a Big Mac---over a quarter of the recommended daily allowance - --or an hour and eight minutes of weightlifting. However, the 450g Tesco chocolate cake was by far the worst offender. Clocking in at a whopping 1,710 calories and 90 grams of fat, only a hardcore gym session is going to shift the calories you've absorbed from this dessert. The average woman would have to lift weights for almost four hours to work off the calories in this cake. Comparatively a chocolate bar seems healthy, with 237 calories which would take 25 minutes for the average woman to run off. Alternatively you could spend thirty three minutes doing weightlifting exercises. Men will have to complete 40 minutes of cardio and 53 minutes of weightlifting while women will have to complete 48 minutes of cardio and 64 minutes of weightlifting against the calories in French fries.

When was the bridge between New York and the Long Island completed?	In 1865, a creative engineer, John Roebling, decided to build a bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However, bridge experts throughout the world thought that this was impossible and told Roebling to forget the idea. However, Roebling thought about it all the time and he knew deep in his heart that it could be done. He just had to share the dream with someone else. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington that the bridge in fact could be built. With great excitement and inspiration, and great hardships before them, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge in 1869. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. prefix = st1 /Washingtonwas injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. In spite of his handicap,Washingtonwas never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge and his mind was still as sharp as ever. Now all he could do was move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By touching his wife's arm with that finger, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. For 13 years Washingtontapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, telling the engineers what to do, until the bridge was finally completed.	['Around the early 1880s']
Which of the following happened first?	"Keving Rogers used to be my boss.At that time he always told us to sell more.As soon as I could,I left his shop and got a new job in another place.The last time I saw Rogers was more than ten years ago.At least that's what I thought.But now I am not so sure. I was on my way to my office in the centre of town.There is a small park nearby,which I sometimes walk through after lunch.The park was almost empty except for a shabby-looking man on one of those benches .The man looked about fifty years old and was wearing an old gray coat.It was cold and windy,and he was trembling . ""It's a long time since I had a meal.Can you help me?""he said.There was something about his voice that sounded familiar.I gave him a few pennies.As he went past me I looked at his face closely.I wondered where I had seen him before.Then it suddenly came to me.Could it possibly be...? No!Impossible,I thought.I watched him walking away.He was the same height as Rogers but looked a lot thinner than I remembered. Yesterday I ran into someone who had worked for Rogers at the same time as I did,and had stayed on longer.I started telling him about the man I had seen in the park.""For a moment I thought it was our old boss.But it couldn't have been.Rogers must be the head of a company now.""I said.

Where did the negative Irish stereotype come from?	On March 17 there will be an explosion of green colour across the world in celebration of St Patrick's Day. The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete, occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize. It was the Irish after all who created one of the world's best-loved beers, Guinness.	['From the behavior of Irish immigrants to the America in the 19thcentury.']
From the passage we can learn that _ .	The industrial age has been the only period of human history in which most people's work has taken the form of jobs. The industrial age may now be coming to an end, and some of changes in work patterns which it brought may have to be reversed. This seems a discouraging thought. But, in fact, it could offer the prospect of a better future for work. Universal employment, as its history show, hasn't meant economic freedom. Employment became widespread when the enclosures of the 17th and 18th centuries made many people dependent on paid work by taking them away from the use of the land, and thus from the means to provide a living for themselves. Then the factory system destroyed the cottage industries and removed work from people's homes. Later, as transport improved, first by rail and then by road, people traveled longer distances to their place of employment until, eventually, many people's work lost all connection with their home lives and the places in which they lived. Meanwhile, employment put women at a disadvantage. In pre-industrial times, men and women had shared the productive work of the household and village community. Now it became customary for the husband to go out to paid employment, leaving the unpaid work of the home and family to his wife. Tax and benefit regulations still assume this norm today, and restrict more flexible sharing of work roles between sexes. It was not only women whose work status suffered. As employment became the dominant form of work, young people and old people were kept out -- a problem now, as more teenagers disappointed and annoyed at school and more retired people want to live active lives. All this may now have to change. The time has certainly come to switch some efforts and resources away from the utopian goal of creating jobs for all, to the urgent practical task of helping many people to manage without full-time jobs.

What would be the best title for the passage?	Group exercise is one of the most effective ways to improve physical fitness and sustain a healthy lifestyle.Group exercise is challenging, yet fun and empowering! Of course everyone knows that exercise is good for the body.However, studies have shown that when exercise is performed in groups, it's not only great for improving physical health but for psychological health. It's an opportunity to be social, release endorphins , and improve your strength. Additionally, group exercise creates a community feel and the shared common goal motivates participants to work hard. The instrumental support of taking on a fitness journey with others proves more effective than going to the gym alone. Another beneficial aspect of group exercise is the informational support participants receive from the instructor.Many people fear the gym because they feel lost and don't want to embarrass themselves. If you feel you can relate, then group training is an even better option for you. It's a great opportunity to learn more about fitness through the clear instruction and supervision of a fitness instructor. If you're tired of wandering around the gym wasting time and becoming bored, !you can attend an upbeat group fitness class that'll keep your workout on track. Don't let fitness frighten you! If you're serious about wanting to live a healthy lifestyle, it's extremely important to surround yourself with people who'll provide you with the proper emotional support. I wouldn't scold anyone for deciding to party on weekends and in turn I wouldn't expect anyone to give offence to me for focusing on my health. Surround yourself with people who uplift, encourage and understand you! Make fitness even more fun by trying something new or any group fitness class, with a friend. Plan to go for a jog together. Then try a fun healthy restaurant or fresh juice bar! Fitness can be both fun and social! Surrounding yourself with people who'll provide you with respect support can be very beneficial while working towards reaching health and fitness goals. First, decide to do it for yourself and work towards staying positive. Then make sure the people you surround yourself with are supportive. Don't let negativity ruin your motivation.

Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said,"" You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say thing in anger, they have a scar just like these holes. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say 'I am sorry ', the wound is still there. A verbal wound is as bad as physical one.""

What's the right attitude towards the words like probably, many, soon?	"Uncertainty spreads through our lives so thoroughly that it dominates our language. Our everyday speech is made up in large part of words like probably, many, soon, great, little. What do these words mean?Such verbal expression is not necessarily to be criticized. Indeed, it has a value just because it allows us to express judgments when a precise quantitative statement is out of the question. We have been trying to pin down by experiments what people mean by these expressions in specific contexts, and how the meanings change with age. For instance, a subject is told ""There are many trees in the park"" and is asked to say what number the word many mean to him. Or a child is invited to take ""some"" sweets from a bowl and we then count how many he has taken. We compare the number he takes when he is alone with the number when one or more other children are present and are to take some sweets after him, or with the number he takes when told to give ""some"" sweets to another child. First, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression ""is certain to"" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; ""is likely to"", about a 60 percent chance; ""probably will"" about 55 percent. Secondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take ""a few"" or "" a lot of"" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total. Thirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age. This age effect is so consistent that it might be used as a test of intelligence."	['They are necessary since we cannot be always precise.']
Albert Einstein recommended reading fairy-tales because _ .	"Once upon a time, a doting mother asked Albert Einstein what she should read to her son to help him grow up as brilliant and intelligent as the famous scientist. ""Fairy-tales,"" he said, wisely nodding his head. Why? Why would Albert Einstein -- the Nobel Prizes winning physicist recommend reading fairy-tales? Was he joking? All the evidence suggests he was deadly serious. He also said, ""When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than any talent for abstract, positive thinking."" Childhood is one of the factors that blur the distinctions between the self and other objects. Thus fantasy stories appeal to children and appear to make sense to them. There are several commonly accepted genres of fantasy, ""Animal Fantasy"" which centers around the lives of lovable talking animals and ""Modern Fantasy"" which focuses on adventures in other worlds and magical events. I am inclined to add a third genre ""Human and Animal Fantasy"", which mixes human and animal characters. Another genre of fantasy may be ""High Fantasy"" which features heroes who combat evil and save the world from destruction. Fantasy feeds a child's imagination and encourages creativity. The enjoyment that the genre engenders promotes reading and enhances literacy. Moreover, the fantasy genre may be used for teaching purposes. For example: A story about cruelty to animals would limit appeal to a child; however a fantasy celebration of closeness between the children and their pets may give an element of excitement as the children are able to save animals from someone with cruel intentions. Children love the Harry Potter series, and if they only see the movies they miss a great opportunity to develop their reading skills by spending time with the lovable young wizards and witches of the Hogwarts community."

How many tests do teenagers have to pass before they get their license?	Mitsuaki recently arrived in the United States to enter university.He wants to do well in his studies and fit the new culture.But Mitsuaki has a problem.It's not his teachers.It's not even his English ability.His problem is that he doesn't have a car.Mitsuaki has already discovered a basic fact of American culture: Driving is a way of life. There are different transportations in America.Many cities have taxis, buses and subways. But most people find it the easiest to drive, even if they do have to deal with heavy traffic. Nowadays busy families often have more than one vehicle.Many people think their car as a status symbol.But no matter what their social status are, people without wheels feel stressed. When Mitsuaki first arrived, he was amazed at how young many American drivers there were.Young people in America often get their driver's license around age 16 by passing a written test and a driving test.Before they can get their license, they have to take a driver education course, For teenagers, being able to drive is important. It's hard to find an American teenager without one. Mitsuaki finally decides that he needs a car. His host family helps him find a good used car to buy. But before he gets his license and starts driving, he has to understand the American style of driving, He also needs to learn some of the basic rules of the road that good drivers follow. Driving to Americans is what flying to birds.It's almost part of their nature.For many Americans, being behind the wheel is like their natural home.But if they don't drive carefully, they can become an endangered animal.

The best title of this passage is _ .	If we say the four great inventions (Gunpowder,Compass,Paper and Art of Printing) reflected ancient China's scientific achievements,then Zhaozhou Stone Bridge perfectly represented one of the greatest contributions to ancient China's bridge building.Nobody was unfamiliar with the stone bridge full of legends and vivid folk stories. The ancient Zhaozhou stone bridge started to be built in 590 during the Sui Dynasty (581~618) and established in 608.The pioneer for building the bridge was Li Chun who overcame unimaginable difficulties,undergoing all hardships.The location of the bridge is in Zhao County south,Hebei Province.It lay across the Xiaoshui River,far away from the mountains that provided rocky materials.In ancient times,it was such a busy,deep and wide river that could be used as an important carriage to transport heavy rocks and other materials.As we know,no train,no lifting machine could be used to move granite blocks to the construction site.As an intelligent stonemason and engineer,Li Chun worked out his plan and design all from his own direct observation and investigation.It took his whole life-time in completing the great historical project inChina.Nowadays it is not only a historical remarkable model of architecture,but also a brilliant Chinese cultural crystallization of wisdom. The entire length of the bridge is 50.82 meters with 10 meters width.The whole stone bridge looks like a big bow,the span of which is 37.02 meters,and its height from the top to the surface of water at a regular position is 7.23 meters.The bridge arch seems to be moving smoothly and flatly.The whole arch consists of 28 big granite blocks connected each other tightly together.On both end sides of the general arch there are 4 smaller arches,2 of which on one side,the other 2 on the other side.The smaller arches could be used to decrease the weight of the bridge and save stone materials,and help flood get through easily,which seems to be much prettier.Such a hard-thinking and careful consideration of the engineering article is really a model of design and layout.The span was much wider than the other stone bridge in ancient times all over China. Today Zhaozhou Stone Bridge is one of international cultural relics and perfectly protected and preserved by the concerned administration of China.	['Zhaozhou stone bridge']
How did the little girl go to school every day?	"A little girl walked to and from school every day.Though it was not fine and clouds appeared in the sky that morning, the little girl made her daily trip to school as usual. When school was over, winds became stronger and it began to rain. The mother of the little girl felt worried that her daughter would be afraid when she walked home from school and that lightning might make her child scared. Following the bright light of lightning, the mother quickly got into her car and drove to her child's school. As the mother drove along the road, she saw her little girl walking alone in the rain. To her great surprise, she found that when a lightning came, her daughter stopped, looked up and smiled. Another lightning came and then another followed. With each lightning, the little girl stopped, looked up and smiled. Inside the car, the motherasked her daughter, ""What were you doing? Why did you look up and smile when the lightning came ?"" The little girl answered with a smile, ""Mum, you know, God was looking at me. Each time I felt a little afraid walking in the rain.God would take a picture of me. I knew he was playing a game with me''."	['On foot.']
In the author's opinion,the value of a person's life is _ .	"""I've changed my mind.I wanted to have a telescope,but now I want my dad back."" Lucien Lawrence's letter to his father for Christmas written after his father had been knifed to death outside his school gate,must have touched everyone's heart.Lucien went on to say that without his father he couldn't see the stars in the sky.When those whom we love depart from us,we cannot see the stars for a while. But Lucien,the stars are still there,and one day,when you are older and your tears have gone,you will see them again.And,in a strange way,I expect that you will find your father there,too,in your mind and heart.I find that my parents,who died years ago,still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive.I still live to please them and I'm still surprised by their reactions.I remember that when I became a professor,I was so proud,or rather so pleased with myself that I couldn't wait to cable my parents.The reply was a long time in coming,but when it did,all my mother said was ""I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!"" I haven't forgotten.The values of my parents still live on. It makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care.Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors,and to lay down my life for those in my care?How many people would want me back for Christmas?It's a serious thought,one to give me pause. I pray silently,sometimes,in the dead of night,that ancient cry of a poet ""Deliver my soul from the sword,and my darling from the power of the dog."" Yet I know the death comes to us all,and sometimes comes suddenly.We must therefore plan to live forever,but live as if we will die tomorrow.We live on,I'm sure,in the lives of those we love,and therefore we ought to have a care for what they will remember and what they will treasure.If more parents knew this in their hearts to be true,there might be fewer knives on our streets today."

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"As a middle school student, you are in an age group that is both fascinating and complex. You are no longer a ""baby"", but you are not yet an adult. You are experiencing biological, physical, and behavioral and social changes. Relationships with your friends and family take on new meanings. This time period, called adolescence, can be joyful and painful at the same time. However, it is always a time of growth. You will be dealing with more complex intellectual tasks. You will be expected to behave in a more mature manner and you will be held more responsible for your actions. In other words, you are growing up. Use your curiosity, imagination, energy, and idealism to make your school an exciting place to learn and play. As an adolescent, you now have more control over how you apply yourself to your school work and on the kinds of friends you make. As an intelligent and thinking adolescent, be aware of health risks to avoid such as involvement with drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and sexual activity. This involvement reduces your quality of life. Be kind and gentle to yourself, seek the advice and wisdom of your parents/guardians regularly, and talk with your teachers and school counselor. Middle school students are expected to be respectful and considerate of others. You are responsible for your behavior. Think of ways to improve your behavior ^in your classroom ^in the lunchroom ^on school grounds ^during school activities ^on the school bus ^in your community If you need assistance in working on ways to improve yourself as a person, contact your counselor. The counselor is trained to help students solve personal problems."	"[""It's hoped that middle school students will improve their behavior after school.""]"
What is the author's attitude towards the American Medical Association's declaration on obesity?	"Last week the American Medical Association voted, for the first time, to declare obesity a disease. How should the rest of us respond? When we meet obese people, should we cast them a knowing glance of concern and ask how they are doing? Should we send flowers and ""get well soon"" cards to obese family members and friends? Should the U.S. declare war on obesity, as we once did on cancer? If obesity truly is a disease, then over 78 million adults and 12 million children in America just got classified as sick. Yet many sensible people know that declaring obesity a disease is a mistake. Simply put, obesity is not a disease. To be sure, it is a risk factor for some diseases. Yet everyone who is obese does not get sick, and many normal-weight people do not stay healthy. I have known slim people who took good care of themselves throughout their lives yet fell ill and died young. Others who exhibited no particular interest in their health and did not watch their weight lived to an old age. In most cases, we simply cannot tell from a person's weight what lies ahead for them in life. Consider Winston Churchill. Though average in height, Churchill weighed up to 250 pounds. He smoked cigars and drank ly heavily. He did not work out. Yet he became perhaps the most important statesmen of the 20th century and one of the greatest politicians in history. He lived to age 90. Is obesity bad for people? For some, especially patients who are extremely overweight, the answer is almost certainly yes. Would many overweight people benefit from exercising more and eating less? Again, the answer is likely yes. But this does not make obesity a disease. Many people are not harmed by carrying extra pounds, some may actually benefit from it. For these reasons, we should be careful before labeling obese people diseased."	['Disapproving']
The organization Equal Exchange aims to .	"Have you ever wondered where the chocolate in your favorite candy bar comes from?Chocolate comes from the cacao tree,which grows in warm,tropical areas of West Africa,Indonesia,Malaysia,Mexico,and South America.And who eats the delicious chocolate made from the cacao grown in these places?The majority of chocolate is consumed in Europe and North America.This probably sounds like a familiar story-developing countries produce inexpensive raw materials that are manufactured and sold as finished goods in developed countries,and generally,that is what happens with chocolate.Large chocolate companies buy cacao beans at a low price and produce cocoa and chocolate products to sell at a ly high price. But the familiar story has a new chapter.Beginning in the 1980s,some consumers learned that cacao farmers were living difficult and uncertain lives.The farmers received money for their crops based on world markets,and the market price for cacao was sometimes so low that farmers received less for their crops than the crops had cost to produce.In response,groups of consumers in Europe and the United States developed""fair trade""organizations to guarantee that farmers of cacao,as well as coffee and tea,would receive fair and consistent prices for their crops. Fair trade organizations benefit farmers by buying cacao beans or other products from them directly at higher-than-market prices and eliminating ""middle men""such as exporters.Fair trade organizations also encourage farming techniques that are not harmful to the environment or to farm workers,for example,growing cacao without chemical pesticides or fertilizers in the shade of rain forest trees.One organization,Equal Exchange,helps farmers set up farming cooperatives in which they can share resources and work on projects such as community schools.Another,Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (FLO),guarantees that products bearing its label meet standards that improve the lives of growers and producers. The results of fair trade are a better standard of living for some farmers and nicer chocolate bars made with organically produced cocoa that consumers don't feel guilty about buying.And although fair trade chocolate is somewhat more expensive than other chocolate and now makes up only 1% of chocolate sold,the fair trade idea is spreading quickly.You may soon see fair trade chocolate right next to the more famous bars in your favorite store."

Which one of the following is NOT right according to this passage?	Doctors say obesity,also known as severe overweight,is a complex condition.A doctor may advise medical interventions in addition to changes in behavior.But experts say the more successful weightloss plans include a wellbalanced diet and exercise. People who want to avoid weight gain have to balance the number of calories they eat with the number of calories they use.To lose weight,you can reduce the number of calories you take in,or increase the number you use,or both.Experts at the National Institutes of Health say to lose weight,a person should do some moderate or intensive physical exercise most days of the week.This could include fast walking,sports or strength training. A recent study looked at four of the most popular dieting plans in the United States.Researchers at Stanford University studied more than three hundred overweight women,mostly in their thirties or forties.Each woman went on one of the four plans:Atkins,The Zone,Ornish or LEARN.The women attended diet classes and received written information about the food plans.At the end of a year,the women on the Atkins diet had lost the most,more than four and a half kilograms on average. Christopher Gardner led the study,reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He said the Atkins diet may be more successful because of its simple message to lower the intake of sugar.Also,he said the advice to increase protein in the diet leads to more satisfying meals. But last week,another report suggested that only a small minority of people have longterm success in dieting.Researchers at the University of California found that most dieters regained their lost weight within five years.And often they gained back even more.But those who kept the weight off generally were the ones who exercised.

The author's purpose in writing the text is to advise readers to _ .	This is a true story. Tristin Saghin enjoyed the movie Black Hawk Down very much,which is about the conflict in Somalia.The battle scenes and the exciting rescues of people who are dying,interested him greatly. There was just one problem:Tristin was only 9 years old,and it was thought that movie was not for children. When his parents caught him watching it on TV,they made him turn it off,though he had finished his homework and it was not late. Then one day,Tristin and his family were visiting his grandmother in Mesa,Arizona. Tristin's 2yearold sister got out of the house and fell in the backyard pool. Realizing the little girl was missing,the family ran outside,only to find the girl had fallen into the water. Pulled from the pool and placed on the ground,the child wasn't breathing. The family called the ambulance ,but no one knew how to do first aid. No one,that is,except for Tristin. A scene in Black Hawk Down describes a doctor giving first aid. Tristin remembered it. Then the 9yearold gave first aid to his sister at once and saved her life. His parents don't stop him seeing the movies he likes any more. Tristin taught himself how to do first aid but he had never thought he could use it to save his little sister's life. Any skill can be used in time,so you should always learn.	['learn more skills']
Martha felt extremely shy because of her_.	"Mr. Hadley was my 6th grade teacher. At that time I was a short girl weighing 70 kilograms. Boys always laughed at me because of it. So I became an extremely shy young lady. One day Mr. Hadley told us that we would be required to come to the front of the class and read the reports that we had completed. When my turn came, I refused to stand in front of all those students and open up to their tricks. Mr. Hadley handed me my report and asked me to read it. I gave it back to him. He walked to the front and said,""Martha has a very good report here and I think everyone needs to hear her read it. If you make strange noises or make fun of her in any way, I will let you fail right here and now. OK?"" Mr. Hadley walked back to me and handed me the paper again, asking me to go to the front of the class. I walked there on legs that were shaking and I felt a rabbit in my chest. Everyone was all quiet, including those boys. I stood there trying to be calm. Mr. Hadley walked over to me and put his arm around me,""You can do it. I have confidence in you!"" His words helped me calm down. I read the report and instead of the kids laughing at me and making fun of me, they all stood up and clapped their hands. From that day on the kids never made fun of me any more and some actually made friends with me. I continued to be quite shy all through school but I knew if I had to stand up in front of the class, I could do it."	['appearance']
On receiving an e-mail, Europeans tend to _ .	"The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, ""England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'"". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a ""Hi"" and end with a ""Bye"". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an ""xoxo"" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal ""Dear Mr. X"" and ending with a simple ""Sincerely"". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: ""Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak."" ""Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?"" ""Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail"". ""In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information."" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully worded bits of Euromail, then I say, ""Bring it on."""	['take more time than Americans to respond to it']
Which parts are included in the writing section of SAT according to the passage?	If you are a high school senior graduating and looking to enter college in 2006, you will take the new exam. The biggest change to the SAT will be the introduction of a new writing section. The writing section will consist of two parts: an essay and a multiple-choice section. Students will be given 25 minutes to respond to a prompt and construct a well-organized essay that effectively deals with the task. The essay question may require students to complete a statement, to react to a quote, or to agree or disagree with a point of view. In any case, a good essay will support the chosen position with specific reasons and examples from literature, history, art, science, current affairs, or even a student's own experiences. Essays will be scored based on the procedures for the current SAT II: Writing Test. Essays will be graded by two independent readers On a scale of 1~6, and their two scores will be combined to form an essay subscore that ranges from 2 to 12. Should the readers' scores vary by more than 2 points, a third reader will score the essay; The readers will be high school teachers and college professors who teach composition. To ensure that essays will be scored in a timely manner, they will be scanned and made available to readers on the Internet for grading purpose. The writing section will also include multiple-choice grammar and usage questions. Some of these questions will call upon students to improve given sentences and paragraphs. Others will present students with sentences and require them to identify mistakes in diction , grammar, sentence construction, subject-verb agreement, proper word usage. The highest possible score on the new writing section will be 800. Scores on the essay and multiple-choice section will be combined to produce a single score. A writing subscore will also be assigned. The highest possible scores on the Critical Reading and Math sections will remain 800 each, making 2,400 a perfect score on the new SAT.

. Which of the following is correct?	At first all films were in black and white, but in 1932 the first color film was made. It proved as unpopular as making films had done in the late 1920's. It was not until 1938 that a full length color film was made, and the success of this film made producers everywhere change from black and white to color. This first full-length color film was translated into ten different languages and made Hollywood the main center( )of film industry In the early days of the cinema, other countries had also film industries. Very good films were made in Sweden, Britain, Russia and France. However, because Holleywood had so much money to spend, it kept its position as the world's most important film center. Film actors went to America because they knew they could get a lot of money for every film they made. In 1918 Charlie Chaplin (*)received $5 each day. However, life was not always easy for the film actors. Newspapermen followed them everywhere, and after Charlie Chapine married for the fourth time he became so unpopular with the American public that he had to leave the country and live in Europe.

What had not changed much over the many years according to the passage?	"While surfing television channels over the weekend,a scene from a family classic of last year portraying the now-so-familiar sorry state of retired parents being ill-treated by their children and families caught my attention. I wondered why the description of this relationship had not changed much over the many years! Even though the same movies and soaps accurately capture several other social changes around us -- from value systems to new found economic freedom to the importance of technology and the changing approach to consumerism -- are these creative efforts far from the truth in telling us that an average retiree is still struggling? Look around and you will agree that the post-retired lifestyle for an ex-salaried class people is often a pale shadow of their last working years. Even self employed people, who have handed over the responsibility to the next generation, are no exception. Did the average middle class not save enough through his working years? Socially, we already know that the Indians are taught the benefits of start saving early on in life. Household savings data supports this social behavior -- India has the highest rates of savings among various economies and is far ahead of the west. Yet, tragically, a lifetime of savings does not seem to provide enough for a comfortable retirement! A closer look at the pattern of what we do with our financial savings may tell us a bit more. Over half of households' financial savings is put into a ""safe"" deposit, followed by large portions in insurance, pension, provident funds and the rest in physical currency. Less than a tenth goes into ""risky"" assets like stocks. While there might be nothing, in particular, worrisome in this investment pool, one has to consider inflation . The real value of savings, over a few decades, may actually be lower than the starting point."	['The poor situation of retirees']
On what basis did Dr Barabasi's research team draw conclusions that getting a post at a higher-rank university won't help scholastic impact?	Most academics would view a post at an elite university like Oxford or Harvard as the crowning achievement of a career--bringing both honour and access to better wine cellars. But scholars desire such places for reasons beyond glory. They believe perching on one of the topmost branches of the academic tree will also improve the quality of their work, by bringing them together with other geniuses with whom they can collaborate and who may help spark new ideas. This sounds reasonable. Unfortunately,as Albert Laszlo Barabasi of Northeastern University,in Boston (and also, it must be said, of Harvard), shows in a study published in Scientific Reports, it is not true. Dr Barabasi and his team examined the careers of physicists who began publishing between 1950 and 1980 and continued to do so for at least 20 years. They ranked the impact of the institutions these people attended by counting the number of citations each institution's papers received within five years of publication. By tracking the association of individual physicists and counting their citations in a similar way, Dr Barabasi was able to work out whether moving from a low to a high-ranking university improved a physicist's impact. In total, he and his team analysed 2,725 careers. They found that, though an average physicist moved once or twice during his career, moving from a low-rank university to an elite one did not increase his scientific impact. Going in the opposite direction, however, did have a small negative influence. The consequence is that elite university do not,at least as far as physicists are concerned,add value to output. That surprising conclusion is one which the authorities in countries such as Britain, who are seeking to concentrate expensive subjects such as physics in fewer, more elite institutions--partly to save money, but also to create what are seen as centers of excellence--might wish to consider.

The information of the global climate conditions in the past can be obtained through _ .	"The scene in the Hollywood movie The Day After Tomorrow, when global warming could soon turn the global climate into a new ice age, may never occur, according to a new research. The next ice age could be 15,000 years away, say European scientists who last month announced a continuous record of 740,000 years of climate data obtained from the Antarctic ice. Scientists from 10 nations have now almost completely drilled through a 3,000-meter depth of ice high in the Antarctic mainland. They figure out that the area, where summer temperatures can fall to - 40degC, has at least 900,000 years of snowfalls, kept as neatly as the growth rings of a tree. And the ice and air caught in each layer have begun to answer questions about the climates in the past.. The results show that there have been eight ice ages in the past 740, 000 years and eight warmer periods. And by comparing the pattern of global conditions today with those of the past, the researchers reported in Nature that the present warm period could last another 15, 000 years. Research suggests that there is a very close connection between greenhouse gas levels and global average temperatures. It also shows that carbon dioxide levels are the highest for at least 440,000 years. ""If people say to you: 'the greenhouse effect is a good thing because we would go into an ice age otherwise,' our data say no, a new ice age is not hanging over our heads,"" said Eric Wolff from the British Antarctic Survey. ""Now we have eight examples of how the climate goes in and out of ice ages... and you can learn what the rules are that go into the climate models that tell us about the future."" Scientists found that whenever temperatures rose in the frozen record, so did carbon dioxide level. ""In 440,000 years we have never seen greenhouse gas get as thick as it is today,"" said Dr Wolff."

How do Little Free Libraries get their books?	"The sharing economy has grown in recent years to include everything from apartment' sharing to car sharing to community tool sharing. Since 2009, a new form of sharing economy has been emerging in neighborhoods throughout the US and around the world-Little Free Library. The libraries are boxes placed in neighborhoods from which residents can withdraw and deposit books. Little Free Libraries come in all shapes and sizes. Some libraries also have themes, focusing on books for children, adults, or tour guides. In 2009. Tod Bol built the first Little Free Library as a gift to his mother, who was a devoted reader. When he saw the people of his community gathering around it, exchanging conversation as well as books, he knew he wanted to take his simple idea further. ""I think Little Free Libraries open the door to conversations we want to have with each other,"" Bol said. .

According to a survey, 90% of some people's purchases are made on the computer. As they find that by being able to go online and choose the things that they need to choose, and have them delivered right to their doorsteps, they could no longer be bothered with driving, the crowds, the noise of that, and they usually get a better selection. Cornell University Marketing Professor, MeLaughlin says traditional stores can keep their customers by offering goods like clothing, which customers may want to see and try on before purchasing, as well as items that are difficult to ship. He says some traditional stores are also pleasing customers with services that set up or repair computers and electronics. Traditional stores also offer a social experience that some shoppers enjoy. There is still a lot of emotion in the buying decision that takes place. Oftentimes, you need that last sense of ""this is exactly what I want"" before you part with money. And you can't always get that online. It's a rather cold process. As more and more people have Internet access and smart phones, online commerce is likely to continue its growth here in the United States and in other countries."

The writer's mother started working on very Saturday because she _ .	"I was born into a family of five children. As the youngest child, I didn't have many new clothes. Though my parents worked very hard, we could hardly make ends meet. The only time we would receive new clothes was at Christmas. The family across the street lived a much better life. They just had two daughters and they were often seen wearing new dresses. The younger girl named Anna was of my age. One afternoon, she walked on the street wearing a beautiful white dress. She looked like an angel in that dress. I, together with many little girls, followed her. We just couldn't keep our eyes off her dress. We all wished we would have such a dress one day! That day, after coming back, I told my mom that I wanted a dress like that. My mom frowned she thought such a beautiful dress like that must cost an arm and a leg, but my mom kept that in mind. She worked five days a week at that time, but when Christmas was getting close, she worked even on every Saturday. However, several days before Christmas, I changed my mind. It was Anna's birthday that day and I was invited to her home with some other girls. After that party, I asked if I could try on her white dress. ""Of course,"" she said, ""and you can take it if you like it."" I couldn't believe my ears. How could she give such a beautiful dress to someone else? After trying it on, I knew why. The dress looked beautiful, but it was uncomfortable to wear. As a matter of fact, my back was quite itchy after I put it on. From that day on, I stopped admiring what others had. They may not be as good aswe think."	['wanted to buy the dress the writer wanted']
The scientist wanted to know _ .	Long long ago, an old scientist made a few tests on different animals to find out which was the cleverest of all the animals. In one test the old scientist put a monkey in a room. In the room there were many boxes. Some boxes were inside other boxes. The smallest box had some food in it. The scientist wanted to watch the monkey and to find out how long it would take the monkey to find the food. The scientist left the room. He waited for a few minutes outside the door. Then he put his eye to the keyhole . What did he see? To his surprise, he found himself looking into the eye of the monkey. The monkey was on the other side of the door and looked at the scientist through the keyhole.	['which animal was cleverer than other animals']

So he began to look for someone to take his place. But who could he trust for the job? He thought for a while and got an idea. He would let the flowers decide. He gave everyone a little seed . The one who could grow the most beautiful flower from the seed would be the next leader. A girl called Serena was very beautiful and wanted to grow the most beautiful flower. She planted it in a nice pot and took great care of it, but nothing would grow. The next year she saw everyone come to the palace with pots full of beautiful flowers.

What did the author do to make up for his mistake?	"I have forgotten the name of an old lady who was a customer on my paper route when I was a twelve-year-old boy back in 1954. Yet it seems like just yesterday that she taught me a lesson in forgiveness that I can only hope to pass on to someone else someday. On a Saturday afternoon, a friend and I were throwing rocks onto the roof of the old lady's house. I found a smooth rock and sent it. The stone headed straight for a small window on the old lady's back door. At the sound of broken glass, we took off from the old lady's yard. I was too scared about getting caught that first night. However, a few days later when I was sure that I hadn't been discovered, I started to feel guilty for her misfortune. I decided to save my paper delivery money, and in three weeks I had the seven dollars that I thought would cover the cost of her window. I put the money in an envelope with a note explaining that I was sorry for breaking her window. Then I put the envelope through the letter slot in her door. My soul felt redeemed and I couldn't wait for the freedom of, once again, looking straight into the old lady's eyes. The next day, I. handed the old lady her paper. She thanked me for the paper and said, ""Here, I have something for you. "" It was a bag of cookies. I thanked her and ate the cookies as I continued my route. After several cookies, I felt an envelope and pulled it out of the bag. When I opened the envelope, I was shocked. Inside was the seven dollars and a short note that said, ""I'm proud of you.

Douglas Hewitt, 85, has celebrated every Christmas with the artificial tree since he was born. His father bought the tree from a toy shop in Sheffield just months after Douglas was born. The four-foot tree remains the centre point of the Hewitt family household during every festive season. Mr. Hewitt, of South Anston, South Yorkshire, said, ""It reminds us of my childhood, our children's childhood and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's after that. They all come and look at it and smile; it's become part of the furniture. If we didn't put that Christmas tree up, it wouldn't feel like Christmas.""

According to the passage, it is safe to watch a lunar eclipse, unlike a solar eclipse, because _ .	Many people are aware of the beauty of a solar eclipse , but are surprised to learn that lunar eclipses are often just as impressive. While total solar eclipse lasts only for a few minutes and can be seen only in a small area of a few kilometers, total lunar eclipse can last for several hours and can be seen over much of the planet. In fact, the beauty and _ of lunar eclipses make them a favorite of both amateur and professional photographers. Lunar eclipses generally occur two or three times a year, and are possible only when the Moon is full. When we see the Moon, we are actually seeing sunlight reflected off the surface of the Moon When the Earth is positioned in between the Moon and the Sun, however, the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, and a lunar eclipse occurs. The type of lunar eclipse - total, partial, or penumbral - that occurs depends both on how much of the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow and through which part of the shadow it passes. A penumbral eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the Earth's outer shadow. This type of eclipse is brief and frequently goes unobserved by all but astronomers. By contrast, total and partial eclipses occur when all or part, respectively, of the Moon passes through the umbra shadow of the Earth. These eclipses are quite easy to see and are widely observed. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to watch. Solar radiation that occurs during an eclipse of the Sun can cause a form of burns of one's eyes known as eclipse blindness. In fact, the only way to safely view a solar eclipse is by using specially designed equipment. However, since the Moon's light is reflected sunlight, it is completely safe to watch a lunar eclipse without any special equipment, although a pair of binoculars can certainly help the viewer appreciate the beauty of this phenomenon	['moonlight is less strong than sunlight']
How did Pete spend his holiday in the past?	Last week I visited my friend Pete in the new home where he lives with his wife and daughter. Pete used to spend his holidays travelling the world, visiting the pyramids in Egypt or scuba diving in the Caribbean. Nowadays he prefers to spend his holidays and weekends making his house look more beautiful. Like hundreds of thousands of other British people, he has discovered the joy of DIY (Do It Yourself), which means if there are any things that need fixing around the house, he will try to do the job himself. As he showed me the new kitchen he put together by himself and the newly painted walls, I asked Pete where he got his inspiration from. He told me that his favorite source of ideas was a DIY program on TV. This got me thinking about the great popularity of DIY programs in the UK. Each major channel has at least one home or garden improving show and there's even a satellite channel completely about the subject. I guess it is not really surprising that DIY programs are so popular. Two common sayings in Britain- 'an Englishman's home is his castle' and 'there's no place like home'-show how important our houses are to us. With the present economic downturn, many people can't afford to buy a bigger house so they are looking at how they can make their house better without spending a lot of money. DIY is the perfect choice. But be careful! I read a report that said over 230,000 people were injured while doing home improvements in the UK in just one year, including 41,000 who fell off ladders and 5,800 who were seriously hurt by hammers. So I won't be going down to the hardware store.	['Travelling around the world.']

How many ways to stop the virus are mentioned in the passage?	Last March, the H7N9 virus hit Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and so on. It seemed that most people who were infected with H7N9 had the common flu . Some people suffered from a fever or a cough. Don't be afraid--it's not easy to be infected with the virus. Here is some advice to help you protect yourself when it comes. Wash your hands. You need to wash your hands with soap and hot water before you eat, after you use the toilet, and after you touch animals, because your hands may carry viruses. Cover your nose and mouth. When someone sneezes or coughs, flu viruses can travel as far as one meter through the air, so you'd better stand a proper distance while talking to someone who has a cold. And always cover your mouth and nose with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough, and then clean your hands. Wear a mask . Some doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 80%, but if you don't wash your hands often, it's no use wearing a mask. And it's necessary to wear the mask in the groups of people. Do sports often. Exercises will help make your body strong enough to resist the virus.	['Four.']

What do you think of the customer?	Last month the manager of a jewelry shop ( ) received a letter. As he was very busy then, the letter lay on his desk till tea-time. He opened it and a 10-pound note( ) fell out onto the desk. Within the note was a letter which said: Dear sir: In 1935 I got engaged( ). But unfortunately I lost my job. At the time a lot of people were out of work. Six months later I got a job again, but of course I was very short of money. I came to your shop to buy a wedding ring( ). The assistant took out some rings for me to look at, but she was called away for a moment, and I put one of the rings in my pocket. When she came back, I said I didn't know the size of my girl's finger. So I left the shop without buying a ring. My wife died a short while ago and the fact that I never paid for the ring has been heavy in my heart all these years. At that time, the ring cost 2 pounds so I think it is 10 pounds at today's price and I'm sending 10 pounds. Yours truly, A customer ( )	['Honest']
The story happened _ .	"While I was waiting outside my wife's office building for her to get out of work, I saw a beggar coming my way from across the parking lot. ""I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,"" I thought. He didn't. He came and sat in front of the bus stop, but he didn't look like he could have enough money to ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke. ""That's a pretty car,"" he said, pointing to my car. He was ragged , but he had an air of dignity about himself. I gave him a smile and continued cleaning my car. He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected asking for money never came. As the silence between us widened, it seemed that a voice inside me said, ""Ask him if he needs any help."" I was sure that he would say ""yes"", but I listened to the inner voice. ""Do you need any help?"" I asked. He answered in three simple but meaningful words that I shall never forget. We often look for wisdom in great men and women, and we expect it from those of higher learning and achievements. I expected nothing but a dirty hand from him, but he said three words that shook me. ""Don't we all?"" he said. I was feeling high, successful and important above a beggar in the street, until those three words hit me like a shot. Don't we all? I needed help. Maybe not for a bus fare or for a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only for a bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, no matter how much you have achieved, you need help, too. No matter how little you have, no matter how loaded you are with problems, even without money or a place to sleep, you can give help."	['outside an office building']
What is the women teachers' attitude towards the boys?	"Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study. Women teachers are always saying that boys are ""silly"" in class. They refuse to ""sit nicely like girls"" and are more likely to be addicted to ""schoolboy tricks"".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers. The researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, ""By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea. There are signs that these expectations have the potential to become self-fulfilling in influencing children's achievement. Boys are really held back by their women teachers."""

Why are Anne and Gilbert enemies? Because _ .	"One day Marilla said, ""Anne, your new teacher, Miss Stacy, spoke to me yesterday. She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!"" ""That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.""So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now. For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew. ""Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,"" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day. ""You're right, Rachel!"" said Marilla in surprise. ""And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla."" ""Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,"" said Marilla, smiling. ""And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well."" ""Well, thank you, Rachel,"" replied Marilla, pleased. That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying. ""What's the matter?"" he asked, surprised. ""You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when."" ""It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,"" said Marilla. ""I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away."" ""When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train."" ""I'll still miss her,"" said Marilla sadly."" In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations. ""Oh, I do hope that I've done well,"" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. ""The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!"" Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her. Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, ""Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!"" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak. ""Well, now, I knew it,"" said Matthew with a warm smile. ""You've done well, I must say, Anne,"" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased. For the next three weeks Anne and Marilla were very busy. Anne needs new dresses to take to Charlottetown."

What's the best title of the text?	"Eating foods high in trans-fats(fats present in artificial form in industrially-produced cakes and fast food...) and saturated fats increases the risk of depression, according to a Spanish study, confirming previous studies that linked ""junk food"" with the disease. Researchers also showed that some products, such as olive oil, can fight against the risk of mental illness. Authors of the wide-reaching study, from the universities of Navarra and Las Palmas, followed and analyzed the diet and lifestyle of over l2,000 volunteers over six years. When the study began, none of the participants had been diagnosed with depression; by the end, 657 of them were new sufferers. ""Participants with an increased consumption of trans-fats presented up to a 48 percent increase in the risk of depression when they were compared to participants who did not consume these fats,"" the head study author said. ""The more trans-fats were consumed, the greater harmful effect they produced in the volunteers."" The research team found, at the same time, that after assessing the effect of polyunsaturated fats made up of larger amounts of fish and vegetable oils and olive oil, these products are associated with a lower risk of suffering depression. The report, published in the online journal PLOS ONE, noted the research was performed on a European population that enjoys a relatively low intake of trans-fats--making up only 0.4 percent of the total energy taken in by the volunteers. ""Despite this, we observed an increase in the risk of suffering depression of nearly 50 percent,"" said researcher Miguel Martinez. ""On this basis we think it of great importance to take this effect into account in countries like the United States, where the percentage of energy _ from these fats is around 2.5 percent."" The report pointed out that the current number of depression sufferers in the world is around l50 million people, and has increased in recent years. This rise is attributable, according to the authors, ""to great changes in the sources of fats consumed in Western diets, where we have replaced certain types of beneficial fats in nuts, vegetable oils and fish with the saturated and trans-fats found in meats, butter and other products such as mass-produced cakes and fast food."""

The passage suggests that _ .	In 1939 two brothers, Mac and Dick McDonald, started a drive-in restaurant in San Bernardino, California. They carefully chose a busy corner for their location. They had run their own businesses for years, first a theater, then a barbecue restaurant, then another drive-in. But in their new operation, they offered a new, shortened menu: French fries, hamburgers, and sodas. To this small selection they added one new idea: quick service,no waiters or waitresses, and no tips. Their hamburgers were sold for fifteen cents. Cheese was another four cents. Their French fries and hamburgers had a remarkable uniformity , for the brothers had developed a strict routine for the preparation of their food, and they insisted on their cooks' sticking to their routine. Their new drive-in became surprisingly popular, particularly for lunch. People drove up by the hundred during the busy noontime. The self-service restaurant was so popular that the brothers had allowed ten copies of their restaurant to be opened. They were content with this modest success until they met Ray Kroc. Kroc was a salesman who met the McDonald brothers in 1954 when he was selling milkshake-mixing machines. He quickly saw the special attraction of the brothers' fast-food restaurants and bought the right to franchise other copies of their restaurants. The agreement included the right to duplicate the menu, the equipment, even their red and white buildings the golden arches . Today McDonald's is really a household name. In 1976, McDonald's had over$1 billion in total sales. Its first twenty-two years is one of the most surprising successes in modern American business history.

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"The ""Bystander Apathy Effect"" was first studied by researchers in New York after neighbors ignored--and in some cases turned up the volume on their TVs--the cries of a woman as she was murdered (over a half-hour period). With regard to helping those in difficulty generally, they found that: (1) women are helped more than men; (2) men help more than women; (3) attractive women are helped more than unattractive women. Other factors relate to the number of people in the area, whether the person is thought to be in trouble through their own fault, and whether a person sees himself as being able to help. According to Adrian Furnham, Professor of University College, London, there are three reasons why we tend to stand by doing nothing: (1) ""Shifting of responsibility""-the more people there are, the less likely help is to be given. Each person excuses himself by thinking someone else will help, so that the more ""other people' there are, the greater the total shifting of responsibility. (2) ""'Fear of making a mistake''-situations are often not clear. People think that those involved in an accident may know each other or it may be a joke, so a fear of embarrassment makes them keep themselves to themselves. (3) ""Fear of the consequences if attention is turned on you, and the person is violent."" Laurie Taylor, Professor of Sociology at London University, says: ""In the experiments I've seen on intervention , much depends on the neighborhood or setting. There is a silence on public transport which is hard to break. We are embarrassed to draw attention to something that is happening, while in a football match, people get involved, and a fight would easily follow. "" Psychotherapist Alan Dupuy identifies the importance of the individual: ""The British as a whole have some difficulty intervening, but there are exceptional individuals in every group who are prepared to intervene, regardless of their own safety: These would be people with a strong moral code or religious ideals."""

Often, we pay no attention to how many different ways it can be used. The pumpkin is a wonder vegetable. It includes vitamins A, C, E, fiber, minerals and so on. It is also low in salt. When buying your pumpkins, always get them from your local farmers to support their business and the environment, also you can make sure that they are freshly grown. If you are feeling interested, you can grow your own pumpkins! When carving your jack-o'-lanterns, don't throw away the seeds! They are delicious when they are fried, which is healthy for you. When your jack-o'-lantern is useless, don't throw it away at once. Instead, put it in a certain place and let nature do all the work. Be sure to remove the candle inside, and cut the pumpkin into pieces. Those remaining parts will help your soil. Make a pie--a great way to bring family and friends together. If you are feeling even more interested, try cooking something new with the pumpkins and see what wonderful delicious dishes you can produce in your very own kitchen. And don't think of the pumpkin just around Halloween--it's great all year round.	['it benefits both the farmers and the environment']
According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	When many people in the west think of China, the animal that they think of is the dragon. For them, the dragon is an aggressive monster that breathes fire. Many popular legends tell how dragons have killed brave knights and eaten beautiful young girls. For Chinese people, however, the dragon is not an evil monster. It's a cultural and spiritual symbol for prosperity and good luck. The dragon's main task is to create harmony and bring rain. Dragons are celebrated in art and architecture, and of course the dragon dance is a very popular ritual . China isn't the only country to have the dragon as its symbol. Wales in the UK, has a red dragon proudly displayed on its flag. Another country in the world with a dragon on its flag is Bhutan, a tiny country between China and India. Almost all countries in the world have an animal symbol representing their countries. This is particularly obvious during sports. The English think lions to be brave and proud animal and the English football teams have three lions on their football shirts. Australia is famous for kangaroos, of course. The national rugby team is more commonly known as the Wallabies, a type of small kangaroo.The South African team is known as the Springboks, a type of African antelope. Likewise the New Zealanders, whether playing sports or not, are commonly known as kiwis. A kiwi is a native New Zealand bird that can't fly. All countries are proud of their symbols, which they feel reflect national characteristics or the beauty and variety of their natural environments. Recently, a Shang hai professor claimed that using the dragon as a national symbol could make western countries have a negative view of China. But in an Internet survey 90% of Chinese people wanted to keep the dragon.	['The dragon is mentioned to have been used on the flag in two countries.']
What can be inferred from the passage?	"Education is another area where the presence of arts and crafts is more than welcome. If children realize the importance of art and creativity from a young age, they can grow up to be more confident, more creative, and definitely more mature. Schools are the breeding grounds for future painters and movie makers, and these arts should be encouraged wholesomely in such an environment. Sadly, many parents do not understand why art is important for children, and subconsciously force them to follow career paths that are common and conformist in nature. This is fair enough in its own way, because the world does need some standard blue collar and white collar jobs to continue its existence; but this is a choice that children should be allowed to make for themselves. The doors to creativity and expression must not be shut in their faces, even if it comes at a cost of making more money. To put it more scientifically, here are some benefits of kids' art activities that give a suitable answer to the question ""Why is art important in schools?"" 1.Exposure to art, music and drawings at an early age improves the amount of brain activity in children. 2.It increases the span of knowledge in the minds of children, thus making them sharper and more educated. 3.It builds up the levels of self-confidence, self-esteem , motivation, cooperation and communication in children. 4.It helps children understand other people's opinions and points of view as well. 5.It helps them sharpen their problem-solving skills, decision-making and gives them the possibility of really exploring their imaginations."

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Many people think heroes need to be handsome, rich, or very smart. But as for me, a hero is a person who always helps others. My hero is Uncle Bill. He is the oldest son of a worker, and he grew up in a poor family with four younger brothers and two little sisters. He was good at neither writing nor math. In fact, he never did well in school. so he had to give up school at a very young age. He worked and gave all his money to help his parents. When he was getting older, he found that he was very interested in fixing things. he collected broken things which people threw away and fixed them into good ones. He could fix almost everything that did not work. He worked hard never gave up. Finally, he opened his own repair shop. It took him about 20 years to become a successful shopkeeper . Now, he is very rich and has four shops. But he never forgets the days when he had nothing. He gives money to poor families, helps poor kids buy books and offers them free lunch. He also encourages people to reuse things. He always says :Make good use of what you have because we just have one earth. I am proud of Uncle Bill. He is really a hero.

Supporters of the present emphasis on research argue that _ .	"For the most part, schools are designed to produce people who fit into society, not people who set out to change it. However, schools, particularly universities, may not only spread culture; they may add to the cultural heritage. Today American society places a good deal of emphasis on the development of new knowledge, especially in the physical and biological sciences, medicine, and engineering. In recent years, the nation's leading universities have increasingly become research centres. An emphasis on research has led universities to judge professors not by abilities as teachers, but as researchers. Promotions, salary increases, and other benefits have long been dependent on research and publication. However, the most important is no longer publishing. To be successful these days, professors have to bring in money provided by government and private industry. Critics claim that academic success is most likely to come to those who have learned to ""ignore"" their teaching duties to pursue research activities. Defenders say that even when students themselves are not involved in research projects they benefit from such an emphasis on research. Major research universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have also cooperated with industrial companies to develop technology and products with commercial potential. With university-industry ties continuing to grow, debate has increased about the consequences for basic science, academic openness, the control of information, the direction of research, and the influence on students."

Which is true according to the passage?	"Car companies are developing vehicles that will plug into electric sockets,just like many laptops,digital cameras,cell phones and Mp4 do.Called""plug-in vehicles"",these cars will get most of their power from electricity. Their drivers won't have to stop at gas stations as often as usual. The technology is more than just cool. In our car-filled world,plug-in vehicles could reduce the amount of gas we use,which keeps rising in cost now and then. Besides,driving around in these vehicles may even help the environment.Gas-burning cars produce a lot of greenhouse gas,which causes globe warming. The first company-produced plug-in vehicles could hit the roads by 2010. But engineers still have a lot of work to do to make the technology practical and inexpensive. Batteries are the biggest challenge. In the plug-in-vehicle world,Li-ion batteries are getting the most attention.These batteries can store a large amount of energy in a small package,and they last a longer time between charges.Li-ion batteries can fit laptops,cell phones,heart instruments and other similar pocket ones. But because cars are so big and heavy, it would still require a suitcase-sized Li-ion batteries to power about 12km of driving.What's more,the batteries are much expensive. ""A car filled with batteries could go a long distance,""says Ted Bohn, an electrical engineer in Chicago.""But it couldn't pull any people.and it would cost $100,000."" So researchers need to work out how to make batteries smaller and cheaper,among other questions. ""The answers don't exist yet,""Bohn says,""As a kid,I thought someone someplace knows the answer to everything.All of these questions haven't been decided.That's what engineering is about-making a guess,running tests and getting fine results."""

Gao Ling didn't let his mother take him to school because _ .	"Mr. Gao lives in a town. When he was twenty-five, his son was born. He calls him Gao Ling. The little boy is clever.

What is the possible reason why Wang Baoqiang wanted a divorce?	"A Chinese actor's divorce from his wife, over her alleged extramarital affair, has social media buzzing, with posts about the subject gaining over five billion views. Wang Baoqiang announced online on Sunday that he was divorcing his wife, Ma Rong, and sacking his agent, Song Zhe. He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. Ma has hit back at Wang, accusing him of abandoning their family. The topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce. It seems Wang's situation has struck a chord with many - which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards. The divorce quickly became a top trending topic in China. According to micro blog Sina Weibo, posts with the hashtag ""Wang BaoQiang Divorce"" have been viewed over five billion times. Chinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like ""Wang Don't Cry"" ""Wang We Support You"", quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 47% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. But why are they so interested? what is it about this one that's got all of China ruffled up? Some people feel that this divorce seems to fit a certain trope - of a beautiful but ordinary girl marrying a rich but less good-looking man. It is not uncommon to hear the belief that a couple has to ""match"" at every level - be it in status, or physical appearance - for a relationship to work out. Wang and Ma's split has many people wondering if uneven matches are unlikely to succeed. A lot of social media discussion has also centred around divorce, and in particular how people can protect themselves. Wang has alleged that his wife transferred and hid some of the couple's assets. They're a wealthy couple - their assets, according to Chinese media, include nine flats, a BMW car and various luxury goods. As a result, people are debating the importance of protecting individual assets, even after marriage."

What's the novel's author JK Rowling's attitude to the theme park?	"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park will open in Florida in 2009,and will provide attractions and rides based on places from the Harry Potter books. The novels' author JK Rowling has already given her blessing to the project. She said,""The plans I've seen look unbelievably exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed."" Stuart Craig, the man in charge of the design of the park, is an Oscar-winning production designer who worked on the Harry Potter films so it should be faithful to JK Rowling's vision. Stuart Craig said, ""Our primary goal is to make sure this experience is an authentic extension of Harry Potter's world as it is _ in the books and films."" Visitors to the park will be able to explore some of their favourite places from the book such as the village of Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest and, of course, Hogwarts Castle, where Harry goes to school. Although fans can look forward to a holiday in the Harry Potter theme park, many will be saddened by the fact that the best-selling series is now drawing to a close. The final instalment in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, will be published on 21 July, and to mark the event JK Rowling is to read extracts from the book to a select audience at midnight on the day of publication. Rowling has announced that two characters die in the final book, but has not revealed if Harry is one of them so fans will have to wait to find out the fate of their magical hero."

In their analysis, the researchers drew their conclusion by	Smoking bans in public places are linked with falls in childhood asthma attacks and preterm births , according to the biggest analysis of the influence of public smoking bans on child health. The finding should remove fears that such laws could have the opposite effect because they may lead people to smoke more at home. Several countries, such as Japan and Australia, have tightened laws on smoking in public places over the last few years. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of US states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer nations. Opponents often claim that bans could result in people smoking more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is one of the main concerns as second-hand smoke harms children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Centre reviewed as many as 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm births changed after smoking bans came in. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births, and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were carried out. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or cut down following a public ban, says Been. But Been also says the studies could not completely prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, as a matter of fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially as hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This might be one of the most important things to know in order to strengthen legislation . Other studies have shown that rates of heart attack and stroke also tend to fall after smoking bans are introduced.	['comparison']
". The best title for the passage would be"" _ ""."	Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. The beginnings of modem dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed. Her search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea. Her great contributions are in three areas. First, she began the expansion of the kinds of movements that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concerts. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity shown by complicated, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using all her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art. Her second contribution lies in dance costumes . She discarded corset, ballet shoes, and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing clothes, bare feet, and unlimited hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal. Her third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters, including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom. She was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance.	['A Pioneer in Modern Dance']
The room the author booked could only be _ .	"I decided a few months ago that l was going to treat myself to a 4-day getaway from Los Angeles and visit Chicago. I turned in some long-saved frequent flier miles for the airplane ticket, but had to shell out cash I really couldn't afford for the hotel. I found a travel website where a discounted promotional 3-night stay was purchased from a recently opened hotel. About three weeks before the trip, I had to regretfully cancel and only then realized the room, while transferable to another person, couldn't be changed to a later date and wasn't refundable .For the next two weeks, I tried selling it on Craig's list with no success. Five days before the ""big weekend"" I gave up trying to spend any money and decided I'd contact some friends who live in Chicago and offer someone a free ""staycation"". After trying a handful of people all of whom already had their own plans, I was determined to have the room not go to waste. That's when it suddenly occurred to me that I was looking at the rooms in the wrong way. Instead of viewing them for vacation purposes, surely there must be a way to put them to good use, and that was when the idea that some sort of shelter might be able to use it hit me. I finally found one whose focus is aiding victims of domestic violence. This particular one was willing to listen to my out-of-left-field story and facilitated the transfer of the rooms. The shelter was working with a desperate woman and her young daughter, who were fortunately able to make use of the room."	['transferred to another person']

"Why do parents like a ""back-to-school sale""?"	"There are many kinds of sales. For example, a ""back-to-school sale"" is held near the beginning of the school year. Parents like the lower prices of the clothes and school supplies for their children. A ""midnight madness"" event starts very late at night. An ""early bird special"" sale starts very early in the morning. This kind of sale is popular the day after Thanksgiving in November. A favorite sale among many people is the ""buy one, get one free"" sale. You buy one thing and get a second one without cost. When people see the word ""free"" in an advertisement they know they are getting a good deal. As a matter of fact, it is not the case. Another kind of sale is a ""going out of business"" sale. This is when a storeowner tries to sell all the goods in the store before closing the business permanently . Let us say the store sells floor coverings. The owner lowers the prices and puts up a sign that says: ""Going out of business sale. All items MUST be sold by tomorrow."" People who buy the floor coverings think they are getting a special deal because everything must be sold in a short period of time. Then, days later they see the store did not close permanently. And they see the same sign that claims the store is going out of business. Some business owners really do not end the business. They just want to earn more money. People also hold their own sales. They hold garage sales and yard sales outside their home. They sell things they no longer want. Groups such as religious centers or schools hold bake sales. They sell cakes, cookies and other baked goods to raise money. In America, you can always find a good sale, no matter the day or time of year. There is the Independence Day sale, Veteran's Day sale, clearance sale, sidewalk sale, red tag sale, white sale, blue light special, liquidation sale, half-off sale, warehouse sale, tent sale ..."

How many Chinese students are there at Valley Forge before this year?	"""Beating is a sign of affection, cursing is a sign of love."" Many may not expect to hear the words of the old Chinese saying in these modern Times-- with parents wealthier and better educated than they have ever been--but experts say they still ring true. Today,it seems,Chinese parents are more likely to send their children to precollege military academies in the United States in the hope that some tough love will pave the way to success. ""Good education doesn't mean letting your children enjoy privileges, especially our boys."" said Song Wenming,an entrepreneur in Jinhua,East China's Zhejiang province. ""They should be raised in tough conditions to know what to fight for in the future."" In August,Song sent his 17yearold son to Valley Forge Military Academy (VFMA) in Pennsylvania. _ . Statistics show that an increasing number of Chinese students have been registering with such academies. A few years ago, there were no Chinese students at Valley Forge. Today,there are 28.""All of the Chinese students at Valley Forge came from wealthy families;some of them were spoiled."" said Jennifer Myers, director of marketing and communications at the school. Song's only son, Song Siyu, had a rocky start during his first six weeks at the school. The teenager said he went to the school voluntarily but did not expect it to be as difficult. Now, three months later, he has perfected the art of taking a bath in 35 seconds, finishing a meal without looking at his food, and making his bed with precision. He can even take criticism,no matter how unreasonable. ""The training is hard but I know it is good for selfdevelopment of individuals."" said SongSiyu. ""The endless training and scolding are just ways to build up our character;they are not personal."" But his enthusiasm is not universal. Ten of the 13 Chinese students who joined the academy this year have transferred to other schools. But for those who stick to it, there is a reward for all the hard work."	['25.']
We can conclude from the passage that _	"Unless we spend money to spot(,) and prevent asteroids now, one might crash into Earth and destroy life as we know it, say some scientists. Asteroids are bigger versions of the meteoroids that race across the night sky. Most orbit the sun far from Earth and don't threaten us. But there are also thousands of asteroids whose orbits put them on a collision course with Earth. But $500 million worth of new telescopes right now, then spend $10 million a year for the next 25 years to locate most of the space rocks. By the time we spot a fatal one, the scientists say, we'll have a way to change its course. Is it worth it? Two things experts consider when judging any risk are (i) How likely the event is; (2) How bad the consequences if the event occurs. Experts think an asteroid big enough to destroy lots of life might strike Earth once every 500,000 years. Sounds pretty rare but if one did fall. It would be the end of the world. ""If we don't take care of these bid asteroids, they'll take care of us,"" says one scientist. ""it's that simple."" The cure, though, might be worse than the disease. Do we really want fleets(,) of nuclear weapons sitting around on Earth? ""the world has less fear from doomsday rocks than from a great nuclear fleet set against them."" Said a New York Times article."	['Workable solutions still have to be found to prevent a collision of asteroids with Earth.']
The main idea of the passage is _ .	"What is time? Is it a thing to be saved or spent or wasted, like money? Or is it something we have no control over, like the weather? Is time the same all over the world? That's an easy question, you say. Wherever you go, a minute is 60 seconds, an hour is 60 minutes, a day is 24 hours, and so forth. Well, maybe. But in America, time is more than that. Americans see time as a valuable resource. Maybe that's why they are fond of the expression, ""Time is money."" To Americans, punctuality is a way of showing respect for other people's time. Being more than 10 minutes late to an appointment usually calls for an apology, and maybe an explanation. People who are running late often call ahead to let others know of the delay. Of course, the less formal the situation, the less important it is to be exactly on time. At informal get-togethers, for example, people often arrive as much as 30 minutes past the appointed time. But they usually don't try that at work. American lifestyles show how much people respect the time of others. When people plan an event, they often set the time days or weeks in advance. Once the time is fixed, it takes almost an emergency to change it. If people want to come to your house for a friendly visit, they will usually call first to make sure it is suitable. Only very close friends will just ""drop by"" unannounced. Also, people hesitate to call others late at night for fear they might be in bed. The time may vary, but most folks think twice about calling after 10:00 p.m."	['the Americans attitude towards time.']
What do Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs have in common?	"With the passing of Steve Jobs, the tech industry has lost one of its most respected heroes. So where will the industry turn for inspiration, now that Jobs is gone? New Apple CEO, Tim Cook, will keep the business going, but he is unlikely to inspire the same kind of devotion as Jobs. Facebook owner, Mark Zuckerberg, has star power, but he and his company are still too young and untested. At Google, Larry Page is too awkward, and Eric Schmidt too clever, and a lot of the company's recent products are unfinished. But there's one tech leader who just might fill the gap: Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Bezos runs his business the same way as Steve Jobs ran his, with a focus on long-term value over short-term profits and a willingness to invest in seemingly unrelated new areas. Steve Jobs converted Apple from personal computers into music with the iPod, and then into cellphones with the iPhone. It worked, and made Apple into the biggest and richest tech company in the world. Jeff Bezos is doing the same thing at Amazon. In 2006, Amazon noticed it had a lot of spare capacity in its data centers. So it started renting out some of that capacity to some companies. Now, hundreds of newly-established Internet companies, including big names like Foursquare and Yelp, run their businesses on Amazon Web Services. Somehow, an outline bookseller became the most important provider of ""cloud computing"". In 2007, Amazon introduced its e-reader, the Kindle. The product developed slowly for a couple of years, and then started to take off in 2010 with the third generation. It sells for US$199, which is hundreds of dollars less than Apple's iPad, but it has similar functions to the iPad. No wonder Amazon has to build millions more than it expected to meet demand."

What is the passage mainly about?	"The poorer mental function seen among alcoholics,many of whom also regularly smoke cigarettes,may be partly due to the long term effects of nicotine ,new research suggests. ""People who are also smokers are at a much higher risk,"" Dr.Jennifer M.Glass of the University of Michigan's Addiction Research Center said. In her study,""Cigarette smoking has a bad effect on IQ and thinking,"" she said. This finding may seem counterintuitive ,since many smokers show that they feel quicker and focused after smoking. Indeed,research shows that improved mental functioning is one of the immediate effects of nicotine exposure. _ Studies show that up to 87 percent of alcoholics smoke cigarettes. Yet,few studies have looked into cigarette smoking as a factor that might explain the cognitive lack reported among alcoholics. To search for that association,Glass and her colleagues examined brain function among 172 men from the same area,including 103 men who abused alcohol. The team found that men with higher scores on the lifetime alcohol problems scale(LAPS)and those who reported a higher number of pack years of smoking both had lower IQ scores. Upon further research,the researchers found that smoking also appeared to be independently associated with weaker word and space reasoning. Thus,though smoking did not account for all of the decreased mental functioning observed among the alcohol abusers,it did seem to account for some of the effects,the report indicates."

The main idea of the passage is _ .	American scientists say musical training seems to improve communication skills. They found that developing musical skills involves the same process in the brain as learning how to speak. The scientists say that could help children with learning disabilities. Nina Kraus is a neurobiologist at Northwestern University in Illinois. She says musical training involves putting together different kinds of information. She says the process involves hearing music, looking at musical notes, touching an instrument and watching other musicians. She says the process is not much different from learning how to speak. Both involve different senses. Professor Krauss says musical training and learning to speak make us think about what we are doing. She says speech and music pass through a structure of the nervous system called the brain stem . The brain stem controls our ability to hear. Until recently, experts have thought the brain stem could not be developed or changed. But Professor Krauss and her team find that musical training can improve a person's brain stem activity. The study involved people with different levels of musical ability. They were asked to wear an electrical _ that measures brain activity. The people wore the device while they watched a video of someone speaking and a person playing a musical instrument. The study found that the more years of training people had, the more sensitive they were to the sound and beat of the music. Professor Kraus says the study shows the importance of musical training to children with learning disabilities.	['that musical training is important for communication skills']
What is a good study habit?	Do you know how to study better? Let me give you some advice about studying. First, don't put off studying. Many students do that. Then they have to cram the night before the exam. In fact you need good study habits and study a little every day. This way, you will prepare better for the exams. Second, plan _ into your study time. For example, if you read 20 pages of the book, you can play one computer game. But only one. Third, stay in a quiet place and turn off your mobile phone. Then you can put your heart into your study. Last, believe it or not, sleeping is part of studying. It can help you learn better. Try to sleep more than eight hours a night. Take the advice, and you will study better.	['Not putting off studying.']
The writer started to change his thinking _ .	"I used to hate my mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with me. Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life. About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there. On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called ""Chocolate or Toys"". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice. This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining . A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict and how much she hated her mother. ""I want a new mom,"" she cried. ""Unluckily, you can't have one,"" the leader replied. ""You have to accept the mother that you have."" This hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation."	"['after the exercise named ""Chocolate or Toys""']"
Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?	"One morning last summer Joyce Andrews made some sausage sandwiches for her husband's lunch. There was one sausage left over. Mrs. Andrews didn't care for them herself, and so she gave the last one to Henry, their little dog, Henry ate it up quickly. During the morning the dog got ill. He wouldn't stop shaking his head, and couldn't stand properly. Joyce thought, ""He's eaten something that didn't agree with him. Maybe that sausage very bad..."" she suddenly remembered her husband's lunch. She ran to the telephone and called Jim at office. ""Jim, I hope you haven't eaten any of those sandwiches yet."" ""You have Two? Well, listen--don't eat any more. I gave Henry the last sausage, and new he's ill. Go to the doctor, Jim."" ""What? You feel all right? No, Jim, don't take a chance with your health. I'm sure the sausages are bad. Please go..."" ""Yes, Jim. Tell him about the dog. Get some medicine."" Jim came back at lunch time and went to bed. ""I had a very unpleasant hour at the doctor"" he told Joyce, ""and the medicine made me very sick."" The next morning Jim was fine. Henry seemed quite fit again, too. At eleven o'clock milkman came with the milk. ""Morning, Mrs. Andrews,"" the milkman said ""How's your dog this morning? I've been thinking about him..."" ""Have you? Well, he seems all right now, but..."" ""Yesterday morning he and I had I a little accident. He jumped up at me, and I dropped a bottle of milk on his head."""

The author will most probably agree that composers _ .	"Most people want to know how things are made. They honestly admit, however, that they hardly know a thing when it comes to understanding how a piece of music is made. Where a composer begins, how he manages to keep going - in fact, how and when he learns his trade - all are covered in complete darkness. The composer, in short, is a man of mystery . One of the first things the common man wants to know about is the part inspiration plays in a composer's work. He finds it difficult to believe that composers are not much interested in that question. Writing music is as natural for the composer as eating or sleeping for all. Music is something that the composer happens to have been born for. The composer, therefore, does not say to himself: ""Do I feel inspired?"" He says to himself: ""Do I feel like working today?"" And if he feels like working, he does. It is more or less like saying to himself: ""Do I feel sleepy?"" If you feel sleepy, you go to sleep. If you don't feel sleepy, you stay up. If the composer doesn't feel like working, he doesn't work. It's as simple as that."	['are born with a gift for music']
What color might help lose weight according to the text?	"Why is pink or purple a color for girls and blue or brown for boys? The answer depends largely on cultural values as well as personal experiences. To the Egyptians, green was a color that represented the hope and joy of spring, while for Muslims, it means heaven. Red is a symbol of good luck in many cultures. In China, children are given money in a red envelope to bring good fortune in the New Year. For many nations, blue is a symbol of protection and religious beliefs. Greek people often wear a blue necklace hoping to protect themselves against evils . People's choice of colors is also influenced by their bodies' reactions toward them. Green is said to be the most restful color. It has the ability to reduce pain and relax people both mentally and physically. People who work in green environment have been found to have fewer stomach aches. Red can cause a person's blood pressure to rise and increase people's appetites . Many decorators will include different shades of red in the restaurant. Similarly, many commercial websites will have a red ""Buy Now"" button because red is a color that easily catches a person's eye. Blue is another calming color. Unlike red, blue can cause people to lose appetite. So if you want to eat less, some suggest that eating from blue plates can help. The next time you are deciding on what to wear or what color to decorate your room, think about the color carefully."	['Blue.']
Who is the farmer?	Four friends live in a small town. Their names are Cook, Miller, Smith, and Carter. They have different jobs. One is a policeman, one is a carpenter , one is a farmer, and one is a doctor. One day Cook's son broke his right leg, and Cook took him to the doctor. The doctor's sister is Smith's wife. The farmer isn't married . He has a lot of good hens. Miller always buys eggs from the farmer. The policeman sees Smith every day because they are neighbors .	['Carter']
According to the passage, Jeremy Lin's excellent performance saved the following except _	With his game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer, Jeremy Lin finished the New York Knicks' dramatic reversed victory to defeat the Toronto Rapters. The Knicks have won six games in a row, and Jeremy Lin has put up impressive numbers during the continuous period of competitions. Although the season is still _ , the Knicks have reversed course in just one week from the NBA's most disappointing team to a playoff contestant. Lin, not team's high-paid stars, has saved the Knicks season and likely coach D'Antoni's job. After nearly 15 years of disappointing, sometimes unsuccessful seasons, Madison Square Garden is alive again, and New York City can't stop talking about the Knicks. To put things into perspective , consider this: Just several years back, Knicks fans protested nightly outside of the Garden calling for the team's ownership to fire their resented coach Isiah Thomas. Now, Madison Square Garden Co. shares are at a record high, the Knicks' average household television rating is up 70 percent since Lin joined the starting lineup , and jersey sales are increasing very quickly. I watched the Knicks-Lakers game at a bar in Harlem, and have not felt that kind of energy from fans since the great playoff between the Knicks and Miami Heat in the late 1990s. Beyond the Knicks, Lin may be saving the NBA as well. Just a few months back, the NBA took a massive credibility hit during a multi-month lockout , where the owners did not allow the players to go back to play until they accept the new salary levels. As a consequence, the season did not even begin until Christmas Day. Over the past few years, LeBron James' (.) relatively long and unpleasant free-agent events, combined with poor play around the league, have angered fans and damaged the league's brand. Lin is leading a one-week NBA basketball revival. His legendary story has inspired Asian-Americans, increased NBA sales in China, and turned the basketball world upside down.	['Coach Isiah Thomas']
In the pessimistic view, people will _ in a hundred years 'time.	"Some people are pessimistic when they think about the future. They say that, a hundred years from now, we will have used up most of the earths resources. We will have made our seas so dirty that we will not be able to eat fish from them. There will be so many people in the world that we will have to use all the countryside for housing; there will be no farmland left. Other people have a different idea about the future. In their view, the city of the future will be a huge pyramid-shaped building, which will be floating on the surface of the sea. About 5,000 families will live there, and there will also be schools, shops in it. In a hundred years' time, people will not need to use oil. They will heat their homes with power from the sun. Think of space. Perhaps a station will be set up on the moon; people will be able to visit the moon as tourists. They may even spend their holidays in space, travelling from planet to planet. What an interesting picture! Many people don't think about the future. ""I don't care. I'll be dead. ""they say. But it is our duty to care because the world of a hundred years' time will be the world of our children's and their children after them."	['find it difficult to live on the earth']
When teenagers have something difficult to say, they usually _ .	Many teenagers feel that the most important people in their lives are their friends. They believe that their family members don't know them as well as their friends do. In large families, it is quite often for brothers and sisters to fight with each other and then they will go to their friends for some ideas. It is very important for teenagers to have one good friend or a group of friends. Even when they are not with their friends, they usually spend a lot of time talking to them on the phone. This communication is very important in children's growing up, because friends can discuss special things. These things are difficult to say to their family members. However, parents often try to choose friends for their children. Some parents may even stop their children from meeting their friends. Have you ever thought of the following questions? Who choose your friends? Do you choose your friends or your friends choose you? Have you got a good friend your parents don't like? Your answers are welcome?	['discuss it with their friends']
Which of the following is NOT true?	Penguins live together, but each pair has a little piece of ground of their own. When a penguin wants to walk through its neighbor's ground, it must ask for permission . If it does not, it will have to fight. Penguins come and go all day. They fight for fish and look after their children. All penguins are good parents--the male penguins are perhaps the best parents in the world. They choose their wives in the dark They can only hear them--not see them. Then the female penguins lay their eggs and go away for about two months. The males look after the eggs. If the eggs get cold, there will be no chicks. There is no food. The snow falls and the wind blows--sometimes at 150 kilometers an hour. The penguins do not move. When the females return from the sea, they will not remember their husbands. It doesn't matter. Only one thing-- their eggs. Male penguins never fight--unless a penguin leaves a chick for a minute. Then they fight because they all want it. They are strange and wonderful birds.	['Female penguins take care of the eggs.']
If a child plays with his invisible friend, it shows that _ .	Children, especially at young ages, are very creative. And creativity can be a glorious thing. Look at all the amazing artists and architects that have created glorious pieces of history. Look at all the authors with the award winning books. Now I am not saying everyone is going to end up this way but creativity is an important part of growing up and becoming who you are. This should be encouraged in young children as well as the older children. Young children grow up playing with make-believe. And so many people try to make their young child see that their invisible friend isn't real or that talking when someone is not in the room is _ . To adults it is, but for small children it is them being creative. May it be them playing house, or chef, or playing with stuffed animals, it is their creative part coming out. Some kids can have fun playing with rocks and sticks and it's because of their creativeness that they can do this. The invisible friend part is another part of being imaginative, and is not a bad thing since they will grow out of that phase. So encourage this and play along with them, play house or stuffed animals or whatever they want to play. Help keep their imagination running. You can even make up games, like treasure hunts, dinosaurs, or super heroes; there is just so much you can choose from. For older children, talk to them. Help them see things through others' eyes, or help them see things from a different point of view. Helping children see things from other views helps them keep their minds open for new ideas and new things. All this can help your children's minds stay creative. The arts and music, even thoughts are an important part of life and important in our society. If we didn't have and encourage creative thinking, we wouldn't have had inventors, or philosophers, or as I said before, artists.	['the child has great imagination']

At the end of the passage, Mr. Bennet sounded _ toward his wife's proposal.	"It is a truth universally acknowledged that . However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of someone or other of their daughters. ""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day. ""have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. ""But it is, "" returned she, ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."" Mr. Bennet made no answer. ""Do you not want to know who has taken it?"" cried his wife impatiently. ""You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."" This was invitation enough. ""Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."" ""What is his name?"" ""Bingley."" ""Is he married or single?"" ""Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"" How so? How can it affect them? ""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."" ""Is that his design in settling here?"" ""Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."" ""I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as beautiful as any of them. Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.

It can be concluded that_.	Memo to: Parents Memo from: Administration Office, St. Augustine's Elementary School Topic: Lunch Program and School Information Date: Tuesday, November 23, 2010 We would like to thank all parents and guardians for your cooperation as we carry out a new method of delivering our lunch program. So far the month-long test of the new system has gone smoothly. For your convenience, we have included a copy of the envelope below to allow you to record the days you have ordered lunch for your child. You can keep this copy at home for your reference. Please note, lunches are prepared using the School Food Guidelines both in terms of items served and size. During the first two weeks some people wrote in additions to the menu, such as ordering extra items. Due to the logistics involved and our limited volunteer base we are unable to fulfill these requests. Ordering process: This year we will distribute a two week lunch envelope. If you decide to order the meal offered on a given day, simply check the box in front of that meal choice. For example, if you choose seven meals over the two weeks, then please enclose (7 x $2.00) fourteen dollars ($14.00) in the envelope. Seal it, and return it to your child's teacher. Please note that the cost for the lunch remains the same: $2.00 daily and includes fruit and milk. You will note that we have also reduced daily choices. For example on Fridays, we offered chicken burgers and hamburgers. This has been changed to chicken burgers on one week and hamburgers the following week. Food prepared according to special requests has also been changed. These items will now be prepared with the same ingredients. If your child does not like the lunch being served on a particular day please ensure that he/she has a packed lunch from home. Thank you for your attention on this matter and we look forward to working with you once again this year. Please return the attached envelopes by Thursday, December 2, 2011.

According to Doug,what is the wage of an employee?	Technology is making life easier for some dairy farmers.They use robotic systems to milk their cows.Cows are trained to follow a series of paths that lead to milking stations.Only one cow at a time can enter a station. Once inside,the cow is rewarded with food.As the cow eats,a robotic arm cleans and connects the animal to the milking machine.A few minutes later,milking is complete.The gate is opened,the cow is released and the next cow enters. The robotic systems are designed to operate 24 hours a day.The cows get to decide when they want to be milked.Cows are milked an average of about three times a day.Some are milked four to six times a day. The cows wear collars around their necks that identify them to the system.A computer keeps records on their eating and milking.A cow is released from the station if the computer decides it should not be milked. The automated system also measures the temperature and color of freshly produced milk.Milk is thrown away if it does not pass the tests. Professor Plaut believes the systems will appeal especially to the next generation of farmers.She means young people who are more interested in technology and less interested in working all the time on the farm.Still,she says the price of robotic milking systems will continue to limit their use. Doug and Tina Suhr have more than 100 cows on their family farm.Last year it became the fourth farm in southeast Minnesota to get a robotic milking system.A recent story in a local agricultural newspaper said the first robot cost 175 000 dollars.The second cost 150 000. Doug told AgriNews that wages that would have been paid for one employee in five years will pay for one robot.He says the increase in milk production reaches a high of more than six kilograms per cow per day.

For those who do not take breakfast, the good news is that _ .	"Generations of Americans have been brought up to believe that a good breakfast is essential to one's life. Eating breakfast at the start of the day, we have been told, and told again, is as necessary as putting gasoline in the family car before starting a trip. But for many people, the thought of food as the first thing in the morning is never a pleasure. So in spite of all the efforts, they still take no breakfast. Between 1977 and 1983, the latest year for which figures could be obtained, the number of people who didn't have breakfast increased by 33%--from 8.8 million to 11.7 million--according to the Chicago-based Market Research Corporation of America. For those who dislike eating breakfast, however, there is some good news. Several studies in the last few years have shown that, for grown-ups especially, there may be nothing wrong with omitting breakfast. ""Going without breakfast does not affect work,"" said Arnold E. Bender, former professor of nutrition at Queen Elizabeth College in London, ""nor does giving people breakfast improve work."" Scientific evidence linking breakfast to better health or better work is surprisingly inadequate, and most of the recent work involves children, not grown-ups. ""The literature,"" says one researcher, Dr Earnest Polite at the University of Texas, ""is poor."""	"[""the omission of breakfast has little effect on one's work""]"

What can be the best title of the passage?	"Have you lost your marbles ? Don't worry! You can buy more from Harli Jordean. Harli Jordean, the 8-year-old kid, soon to be 9, is just too lovely. He was born in Stoke Newington, London in spring 2003. He started up an Internet marble company where he sells the toys. And recently the 8-year-old student was written into the record books for being the youngest founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of an Internet company. Harli's love for marbles got rolling when he was 6. According to Tina, Harli's mother, he loved the colcorful toys so much that he would go to sleep talking about marbles and the first thing in the morning he did was talking about marbles. And his family started calling him ""the Marble King"". ""I like the patterns and designs of marbles. You can collect hundreds of different color1s, shaps, and sizes. It's fun,"" Harli told WR News. ""And I really enjoy looking at them, touching them, holding them, studying them and playing them with my friends."" Harli Jordean's marble company has a long history. After losing his marbles to an older boy, Harli and his mom turned to the Internet for ordering more marbles. However, they couldn't find a Web site that sold the toys. That gave Harli an idea-to start a Web site where people could find different types of marbles. With his family's help, Harli created a Web site that sells marbles and marble accessories. His collection includes tiny and large marbles, along with clear and color1ful ones. Since starting his business, Harli has learned how to work with marble suppliers and fill orders. In the past two years, he's received orders from customers around the world. Some of the countries where he has sold the most marbles are Brazil, Italy, and the United States. Most kids just love marbls! So how does Harli feel about being the world's youngest CEO? ""It feels marvelous . I like having my own company. I like being the boss,"" he says. ""It really ...surprised me and probably ... my teachers too. I don't think they believed me when I used to say to them 'I have a marble business'!"""	['A kid became the youngest founder and CEO.']
The text mainly tells us that _ .	"Tom Sawyer is known as one of the most beloved characters in American literature , but new research found that Mark Twain based this character on his friend named Tom Sawyer. He admired his firefighting friend so much that he gave the character his name. Mark Twain and Tom Sawyer had many adventures together, gambling in Nevada and drinking in pubs. Tom Sawyer once worked as a volunteer firefighter, policeman and customs officer. Before making his way out West, Tom Sawyer used his strength to save 90 people from a burning ship. Mark Twain was particularly moved by this story because his own brother died in a fire while working on a similar steamboat. The two men became friends immediately after meeting in 1863, with Tom Sawyer traveling to Virginia City, while Mark Twain was working as a reporter there. After one night they returned to San Francisco, Mark Twain told his friend that he would base a character in his yet-unwritten book on him. Tom Sawyer said, ""One day he said to me, 'I'm going to put you between the covers of a book, Tom.' 'Go ahead, Sam,' I Said, 'but don't disgrace my name.'"" Besides their fondness of drinking, the two men also shared a hobby for storytelling. Tom sawyer believed that it was his anecdotes about his own childhood that inspired Mark Twain to create a book on him. Finally Mark Twain said that the character of Tom sawyer was based on a mix of three real people---John B. Briggs, William Bowen and himself. In spite of this, the historical evidence shows that there might be a fourth, more prominent influencer."	"[""Mark Twain based Tom Sawyer on his friend's name""]"
In which order will the Presidential1 coins come out?	"Hundreds of people lined up at Grand Central Terminal yesterday, but they weren't there to catch a train. They came to New York City's famous railroad station to trade in old dollar bills for the new George Washington Presidential1 coin. The gold-colored coin is the first in a new series by the U.S. Mint that honors former U.S. Presidents. The Mint will issue four Presidential1 coins a year through 2016. Like the popular 50 State Quarters program, which issues coins in the order in which each state joined the Union, Presidential1 coins will come out in the order in which each President served. The George Washington coin is the first to be released. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison coins will come out later this year. The Presidential 1 coins will be the same size and color as the Sacagawea Golden Dollar. However, there is an important difference. For the first time since the 1930s, there is an inscription on the edge of each coin. Each coin will show a different President on its face, or head side. It will also show the President's name, the order in which he served and his years in office. The other side of the coin will show the Statue of Liberty and the inscriptions ""United States of America"" and "" 1"". There will be one Presidential1 coin for each President, except Grover Cleveland. He will have two! Cleveland is the only U.S. President to have served two nonconsecutive terms. The last President scheduled to get a coin is Gerald Ford because a President must have been dead for two years before he can be on a coin."	['Each President took office.']
Which of the following is NOT mentioned about South Korean TV series in the passage?	Last year more than 13 Korean TV series were introduced in China. Turn on the TV, and Korean beauties are appearing during peak viewing times . Some of the dramas are being _ , but audiences continue to watch them. Why are the South Korean TV series loved by so many Chinese people? Cheng Yiting, a student from East China Normal University, gives us her reasons. She thinks that the good-looking actors with cool clothes and the beautiful sight in the dramas are the selling points for South Korean TV dramas. But what attracted the young audiences most is the pure and moving love stories. And it seems that South Korean TV series has also won the hearts of middle-aged people. They are touched by the morals in the shows. These include the importance of respecting elders and social order. Though some people think South Korean TV series are too slow and too long, most of the Chinese audiences like them. Maybe we are really tired of Western TV series. Compared with that, South Korean TV series are not bad.	['The youth self-respect']
What is the tone of the article?	"On the eve of our daughters' weddings, I gave both of them what I considered to be excellent marital advice: never leave your husband unsupervised with pruning shears . _ I recently let my guard down. Thirty-some years of marriage can do that to a woman. Give a man pruning shears and electric trimmers and he will give new meaning to ""armed and dangerous."" One day earlier this year, my husband said that the crab apple tree was dead. ""Why do you think it is dead?"" I asked. ""Look at it. There's not a leaf on it."" ""There's not a leaf on anything. It's March,"" I said. ""It looked sick last fall and with this bitter winter we had, I'm convinced it's dead."" The truth is he's never liked the crab apple. Sure, it has beautiful blooms in the spring, but then it gets a disease, the leaves curl, and it drops those little apples that sit on the driveway. Each passing week he pronounced the tree dead. Eventually I began to believe him. Though he agreed it would be a regrettable loss, there was a twinkle in his eye. He armed himself a couple of weeks ago and began trimming. A branch here, a branch there, a small limb, then a large limb. I watched and then decided to check the wood on some of the branches closer to the trunk. I broke one off and saw green.

What can we conclude from the passage?	EVERY few hundred years, a sleeping giant in southern Italy awakens with a bang, spewing volcanic ash across the countryside. The volcano, called Mount Vesuvius, formed 25,000 years ago. During its most explosive eruptions, the volcano could blanket nearby cities with hot ash, sometimes also burying them with deadly flows of mud and rocks. One famous eruption occurred nearly 2,000 years ago, in the year AD 79. It lasted 18 hours and destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, killing thousands of people as they tried to escape. Scientists and city officials had supposed that Naples, one of Italy's most populous cities, was far enough away that it would be safe from the volcano's _ . New evidence suggests that this might not be the case. Researchers recently discovered 4000-year-old layers of ash and mud under present-day Naples. Just outside the city, they also uncovered abandoned villages, as well as human and animal skeletons. Most surprising of all, the researchers say, was the discovery of thousands of footprints from the same time period, pressed into layers of wet ash that had rained from the sky. The footprints show that thousands of people were fleeing to the northwest, away from the volcano, as it erupted. Mount Vesuvius hasn't had a major eruption since 1631, but it's still very active. The discovery of the ancient ash layers, skeletons, and footprints is a warning that modern Naples, a city of 3 million people, isn't safe from the volcano, scientists say. So, when the volcano begins to rumble again, Naples should have an emergency evacuation plan ready - just in case.	['Mount Vesuvius is a potential danger to Naples.']

Scientists believe that_.	"You either have it , or you don't -a sense of direction ,that is .But why is it that some people could find their way across the Sahara without a map ,while others can lose themselves in the next street? Scientists say we're all born with a sense of direction ,but it is not property understood how it works .One theory is that people with a good sense of direction have simply worked harder at developing it. Research being carried out atprefix = st1 /LiverpoolUniversitysupports this idea and suggests that if we don't use it. we lose it . ""Children as young as seven have the ability to find their way around."" says Jim Martland .Research Director of the project . ""However if they are not allowed out alone or are taken everywhere by car ,they never develop the skills"" Jim Martland also emphasizes that young people should be taught certain skills to improve their sense of direction .He makes the following suggestions. *If you are using a map ,turn it so it relates to the way you are facing. *If you leave your bike in a strange place ,put it near something like a big stone or a tree. Note landmarks on the route as you go away from your bike .When you return ,go back along the same route *Simplify the way of finding your direction by using lines such as streets in a town,streams ,or walls in the countryside to guide you .Count your steps so that you know how far you have gone and note any landmarks such as tower blocks or hills which can help to find out where you are. Now you need never get lost again!"	['everybody posses a sense of direction from birth']
According to the second letter, some college students _ .	Dear Victor, I am a college student. Nowadays games on the net are very popular with college students. Some of my roommates are very interested in them. They not only play games in their free time, but also keep talking about them at night when lights are off, and they regard games as a part of their life. I've asked them to give it up, but they wouldn't listen to me. It has become a rather big problem. Should I report it to our teachers or do something else? Ted Dear Ted, Drop it. Your roommates, as grown--ups, can do whatever they want with their time so long as it doesn't break school rules or violate other people's interests. Playing perhaps gives these students relaxation from hard study. If they play too often and have little time to study, they will reap what they have sown , but you will not. Reporting to the teachers would only harm your good name in your dormitory . However, you have rights to ask your roommates to be quiet when you need sleep. If they aren't angry with you, they will stop talking. But be polite and friendly. Perhaps, in return, join them in a game or two. Victor	['can relax themselves while playing games on the net']

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	Milk is the most complete food in the world. It has many things that we need to help us grow. It can give us energy and good health. Milk is a food enjoyed by people of all ages as we can easily _ it. Milk is produced by all mother animals to feed their babies after they are born. Some such as cows produce more milk than their young ones need, so the extra milk is used by people. Nowadays, baby cows are often taught to eat solid food earlier, so that we can use most of the cow's milk. A cow can produce as much as 45 liters of milk a day. She will give good milk if she is fed on rich grass. Many products can be made from cow's milk. The simplest is cream, which is made from the fat of the milk. Butter is made from cream. Cream is also used for making cakes and other foods. Another common milk product is cheese. Cow's milk can be also turned into powdered milk. In countries where cows are not raised, people get milk from other animals. The buffalo gives milk to the people of India. In China, Iran and Turkey, a large number of sheep and goats are kept for their milk. And many Arabs drink camel's milk. For babies, however, the best of all is their mother's milk which is given to them during their first few months of life.	['People can use as much as 45 liters of milk a day.']

What do we learn about Mark Twain from the passage?	In addition to writing articles and books, Mark Twain delighted the audience with his public lectures about the faraway places he visited on his travels. People were eager to learn about his trips to places like the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Egypt and the Holy Land. Twain often used the fees he earned from his lectures to pay for more adventures. His well-attended performances also served to bring attention to his published work. At that time, the public lecture was a very popular form of entertainment, and audiences' expectations ran high, but Twain never failed to amuse them. Twan also wrote on amusing subjects. In 1873, he released a book called The Gilded Age. The book was a satire of the very wealthy of the time. A satire is a work that makes fun of bad human behavior, such as wasteful spending. Twain made people laugh at the excesses of the rich. In 1889, Twain took on other members of the Establishment. He wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, about a boy who travels back to the time of King Arthur. Twain made fun of those who were given advantages not because they had earned them but because of their family connections. If you have never read any of Mark Twain's works, try reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, or The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. They will make you laugh.	['His lectures were very popular.']
From the passage we can see that _ .	"How many men do housework? Recently a European commission tried to find out people's ideas and reactions to the women's movement. As part of their survey , they asked many men and women the question, ""Who does the housework?"" The men answered very differently from the women! The housework they asked people about was: preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning the house and babysitting. 48% of British husbands said they did these things. 37% of Danish men helped in the house. But only 15% of Italian men said they did the housework; many of them said they never helped at all! But there was an interesting point of view from the wives. According to British wives, only 38% of their husbands helped in the house. And Italian wives said that their husbands hardly ever helped. The Italian and British men did not tell the truth! The Commission found that Danish men were the most truthful husbands; their answers were the same as their wives' answers. Do the men you know help in the house? Do you think the survey gives a true picture in your experience? Write and tell us what you think."	['there are more wives who do the housework than husbands']
Why did the Japanese stop his work?	This is a true story that happened in Japan.In order to _ the house, a Japanese tore open the walls. Japanese houses normally have a hollow space between the wooden walls. When tearing down the walls, he found that there was a lizard stuck there because a nail from outside was hammered into one of its feet. He saw this, feeling pity and curious.When he checked the nail, he found ti was nailed 10 years ago when the house was first built. What happened? The lizard had survived in such a position for 10 years! It has been in a dark wall partition for 10 years without moving! Then he wondered how this lizard survived for 10 years without moving a single step......since its foot was nailed! So he stopped his work and observed the lizard: what has it been doing?what and how has it been eating? Later, he didn't know from where another lizard appeared, with food in its mouch.Ah! He was astonished and touched deeply. The free lizard had been feeding the stuck one for the past 10 years...... Such love, a beautiful love! Such love happened with this tiny creature... What can love do? It can do wonders! Just think about it: one lizard had been feeding the other one untiringly for 10 long years, without giving up hope on its partner. If a small creature like a lizard can love like this... just imagine how we can love if we try.	['To find out why the lizard had survived here for 10 years.']

""When she drinks your medicine, she must grow to the right size and have hair and teeth,"" the king said, ""If you don't do this, you'll have a beating."" The doctors thought it impossible, but they dared not say anything against the king's order. Just then and old doctor stepped forward. ""Oh, we shall certainly obey your order,"" he said, ""but it takes time. We have to dig a mineral from the Kun Lun Mountains when the snow melts for the second time. The snow melts on those mountains only once in six years. So we need twelve years."" At last the king agreed and the doctors took away the little princess. On her twelfth birthday, they brought her back to her parents with long black hair and beautiful teeth. The king and queen were very happy and gave the doctors expensive presents."

What information is NOT found in the text?	"Many people think prefix = st1 /Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made. It was filmed in 1942, during the Second World War, and starred Humphrey Bogart as Rick, and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. The movie is set in Casablanca, a place the Germans hope to take from the French.

While making friends, kids think more about the following EXCEPT _ .	"Washington: A research conducted at the University of Maryland looks at the numerous complex reasons as to why young children decide to include or exclude other kids from their group of friends. It suggests that the kids' decision-making process is much more complex than previously believed. ""They take into account group information, ranging from cliques and networks, when deciding what makes a group work well. Sometimes kids are excluded because they lack social skills, but a lot of time it has nothing to do with that. Instead it has to do with what we refer to as 'group membership' such as gender, race, nation, and culture,"" says Professor Melanie Killen, the Associate Director of the Centre for Children Relationships and Culture at Maryland, who led the 4-year project. Reporting their findings in the journal, the researcher said whatever was the reason, individuals who experienced long-term exclusion from the group of friends suffered from depression, anxiety and loneliness. The study looked at two models to define how children make decisions regarding acceptance of other kids in their group -- the individual social _ model and the inter-group social cognition model. While the former says that children's rejection occurs due to social deficits like shyness, wariness or fearfulness, the latter says that it happens because of group dynamics, prejudice and exclusion. It was also found that the age of children was also a factor that influenced their decisions regarding other kids' acceptance as friends. ""With age, kids become more aware of group dynamics, conventions, customs, and rituals. With this comes a greater concern about group functioning, which can lead to exclusion which can be negative from a social justice viewpoint,"" says Killen. The researcher believes that her study may have many benefits, as it could provide insights into how to help when children are rejected by their peers."	['social skills']
The main purpose of the text is to _ .	When parents talk about school safety these days, they're usually referring to the increase in violence at schools.

The government has not decided whether special lanes should be drawn _ .	In a great many cities, hundreds of people ride bicycles to work every day. In New York City, some bike riders have even formed a group called Bike for a Better City. They declare that if more people rode bicycles to work, there would be fewer automobiles in the downtown part of the city and so less dirty air from car engines. For several years this group has been trying to get the city government to help bicycle riders. For example. They want the city to draw special lanes for bicycles only on some of the main streets, because when bicycle riders must use the same lanes as cars, there are accidents. Bike for a Better City feels that if there were special lanes, more people would use bikes. But no bicycle lanes have been drawn. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea-they say it will slow the traffic. Some store owners on the main streets don't like the idea-they say that if there is less traffic, they will have less business. The city government has not yet decided what to do. It wants to keep everyone happy. On weekends, Central Park-the largest place of open ground in New York-is closed to cars, and the roads may be used by bicycles only. But Bike for a Better City says that this is not enough and keeps fighting to get bicycle lanes downtown.	['because there are different opinions']

His career retrospective , ""Eli Reed: A Long Walk Home"", is an extraordinary search of beauty while recording hardship. With a heart of love, Reed uses a style that uncovers humanity at every turn. According to Reed, ""A Long Walk Home"" is about what it means to be a human being. It all began with a photo he took of his mother and his memory of her smile. Raised in New Jersey, reed was originally a painter. Primarily self-taught in photography, he became a freelance photographer in 1970. after producing some impressive photos that drew much attention, he joined the famous company Magnum Photos---the first black photographer invited to do so.

An old man wrapped in a sheet plays a drum in front of a sign reading ""God Is the Way"" while National Guardsmen lift their guns during a war in Miami. A young boy upside down with his legs in the air in a Kenyan refugee camp, his determined look faces the camera. In Harlem, New York, a group of laughing children take over an abandoned car, using it as a jungle gym. Where another photographer might have focused on the _ of these situations. Reed's camera smiles. His images show how humans cope, rise above, and carry on. This is what gives "" A Long Walk Home"" its power. Considering the places Reed has been to, there are very few photos of guns or obvious violence. Instead, Reed focuses on the varied human responses to hardship. We smile along with Reed in a gesture of compassion and solidarity. We recognize our fellow human beings."	['only had white employees originally']

Yet he could not turn out the fearful whimpers of his little dog, or the uncomfortable sounds of his mother anxious in her room next door, unable to sleep through the storm despite her insistence they would be all right.

Soon water was seeping into the single floor house. Quickly it rose from ankle level to leg level. At Donald's insistence, they pushed their way through the water --- now chest high --- toward the front door. When they fought their way into the living room, water rose to their chins.

The purpose of mentioning his father's unexpected death is to _ .	"If you could leave a farewell video for your loved ones that they'd see only if you died, would you do it? I think I would. I read about an app that helps people create a video to be published on a social-networking site only after death. Of course you don't need an app since it's easy to make your own video with smartphones, laptops and computers. But how many people do you know who would actually go ahead and leave ""If I die"" footage ? My father died unexpectedly on Christmas Eve three years ago and I've since longed for one more time to talk to him and hear his voice. Imagine if he had left such a video. I would see him again, hear his laughter and benefit from his parting words and advice. I don't think people, unless they have a terminal illness, go through life thinking they'd better leave a video in case of an _ death. But it is an opportunity to say all the things you want to say before it's too late. Still, some say that such a video robs loved ones of their own memories of you. Any special images they have would be superimposed by the video image you've created. Others think it's scaring and might be tempting fate. I expect my video would consist of reminders to my children: Be safe; be[:++Z+X+X+K]mindful of your surroundings; exercise good judgment; speak up; it never hurts to ask; don't waste time and ""call when you get there"". And in addition, I would repeat what I always tell them: I need to know where you are, every-step-of-the-way. That would make them laugh. Readers, would you find comfort in knowing you've said your farewells and left something concrete for your loved ones? What messages would you leave for family and friends?"

People can't hear crow talk _ .	A crow is about twenty inches long and black all over. Crows are dirty birds because they live on bad food. Crows eat a lot of waste food. In this way they are more useful to us than any birds. They clean up the dirty things in our streets. Crows are always hungry. They look for food all day, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests in the trees. They sleep there at night. Crows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns like human beings . It is easy to tell from crow's sound if they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds. A pair of crows will live together all their lives, and if one of them dies, the other one becomes very sad and quiet for the rest of its life and some time later it dies too.	['quietly']
In the study, the volunteers were taught _ .	"Scientists have proved that sleeping and learning go hand in hand. Even a short nap can boost our memory and sharpen our thinking. But the relationship goes deeper than that. ""The brain is not passive while you sleep,"" scientist Anat Arzi said. ""It's quite active. You can do many things while you are asleep."" Arzi and her coworkers didn't try to teach the sleeping volunteers any complex information, like new words or facts. Instead, the scientists taught volunteers to make new connections between smells and sounds. When we smell something good, like a flower, we take deep breaths. When we smell something bad, we take short breaths. Arzi and her co-workers based their experiment on these reactions. Once the volunteers fell asleep in the lab, the scientists went to work. They gave them a whiff of something pleasant and meanwhile played a particular musical note. They didn't wake up, but they heard--and sniffed deeply. Then the scientists gave the volunteers a whiff of something terrible and played a different musical note. Again, the volunteers heard and smelled--a short snort this time--but didn't wake up. The researchers repeated the experiment. After just four repetitions, volunteers made a connection between the musical notes and their paired smells. When the scientists played the musical tone that went with good smells, the sleepers breathed deeply. And when the scientists played the musical tone that went with bad smells, the sleepers breathed briefly--despite there being no bad smell. The next day, the volunteers woke up with the sound-smell connection. They breathed deeply when hearing one tone and cut their breaths short when hearing the other, which must have been unusual for them. Imagine walking down the street and taking a deep breath upon hearing a particular sound!"	['to make sound-smell connections']
Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"London's Chinese community dates back to the 18th century, when a small number of Chinese sailors moved to the city to work in Limehouse, east London. As time went by, other Chinese people came to this area and Limehouse began to be known as ""Chinatown"". At the start of the 20th century, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. However, this situation changed greatly after the Second World War. At this time, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs, and decided to move to London. In the 1950s, a small Chinese restaurant opened in central London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! Most of the new immigrants enjoyed their lives and the chances they were offered. Many asked their friends and relatives to join them from their hometowns, and a lot of families were reunited again at this time. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful. The sons and daughters of the first restaurant workers, encouraged by their parents, studied very hard at school and university. And most got highly-paid jobs. As a result, increasing numbers of Chinese families left Chinatown and moved to the more expensive places. Chinatown, however, is still as lively as ever, and a must-see for any visitor to London."	['With the help of the British government, Chinatown was very successful.']
Why may some guests feel regretful when they arrive in San Diego?	Planning for the weather No matter what time of year you vacation in San Diego, be sure to bring a light jacket or sweater and bring shorts. During our summer months, we have warm days but cool evenings, especially if you are near the ocean. Those cool evenings can feel cold and fresh if you are visiting from someplace that is typically hot and damp all summer. And during our winter months, we can have days that reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). In fact, our winter months are the sunniest months of the year along the San Diego coast. How to get around San Diego Deciding whether you need to rent a car for your visit to San Diego? If you are planning to visit attractions in and around downtown San Diego, including SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park, Old Town, Coronado, and the Gaslamp Quarter, all of these attractions can be readily accessed by public transportation assuming the hotel or place you are staying in is close to a bus or trolley stop. Tour guests comment on how easy it is to use our transportation system, how clean it is, and the low cost for a one-day or multi-day pass that works on both buses and trolleys. However, if you are going to visit attractions further away from downtown San Diego such as the Safari Park or Legoland or if you want to visit our local mountains or desert, we recommend a car rental. How to make time for all the things to do Our final tip for now is to plan ahead. Unlike most cities where there may be a few concentrated tourist areas and it's easy to find things as you go, San Diego offers hundreds of attractions and guests tell us they are overwhelmed and certainly didn't plan enough time once they find how much there is to do in San Diego. Many guests visit San Diego as part of an extended trip that includes San Francisco and Los Angeles. They often plan fewer days in San Diego because they assume it is the smallest city with the least to offer only to say they wished they had planned more days in San Diego because it offers more things to do in a much more relaxing environment. By planning ahead you can also get discounts for various attractions. For example you can save a lot of money at SeaWorld if you buy your tickets in advance online, at a visitor center or through your hotel. Another reason to plan ahead is that some attractions close early or get sold out since San Diego is a big destination for major conventions and big companies bringing in employees from around the world for special events in beautiful, sunny San Diego.	"[""Because they haven't planned enough time to visit the city.""]"
What can we infer from the passage?	"When I was fifteen, I announced to my English class that I was going to write and illustrate my own books. Half the students sneered. The rest nearly fell out of their chairs laughing. ""Don't be silly, only geniuses can become writers,"" the English teacher said, ""And you are getting a D this semester."" I was so humiliated that I burst into tears. That night I wrote a short sad poem about broken dreams and mailed it to the Capri's Weekly newspaper. To my astonishment, they published it and sent me two dollars. I was a published and paid writer. I showed it to my teacher and fellow students. They laughed. ""Just plain dumb luck,"" the teacher said. I tasted success. I'd sold the first thing I'd ever written. That was more than any of them had done and if it was just dumb luck, that was fine with me. During the next two years I sold dozens of poems, letters, jokes and recipes. By the time I graduated from high school, with a C minus average, I had scrapbooks filled with my published work. I never mentioned my writing to my teachers, friends or my family again. They were dream killers and if people must choose between their friends and their dreams, they must always choose their dreams. I had four children at the time, and the oldest was only four. While the children slept, I typed on my ancient typewriter. I wrote what I felt. It took nine months, just like a baby. A month later Crying Wind, the title of my book, became a best seller, was translated into fifteen languages and Braille and sold worldwide. I appeared on TV talk shows. I traveled from New York to California and Canada on promotional tours. My first book also became required reading in native American schools in Canada. People ask what college I attended, what degrees I had and what qualifications I have to be a writer. The answer is: ""None."" I just write. I'm not a genius. I'm not gifted and I don't write right. To all those who dream of writing, I'm shouting at you: ""Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Don't listen to them."" I don't write right but I've beaten the odds. Writing is easy, it's fun and anyone can do it. Of course, a little dumb luck doesn't hurt."	['It is difficult for a person, who cares about what others say, to succeed.']

Why did Jenny spend a lot of money on the snacks?	"I'll be the first to admit that I am a technophobe .Who would have guessed that a website would help repay a 20-year-old loan? I'1l always remember my last day at school. My best friend, Jenny, had organized a party in the Sixth Form Common Room; Jenny asked me to go to the supermarket with her to buy all the snacks. ""I'm really looking forward to this party, Stingy,"" she said. Everyone called me Stingy instead of Debbie because they thought I didn't like to spend money. Actually, it was true. ""There's lots of money in the kitty . Let's go crazy!"" Going crazy meant buying enough snacks to feed an army. It came to PS 19.90,which was a lot of money in 1982. Jenny gave me a guilty( ) look. ""I've left-the kitty money in the common room. Can you pay and I'll give you back the money?"" ""Sure,"" I replied, trying to look relaxed.

So great that I completely forgot about my loan until I was flying to America the next day. I was going to live with my uncle's family until I started university.

The passage is mainly about _ of Venice .	A city without cars would be very strange , right ? But Venice is such a city . Venice is in the northeast of Italy. It wasn't built on land, like Beijing or Shanghai, but on more than 110 islands. Seawater is everywhere around the city. Even so, travel isn't that difficult. The waterways have always been the best way to get around. There are 117 waterways and more than 400 bridges that can guide you where you want to go. People in Venice move from place to place by boat. Water makes the city special, but it is also a big problem. Sometimes tourists will have such strange experiences . One moment they walk across the Rialto Bridge , and there's nothing special . But when they come back to the bridge an hour later , it's underwater and everyone is wearing rain shoes . Once, people used too much underground water. This made the city get lower little by little. Now the city has gone down by 23 centimeters. Another problem is the rising seawater. The temperature has risen over the years. This has made ice of the Arctic Ocean melt . Every year, high waters hit the city in autumn and winter. When a lot of water comes, more than half of the city is underwater. Scientists are trying different ways to stop the city from getting even lower. The Italian government has asked some of Italy's biggest companies to build the MOST project , which was planned to be built under the seawater to stop the rising water . Anyway , this project is helping solve the problem .	['the specials and problems']

What didn't happen to the freed kite?	"One windy spring day, I observed young people having fun using the wind to fly their kites. Multicolored creations of varying shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds dashing and dancing in the exciting atmosphere above the earth. As the strong winds gusted against the kites, a string kept them in check. Instead of blowing away with the wind, they arose against it to achieve great heights. They shook and pulled, but the controlling string and the clumsy tail kept them in tow , facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled and trembled against the string, they seemed to say, ""Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!"" They flew beautifully even as they fought the forced restriction of the string. Finally, one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. ""Free at last,"" it seemed to say. ""Free to fly with the wind."" Yet freedom from control simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic gentle wind. It flew ungracefully to the ground and landed in a twisted mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. ""Free at last"". Free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be blown helplessly along the ground, and to settle down lifeless against the first roadblock. How much like kites we sometimes are. There always exist misfortunes and restrictions, rules to follow from which we can grow and gain strength. Prohibition is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition. Some of us pulled at the rules so hard that we never fly fast to reach the heights we might have obtained. If we keep all the commandment , we will never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground. Let us each rise to the great heights, recognizing that some of the prohibitions are actually the steady force that helps us climb and achieve."	['It kept flying freely in the air.']
How far can you travel on a Segway at most?	What do you use to get around town? A car? A bike? Your feet ? perhaps you should try a segway! The Segway is perfect for short journeys. It's an electric vehicle that consists of a platform between two wheels, with a pole that connects the platform to the handlebars. To ride it , you step up onto the platform, and control the Segway by moving your body. Lean forwards to go faster, and back-wards to slow down. On older models, direction was controlled by a twist grip on the left handlebar. This varies the speeds between the two motors, and a decrease in the speed of the left wheel would turn the Segway to the left . With newer models you simply lean to the left or right. Meanwhile, a gyroscope detects your movements and prevents the machine from falling over. The Segway has a maximum speed of 19 km per hour and a range of about 38 km. after that, you need to plug it and recharge the battery. Segways are used for a variety of purposes. People with mobility problems can now enjoy walks in the country with their friends and family. Some golfers see them as an alternative to the golf cart . And dog owners now have an easier way to take the dog to the park. A few police forces use Segways, too. They allow officers to move quickly while maintaining contact with the public. They're also becoming a common sight on airport . However, the most popular use is in tourism , particularly for city tours . Visit any major tourist city in summer, sit outside a cafe for a while and there's a good chance you'll see a group of tourists passing on Segways.	['About 38 km']
Bali is distinguished from the rest of Indonesia by _ .	"Bali is an Indonesian island rich in indigenous culture. A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the ""now"". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be ""just like Bali"". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry. One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly knit that all members usually reside in the same complex. Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called ""Hindu Darma"". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this.The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia. In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to conserve their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have preference either for music, dance, or painting. Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the series of ceremonies and rituals known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and color1ful event for the Balinese."	['the influence of Hinduism on their culture.']
My Yearbook.com is becoming popular because _ .	"""I don't want to buy a traditional yearbook. I can keep and share memories of my high school on the Internet.""You may often hear this from many American high school students now. Instead of buying a book, more and more students choose to sign up at My Yearbook.com. My Yearbook.com was created by two teenagers, Catherine Cook and her brother, 18-year-old David Cook, in 2005. They built it up to about 950,000 members in a year. The site allows people to create a profile with separate sections for high school, college, graduate school and professional life. Students who sign up are linked to other people at their school. Acting as their own editors, they can select friends from their classmates. The site also connects students through clubs and spprts pages. Like other so-called social-networking sites, it allows members to show photos and post messages. Students can do lots of things that old-fashioned yearbooks can't offer, including hearing music and watching videos. Catherine and David developed the idea because they thought that their own yearbooks weren't good enough and were too expensive. ""We just think yearbooks are obsolete,"" said Catherine Cook, 16.""If you think about it, all you're going to do with it is put it on the shelf and never really look at it."" Many American teenagers want different things out of their yearbooks than their parents did. They like the idea of creating an online yearbook. That is the reason why My Yearbook.com is becoming more and more popular. Some people, however, still wonder if this free website can ever truly replace the traditional printed book of high-school memories-even for the generation that have grown up with the Internet. Some students would like to be the users of the My Yearbook.com as well as buy a traditional yearbook. The""war"" between the tradition and the new technology will never end. Everyone is free to choose what he prefers and even has both."	['teenagers like the idea of creating an online yearbook']

Which of the following statements is true?	Hawaii is an important trading center and about six million tourists visit there every year. With all that traffic in and out, exotic species have plenty of opportunities to reach the islands. According to biologists, exotic species are the number one threat to the state' s economy, environment, and way of life. The question in Hawaii is, can the invaders be stopped? Quarantines are one way to do this. Quarantine is the process of isolating animals or products. In Hawaii, pet dogs and cats coming into the state remain in a special holding facility for four months to make sure they don' t have rabies( ) Many agricultural products are also quarantined to see if they are carrying insect pests or plant diseases. Inspection is a second way to stop biological invaders. At airports, borders, and shipping ports, inspectors examine passengers and their baggage to see if they are carrying exotic species. The inspectors also destroy fruits, vegetables, or other goods that might be carrying harmful pests or diseases. Specially trained dogs also smell goods in the ship for exotic species. What if an exotic species slips by inspectors? Then efforts are made to control the invader. In Hawaii,government agencies control invaders by setting livetraps around wildlife shelters and other places. At Haleakala National Park employees have built miles of fences to keep out exotic pigs and goats. For years these animals ate and walked over native rain forest plants, hut the fences have helped reverse( )this damage. Now native plants grow in places that were bare rock only a short time ago. In some cases biological control helps to solve the exotic species problems. It is the science of controlling one invader with another. In the early 1900s, several exotic predators were imported to Hawaii to eat a harmful exotic pest called the sugarcane leafhopper. The insect was destroying 70,000 tons of sugar a year ,but the predators brought it under control. The efforts of these scientists and other people are vitally important. In Hawaii alone,10,000 different species of native plants and animals still need to be protected. Many of these are found nowhere else on earth. By stopping the spread of the biological invaders, we not only protect ourselves, but we also protect the many other native species that make our planet such a special place to live.

How did Louis Braille invent Braille?	Inventions named after people Many new things are invented each year. Interestingly, some inventions are named after the people who invented them, making the inventions and inventors easier to be remembered. The bowler hat is named after London hat-makers Thomas and William Bowler. The brothers received an order from Edward Coke, the younger brother of the 2ndEarl of Leicester. They were asked to design a hat for Coke's gamekeepers to protect _ heads from branches while on horseback. Later, the stylish hat became popular in Europe and the United States. Another invention that is named after its inventor is Braille, a writing system used by blind people. French educator Louis Braille developed a new system of reading and writing after learning the cryptography of French Captain Charles Barbier during the war. The captain had come up with a code of dots on paper that allowed soldiers to communicate in the dark. The diesel engine is also named after its inventor----German engineer Rudolf Diesel. After a few dangerous tests, he invented a new and more efficient engine in 1892 and the engine was later called the diesel engine. The engines were widely used in buses, trucks, trains and ships, and Rudolf Diesel became a millionaire.	['He invented Braille based on the cryptography of a French captain.']
We can guess Beethoven (a world-famous musician) may have.	The size and shape of your ears show your character more than any other parts of the face. Other parts of the face change shape as we get older, but ears do not change their shape. They only change in size. Reading people's character from their ears is an old science. In very old times people thought that a person with big ears had a good and generous character. They thought that a person with pale, small ears was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ear showed if a person was musical. Today, too many people believe that the size and the shape of the ear help you know if a person is musical. Ears are all different, and each characteristic has a meaning. Next time when you look at a person, see if his ears are large, medium-size or small. Look at the lobes (the lowest part of the ear).

Telephone calls cause a problem because _ .	Employees are being flooded with too much information that has little to do with their work, according to a new survey. On average, white-collar workers spend 51 percent of their work time receiving and processing information. Only one third of it was relevant to their work, the survey found. Information overload for white collar workers has become a global issue. The huge amount of information has already affected their efficiency in management as well as their performance at work. Buried with e-mails Every morning, a secretary at the human resources department of an auto parts company opens her e-mail box, only to find it crammed with at least 50 unread mails. For her, even scanning through these e-mails every day takes at least half an hour. Some of her colleagues are not so lucky -- they have to read at least 100. Bothered with calls Telephone calls are also causing a problem. More than 40 percent white-collar workers chose mobile phones as the preferred way to communicate important and urgent business matters. Talking saves time and energy over the clicking, reading and replying to e-mails, but phone calls are also more distracting . While answering a call, a clerk is likely to put away a much more important task at hand and start the business being talked about on the phone. Solution? Not yet. Many companies start with providing staff with better computers, better Internet access and more advanced gadgets . For example, staff members above a certain level in one company will be provided with a blackberry phone for easier access to their e-mails. The company has also organized many lectures on efficient ways of e-mail management. Yet most white-collar workers think their companies can do more.

According to the author, the jealousy emotion is _ .	You know how wonderful you are, and you know that others know how wonderful you are, but what do you do when admiration crosses over the line into jealousy ? For most teens there will come a day when you realize that one of your friends is jealous and that this jealousy is hurting your friendship. When this happens it can seem like there is nothing that you can do, but the good news is that there is. Don't let jealousy spoil your relationships. Deal withitconfidently and you might be back to normal much sooner than you think. It can be hard to walk up to a friend and ask them what the problem is, but if you want to save your friendship you'll have to do just that. Don't approach them and ask why they are jealous of you unless of course you want to appear totally conceited , just take some time alone with them and let them know that you've been feeling like there's been something coming between you. If they refuse to respond, then use the opportunity to explain how you have been feeling. Chances are that something you say will strike a nerve and your friend will open up as well. When you figure out what is annoying your friend, ask him or her what (s)he thinks would make the situation better. If, for example, (s)he says that (s)he feels like (s)he doesn't get to spend any time with you because of your being off with your new friends from the swim team then maybe you could invite her along the next time or block off one day a week for just the two of you. Remember, though, that whatever solution you decide on should be a compromise. Don't limit your own talents or opportunities simply because your friend is unhappy. Try instead to include him or her in your new life and see how that works out. Even the best of friendships can be ruined by jealousy. This destructive emotion is rarely productive and can turn best friends into worst enemies. Before taking extreme action, chat with your jealous friend to see if the two of you can work out a compromise. If you can't, be prepared to know exactly how far you will go to keep your friend and how far you won't.	['destructive']
According to Baroness Jolly, _ .	"Families should not waste their money on organic food,the government has warned.They should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford,even if it means eating frozen vegetables.The government now faces calls to endPS20 million of subsidies to organic farming. A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 percent more antioxidants than non-organic crops.But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic food is a healthier option.Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables,the government is at pains to stress that families should not waste their money on organic food.Just 30 percent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day.

For what reason was Wang made known to the public?	"A father in Wuhan, nicknamed ""Eagle Dad"" for his controversial parenting style, has dismissed critics' claims that he pushes his 4-year-old son too hard. Police officer Wang Shaoyan came under the spotlight this month after his child took part in an 18-kilometer race in the Hubei provincial capital. Some parents attacked his methods of extreme physical training, while others reacted strongly to his admission that he regularly exposes the youngster to cold showers. ""I just want my son to reach his full potential,"" Wang said, adding that 4-year-old son not only runs 3 km every day he also takes cold showers from time to time to strengthen his body's resistance and willpower. ""He has never taken any sick leave from kindergarten,"" he said proudly. However, some parents find his methods too extreme. ""I'm not sure a 4-year-old is prepared for such intense training,"" said Zhang Ruxia a woman who gave birth to two boys in October in Tianjin. ""You can have good intentions to train your child at an early age but you also have to consider whether he can take it."" Wang responded by saying children are too young to make decisions, and it is up to parents to lead them on the right path. ""I read many materials before and the whole process is step-by-step without pushing or imposing on my son,"" Wang said. The father said he was not acting rashly but following a scientific way of education. He said the doubts about his methods reflect the declining standards of modern education. ""Many people in Japan give their children cold showers too ,and no one is fussing about it,"" he said. The traditional way of education applied by most of his peers might not necessarily help bring the best out of a child he said. Wang said in addition to the physical training, he has also laid out a detailed and particular program to strengthen the intelligence of the child. ""I have hired some university students to expand his knowledge in natural sciences, while playing the video for English-language teaching as well,"" he said."	['He made his kid take a long distance race.']
If a Japanese purposely bumps his head again after an accidental bump, we can be sure that .	"There are over one million superstitions , and most people believe at least one or two of them. Many people are superstitious about numbers. They think that there are lucky numbers and unlucky numbers. The number 13 is often considered unlucky. In some parts of the world, buildings have no 13th floor and streets have no houses with the number 13. In Japan, ""4"" is considered unlucky because in Japanese the word ""four"" is pronounced the same as the word ""death"" . Japanese never give gifts of four knives, four napkins, or four of anything. What are the lucky numbers? Seven is a lucky number in many places, and ""8"" is considered a lucky number in Japan and China. In China, businesses often open on August 8, and many couples register to get married at eight past eight on August 8. Superstitions about numbers are so widespread that some people--called numerologist--make a living by giving advice about numbers. In 1937, when the Toyoda family of Japan wanted to form a car company, they asked a numerologist if ""Toyoda"" would be a good name for the company. The numerologist said it would not be. He explained that ""Toyota"" would be a better name for the company. The family took his advice. As a result, millions of people drive ""Toyota"" and not ""Toyoda"" . There are many other kinds of superstitions. There are superstitions about eating, sleeping, sneezing and itching . There are superstitions about animals and holidays and horseshoes. There are even superstitions about superstitions. Those superstitions will tell people how to reverse bad luck. When the Japanese bump heads, they immediately bump heads again. According to a Japanese superstition, the first-bump means their parents will die, but the second bump ""erases"" the first bump To reverse bad luck in general, people turn around three times, turn their pockets inside out, or put their hats on backwards. In the United States, baseball players sometimes wear their caps backwards when their team is losing. It looks silly, but the baseball players do not mind if it helps them win the game."

Why did JoJo make up his mind to help James? _ .	"One Sunday, I took my daughter to the seaside. On arriving at the beach, I saw JoJo, a wealthy man in hotel business. We sat down to chat in an open air cafe while I watched my daughter enjoy herself on the swings in front of us. Suddenly, our conversation was interrupted by a stranger, who politely asked permission to speak to me privately. People often want to tell me something about my TV show. We stood a bit away from my table. He said, ""I'm James, the father of a 7-year-old girl who's very sick. The doctors said that if she was treated in the UK, she would probably survive. But I'm poor, so can you help me, please?"" I stared into the man's eyes full of tears and asked how I could help. After I went back, JoJo asked me, ""What's wrong?"" I told him about it and he was very sorry for that family. All day I thought about James's family. I even thought about making a special TV show to raise money for the sick child. On Monday morning, JoJo walked into my office. Actually, JoJo was very busy, and I never imagined he would have the time to come and see me. ""Please, call the man and tell him I'll pay all the expenses for the girl's treatment,"" JoJo said with a cheque in his hand. ""I've been married for 35 years; I wasn't lucky enough to have a child. Sometimes I feel lonely. I want to help this child."" I picked up the phone to call James. Now James's daughter is well and JoJo sometimes goes to visit her. I'm so happy that there are so good people on this earth."	['To show his love for a child.']
Bilingual children are more likely to _ .	In the early nineteen fifties, researchers found that people scored lower on intelligence tests if they spoke more than one language. Research in the sixties found the opposite. So which is it? Researchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The latest evidence shows that being bilingual does not necessarily make people smarter. But researcher Ellen Bialystock says it probably does make you better at certain skills. She says bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention--a function called the executive control system. Ms Bialystock is a psychology professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. She says the best method to measure the executive control system is called the Stroop Test. A person is shown words in different color1s. The person has to ignore the word but say the color1. The problem is that the words are all names of color1s. Her work shows that bilingual people continually practice this function. They have to, because both languages are active in their brain at the same time. They need to limit one to be able to speak in the other. This mental exercise might help in other ways, too. Researchers say bilingual children are better able to separate a word from its meaning, and more likely to have friends from different cultures. Bilingual adults are often four to five years later than others in developing dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Foreign language study has increased in the United States. But linguist Alison Mackey at Georgetown University points out that English-speaking countries are still far behind the rest of the world. In England, like in the United States, bilingualism is seen as something special and unique and something to be commented on and perhaps work towards, while in many other parts of the world being bilingual is just seen as a natural part of life.

What's FALSE of the study led by a team from the University of Zurich?	Imagine this situation. You pass a group of people. The people are talking to each other. You cannot hear what they are saying. But suddenly they start laughing. What would you think? Would you think they were laughing at something funny that one of them said? Or -- be honest with yourself -- would you think they were laughing at you? Yes, you. Being laughed at is a common fear. But a major study published in two thousand and nine found that this fear is not the same around the world. It differs from culture to culture. People in Finland were the least likely to believe that people laughing in their presence were making fun of them. Less than ten percent of Finns in the study said they would think that, compared to eighty percent of people in Thailand. Some people in the study said they felt unsure of themselves in social situations but hid their feelings of insecurity. Others said they avoided social situations where they had been laughed at before. The study found that people in Turkmenistan and Cambodia were more likely to be in the first group. They would hide their feelings of insecurity if they were around other people's laughter. But people in Iraq, Egypt and Jordan were more likely to try to avoid such situations if they felt they had been laughed at before. Shy people often avoid situations that would force them into close contact with other people. They worry that something they say or do will make other people laugh at them. But some people worry much more than others. They may have a disorder called gelotophobia. Gelos is a Greek word. It means laughter. Phobia means fear. This fear of laughter can be truly sad for those who live with it. It can affect how they lead their lives. In the study, a team from the University of Zurich led more than ninety researchers from around the world. They wanted to understand the difference between normal shyness and true gelotophobia. Another purpose of the study was to compare the levels of fear of being laughed at in different cultures. The researchers surveyed more than twenty-two thousand people in forty-two different languages. The findings appeared in the scientific journal Humor.	['They did such a survey in order to prevent people from being laughed at in public.']
Which statement is NOT right according to the passage?	"Barack and Michelle Obama have two daughters: Malia, born in 1998, and Sasha, born in 2001. Before his inauguration, President Obama published an open letter to his daughters in Parade magazine, describing what he wants them and every child in America ""to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world."" While living in Chicago, they kept busy schedules. Soccer, dance and drama for Malia, gymnastics and tap for Sasha, piano and tennis for both. Malia and Sasha attended the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, DC. The Obama girls began classes there on January 5, 2009. In his victory speech on the night of his election, President Obama repeated his promise to Sasha and Malia to get a dog to take with them to the White House. On April 12, 2009, it was reported that the Obamas had adopted a six-month-old Portuguese water dog given to them as a gift. The dog was named Bo by Malia and Sasha. Though Malia and Sasha Obama are the president's kids, it doesn't mean they'll be catered to. The girls are still required to do their chores. Besides bed-making, Malia and Sasha must clean up their rooms and keep on top of their homework. The Obamas want their girls to grow up in a ""normal"" way."

Things are often put into food to make it _ according to the passage.	"""You are what you eat,"" says the old saying. So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria. What you can do: Try to get organic food. Organic food doesn't have any ingredients that are bad for the land, air or water. Don't eat processed food or drinks. Eat fresh food whenever you can and cook at home."	['delicious and look good']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	If you're like most students, you may find it challenging to learn a foreign language. However, there are a few tips you can use in order to earn a top grade ---- as well as actually use the skills you've learned. One of the most important and basic lessons in dealing with a foreign language is to learn and understand each concept and lesson before moving on to the next one. If you don't understand one concept but move on to the next chapter anyway, you're less likely to understand the new material. Learning a new language is not only an academic tool, but can help you in your everyday life as well. Being good at another language can help you communicate with other people, and help you when traveling to foreign countries, and even make your resume look better. And it is important to learn correct pronunciation as soon as possible for poor pronunciation can be hard to break. Native speakers of the language as well as others fluent in the language you are learning will appreciate your efforts to learn correct pronunciation. Gather outside materials such as books, study guides, books on tape, and travel books to aid you in learning the language. Your textbooks can't possibly teach you everything you need to know, so seeking outside sources is generally a good rule of thumb to keep in mind. A significant motivator in learning a foreign language is traveling to the country where the language is spoken. That way, you can see firsthand how the language is used, learn the culture, and meet native speakers of the language. Native speakers appreciate sincere attempts of others who take the time to learn their language. Seek out native speakers of your new language in your school or neighborhood. They can help you with many skills, including pronunciation, and they can provide immediate feedback on your progress.	['learning pronunciation well from the very beginning is very important']
What is mainly discussed in the passage?	"When did you last visit a shopping mall? In many places, the answer would be ""last weekend."" Some people go even more often. Why? For one thing, malls offer goods and services that people need all in one place: food, clothing, things for their houses, entertainment, even medical services. So, are malls one of the highlights of modern civilization? Environmental activists would say No! They would go even further and say that consumer behavior is causing a huge environmental disaster. cause consumers of ignorance of the side effect of their shopping--urban sprawl . Social scientists agree that patterns of development have changed the landscape a great deal in the last half century. Before 1950, most people lived in towns or cities and either walked to work or took public transportation. Only very wealthy people had automobiles. Farmers lived in rural areas or isolated villages and came into town only when they needed things they couldn't produce themselves. If you gazed at the landscape you would see towns surrounded by countryside. Then a massive change occurred. Automobiles became affordable and people were quick to adopt them. Now ambitious workers could live in the suburbs, the areas just outside cities, which started to grow rapidly. As long as there was lots of cheap land in the suburbs, no one paid much attention to the usage of that land. Malls, fast food restaurants, cinemas, and car dealerships spread out in large, flat buildings. These one-storey buildings and their parking lot took up a great deal space. Well- meaning farmers thought they were better off selling their land than growing crops. In ignorance, no one realized that once the land was built up in urban sprawl, the good farming land would be ruined forever. There was no way to preserve it. Only in recent years have people come to mourn the old way of life as they have developed insight into the problems. Now people realize that urban sprawl has come with serious environmental problems. The negative aspects of sprawl include air and water pollution, loss of agricultural land, traffic jams, and the death of businesses in the old town centers. Many scholars think the time has come to analyze the problems better so we can develop appropriate policies to control further sprawl. Some think the best way to do is to educate citizens about their priceless environment."	['Urban Sprawl']

Why has testing medicines on children always been a controversial issue?	"LONDON (Reuters) -- Children are dying for lack of drugs tailored to their needs, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which launched a global campaign on Thursday to promote more research into child medicine. More than half of the drugs currently used to treat children in the industrialized world have not been specifically tested on youngsters. The problem is even worse in developing countries where price remains a major barrier and 6 million children die each year from treatable conditions. In the case of HIV/AIDS, the few existing pediatric therapies developed for children generally cost three times more than adult ones. As a result, clinicians lack clear guidelines on the best drug to use and often have to guess at the correct dose. Fortunately, the WHO has drawn up the first international List of Essential Medicines for Children, containing 206 products considered safe for children. ""But a lot remains to be done. There are priority medicines that have not been adapted for children's use or are not available when needed,"" said Dr Hans, the U.N. agency's director of medicines policy and standards. Medicines that need to be adapted to children's needs include many antibiotics, pain drugs as well as combination pills for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The agency is building an Internet entrance linking to clinical trials carried out in children and will launch a Web site with the information early next year. Testing medicines on children has always been a controversial issue, since good ethical practice requires informed agreement from people participating in clinical trials, which is difficult to obtain in the case of children. As a result, research-based drug companies have been _ of developing child-friendly medicines and general companies have been slow to produce them at lower cost. In an attempt to deal with the issue, both Europe and the United States now have special rules offering extended patent protection for drugs that have been tested on children."	['It is hard to get informed agreement from children tested.']
The author is obviously challenging the social norm that _ .	As goods and services improved, people were persuaded to spend their money on changing from old to new, and found the change worth the expense. When an airline equipped itself with jets, for example, its costs (and therefore air fare) would go up, but the new planes meant such an improvement that the higher cost was justified. A new car (or wireless, washing machine, electric kettle) made life so much more comfortable than the old one that the high cost of replacement was fully repaid. Manufacturers still cry their goods as persuasively as ever, but are the improvements really worth paying for? In many fields, things have now reached such a high standard of performance that further progress is very limited and very, very expensive. Airlines, for example, go to enormous expense in buying the latest jets , in which vast research costs have been spent on ly small improvements. If we abandon these vast costs we might lose the chance of cutting minutes away from flying times; but wouldn't it be better to see airfares drop dramatically, as capital costs become ly insignificant? Again, in the context of a 70 m. p. h. Limit, with lines of cars traveling so close as to control each other's speeds, improvements in performance are actually irrelevant; improvements in handling are unnecessary, as most production cars grip the road perfectly, and comfort has now reached a very high level. Small improvements here are unlikely to be worth the thousands that anybody replacing an ordinary family car every two years may have spent on them. Let us instead have cars -- or wireless, electric kettles, washing machines, television sets -- which are made to last, and not to be replaced. Significant progress is obviously a good thing, but the insignificant progression from model-change to model-change is not.	['slightly improved new products are worth buying']
.What do you think the foreigners may not be insulted with?	Being shy keeps many Chinese people from getting to know westerners. You may feel nervous about making language mistakes in front of a native English speaker. But remember, westerners living in Asia know how it feels to try to communicate in a foreign language. They have made many mistakes when speaking Chinese! So don't worry about speaking imperfect English. The important thing is just to communicate. Start talking, and make some foreign friends! Many westerners value their privacy . Don't be surprised if your new friend doesn't want to include you in everything he does. This may seem strange to Chinese who worry about that their friends will get lonely. Chinese people often expect their good friends to give advice and take care of them in many ways. If you expect this kind of care from westerners, you may be disappointed. Why? Because most westerners value _ . They feel insulted if others think they can't take care of themselves. They will assume you feel the same way. Of course, these tips are just rules of thumb and may not apply to all westerners. Each person you meet will have his or her own ideas about friendship. When you get confused , don't be shy and worry to ask questions. Your new western friends may also have many questions about Chinese culture, and they may be hesitant to ask. So encourage them to ask questions, too. Be honest and open to your friends. Respect each other's differences. The friendships you make can be lifelong treasure both for you and your new friends.

How did Nancy come to lose her ring?	One day newly wedded Nancy lost her ring while helping to plant potatoes. Friends were called and the field was searched long but _ . Later, when the potatoes were harvested, Everyone looked out for the ring but it remained lost. Another year came round and all the farmers working in the field kept their eyes open. The following year was the same. And year after year, whoever had business in the field always had Nancy's ring in his mind. Then the farm changed hands but it went no farther than to cousins. So the memory of the lost ring remained alive until thirty-eight years had passed. Then came a spring day when a man was ploughing the field behind a pair of horses. Even after thirty-eight years he still looked out for the ring, and knew just which part of the field Nancy had lost it in. At this time, when he came there, he found it .He picked it up, put it carefully into his pocket, left his horse, and ran all the way down to the village and placed it into Nancy's hand.

How many advantages of texting are mentioned in the passage?	"Text messaging, or simply ""texting"", which allows people to send and receive messages on mobile phones, becomes very popular today. The advantages of texting are obvious. Texting helps to save money. If you have a few words to greet your families and friends on their birthdays or on some important festivals, sending messages can be cheaper than phone calling. Texting helps to save time. Even if you want to send a message to 100 people, you can do it one second. Texting helps you to ""talk"" to someone when he is too busy to answer the phone. Texting can also help you to ""talk"" to someone secretly if you don't want others to hear what you are talking on the phone. These advantages are so amazing that many people are crazy about it. They hold mobile phones in hands all day long, send dozens of messages each day, and even text while driving or walking. However, texting has its disadvantages. Junk messages may come into your mobile phone box now and then. When your phone box gets too full, you can't receive any more messages. You may therefore miss some important information. What's more, if you don't do texting properly, for example texting while driving or walking, it can be dangerous. It can cause injuries and even death. It was reported that about 6,000 people were killed and half a million were injured for this reason each year. In Fort Lee, a small town in New Jersey, USA, three people died because they walked into traffic while texting in 2011. Two researchers at Stony Brook University, New York found that texters are 60% more probably to have an accident than others. When people are texting, they don't notice other people or things around them. To reduce traffic accidents, all drivers of the UN are now not allowed to text while driving. About 32 countries have passed laws _ the use of mobile phones while driving. Texting is a wonderful way of communication. However, only when we use it properly, can we fully enjoy the fun it brings."	['Four.']
The names of streets both in London and New York _ .	"It is easy to find your way about in New York. It is _ so regularly. Instead of streets winding and twisting as they do in London, they are all regular and well planned. The streets running north and south are called ""avenues"" and are numbered, e.g. 1stAvenue, 2ndAvenue, etc. The streets going east and west are called ""streets"" and are also numbered, e.g. 51stStreet, 63rdStreet. It is all much more logical than London's street names. But I couldn't help thinking how much more interesting than these dull cold numbers are London's illogical but colorful names of streets, e.g. ""Bishopgate"" (which is not a gate and hasn't a Bishop in it); ""Haymarket"" or ""Corn market"" (where you won't see any hey or corn) or ""Poultry"" (without a living chicken anywhere in sight) or ""Thread needle Street"" (where you won't find little girls learning to sew)."

What kind of shyness can be bad according to the passage?	How do you feel when you have to make a speech in front of class? What about when you go to a birthday party? Do you get really shy? Shyness means feeling nervous or afraid when you're around other people. Experts have found that more than 80% of middle school students feel afraid to be the center of attention. Some kids are born shy. Some become shy later because of their life experiences . It's OK if it takes you a while _ when you go to a new place or meet new people. In fact, everybody gets a little shy sometimes. It's just a case of how much. Most people have red faces and talk in broken sentences when they get shy. But some become so shy that they won't go to a restaurant because they are too nervous to order and pay for their food. Some are afraid of meeting new people, so they seldom go outside. This kind of shyness can be bad for a person. If shyness doesn't stop you from doing something you want to do, being shy isn't a very big problem. Some experts say shy people are cleverer because they think more and talk less. Shy people are also good at working with others because they think more for other people. Some great people in history were shy, too. You see, being shy isn't all bad. But remember not to let good opportunities pass by just because of it! If you have to sing a song at a birthday party or practice your spoken English in front of others, just do it! There's nothing to be afraid of.

The monster Nian ate people in winter because it _ .	"Chinese people call the Spring Festival""Nian"". But do you know that Nian was once the name of a monster ? A long time ago, the monster Nian lived in the mountains. It ate animals. But in winter, it could not find food. So it came to villages and ate a lot of people. People were so afraid of Nian that they locked their doors before evening came during the winter. One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away. On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again. As soon as it opened its big mouth, people made loud noises and made fires. Nian was really afraid and ran away. wherever it went, there was noise and fire. When Nian was tired and could not run anymore, people killed the monster. After that, on the coldest day of winter, people beat drums and gongs, and set off fireworks to celebrate the death of the monster of Nian. They put up red lanterns and have a big dinner without sleeping during the night. In the morning people greet each other happily. So now we have the Spring Festival."	['had no food to eat']

There were so many people at the bus stop that it was not easy to catch a bus. Five minutes went by, I still couldn't get on one. The only thing I could do was to walk. I rushed through the crowded and ran towards my school. Unexpectedly, I hit an old woman, and she fell down. Without saying sorry, I left her and went on my way. That evening, when I was back from school, I learned that the old woman was badly hurt in the leg from the fall. Some kind people sent her to a hospital after I left. I felt very sorry and nearly cried. The only way for me to ask her pardon was to pay her a visit. The next day, I went to the hospital, I met the old woman and told her who I was. At first I thought that she would give me _ To my surprise, she didn't, but smiled. For me, that smile was worse. She touched my hand and said, ""Never mind, my girl, I knew you didn't want to hurt me, did you? Don't worry, I will be better soon."""	['The old woman understand the writer very well.']

Trudy asked. ""Because they are cheaper than those at the corner store,"" Mrs Wilson said. ""Help me check the prices."" The Wilsons were not wealthy and Mrs Wilson was always careful with her money. She looked carefully at the prices of things. She bought some groceries in the supermarket. When they got home, the children said, ""We don't think you saved money by going to the supermarket there."" ""Of course I did,"" said Mrs Wilson, ""everything was cheap there."" ""We know,"" said the children, ""but we came home by taxi because we had too much to carry. The cost of the taxi was more than the money you saved!"" Mrs Wilson added everything up and found her children were right. ""Well done,""she said, ""next time we will do shopping near our home."""	['near her home']
Good eating manners do NOT include _ .	"Be sure to book a table if the restaurant you choose is an expensive or a popular one. You will feel embarrassed to show up without booking and having to wait for a table, leaving very bad impression on your friend, especially your girl friend. Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear. When your food arrives, proper dining manners make you eat at a right pace so that you have time to talk. A good measure of how fast you should eat is to count 10 seconds between each mouthful and it's bad manners if you eat too fast and then spend the rest of the time watching your friend eat. Don't make noise when having soup and chewing, or chew with your mouth open. Your napkin should be placed on your lap at all times. Don't put it in any other place. If you have to get up, place it neatly on your seat. When eating, put your fork straight in your mouth. Don't place your fork in the side of your mouth as it increases the chances of dropping your food, which could be very embarrassing. If you get food stuck in your mouth, don't pick it out with your fingers or fork at the table. Excuse yourself and go to the restroom and get it out with a toothpick. When dining, keep your eyes on your friend at all times and try to smile between mouthfuls. Sometimes, you should make an effort to show some interest and ask questions like, ""How do you like the beef?"" If she needs, you are the one who is supposed to flag down the waiter by a gentle wave of the hand until someone notices you."	['making sounds to show how much you enjoy food']

Do I go over my notes even when there isn't a test? * Do I have a good place to do my homework? * Have I tried different ways of studying? If your worry is about a fight you had with your friend, you might write down all the things you could do----write a note to him or her, invite him or her to watch a basketball game, say sorry to him or her and so on. Once you have a list of things you could do, you can choose one thing that could get your friend back. You can ask for help when you're worried. You can find someone to talk to, such as your parents, friends, and teachers.	['invite him or her to watch a game']
Why did the dodo lose its ability to fly?	The dodo was a ground nesting , flightless bird. An adult dodo could grow to a height of about a meter and weigh between 45-50 pounds. The natural habitat of this kind of bird lay in the forest of Mauritius. Seed and fruits that were found in the forest were the main food of the dodo birds. As they could easily get the food they required in the forest, they didn't need to fly. As time went by, they finally lost the ability to fly. It turned out to be a major disadvantage for dodos, as they were left with no ability to protect themselves against human beings' attacks in their natural habitat, which drove this kind of bird to extinction . The extinction of the dodo started in 1505, when Portuguese sailors set their foot on the Island of Mauritius. Before this, the dodo didn't face any danger. People began to hunt them. It was not long before animals, like cats, pigs and monkeys, were also introduced to the island by humans. When ships arrived, the rats on these ships came onto the land. Though these animals were not able to attack huge dodos, it was easy for them to attack dodos' nests on the ground. These animals continued to feed on dodo eggs. The dodo became a relatively rare bird in Mauritius at the beginning of the 17thcentury, and became extinct in the end. The last reported sighting of a dodo was in 1681.

How will students' poor performance in maths affect the country eventually?	"LONDON, Feb. 18,2014 (Xinhua News agency) --Britain will send experts to East China's Shanghai to learn from the city's experience in maths teaching in an attempt to raise the teaching standards. British Education Minister Elizabeth Truss is to lead a delegation of experts on a fact-finding mission to Shanghai's schools next week to see how children there have become the best in the world at maths, to get a first-hand look at maths classes and teaching methods there, and particularly to investigate why the performance of almost all children in Shanghai is high, regardless of gender or income. Britain was last year placed 50th out of 148 countries and regions in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness ranking in quality of maths and science education. Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place. The top five were all in Southeast Asia, with 15-year-olds in Shanghai judged to be three years ahead of their peers in maths. The education department said: ""England's performance in maths has lagged behind while other countries have improved and overtaken us, including Poland and Germany."" Actually, it is the latest step in the government's drive to raise standards in maths, looking at what has made schools in the far East the most successful in the world in teaching the subject. ""Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths--their children are streets ahead. Shanghai and Singapore have teaching practices and a positive mind that make the difference. They have a belief that diligence makes up for lack of ability,"" Truss said. ""Our new curriculum has borrowed from theirs because we know it works--early learning of key arithmetic, and a focus on times tables and long division , for instance."" She was determined to change the situation as performance in maths is weakening the country's skills base and threatening the productivity and growth. The government is emphasizing maths because of the importance of good grades in the subject to young people competing for good jobs in a global labor market and to the economy more generally. An education and skills survey released by the Confederation of British Industry last year showed that 30 percent of employers reported dissatisfaction with the standard of school and college leavers' numeracy. More than two-thirds of employers said they wanted both maths and science promoted more in schools."	"[""By threatening the country's competitiveness of economy.""]"
It can be concluded from the passage that_.	"Ever wondered how one person could save the planet from the effects of climate change? A British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that. ""Fate of the World""puts the Earth's future in players' hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions or let it destroyed by more emissions. Through different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years. An improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year. Created by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists. ""Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,"" Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption's founder and chairman said. This year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public's interest in climate change. However, games centered on sustainability and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness. Using climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing.Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.""We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,""he added."

Which of the following statements is true?	"Each new school year brings fresh reminders of what educators call the summer learning gap.Some call it the summer learning setback.Simply speaking,it means the longer kids are out of 'school,the more they forget.The only thing they might gain is weight. Most American schools follow a traditional nine-month calendar with winter and spring breaks and about ten weeks of summer vacation.Some schools follow a year-round calendar.They hold classes for about eight weeks at a time,with a few weeks off in between.The National Association for Year-Round Education says there were fewer than 3,000 such schools at last count.They were spread among forty-six of the fifty states. But many experts point out that the number of class days in a year-round school is generally the same as in a traditional school.Lead researcher Paul von Hippel said,""Year-round schools don't really solve the problem of the summer learning setback.They simply spread it out across the year. Across the country,research shows that students from poor families fall farther behind over the summer than other students.Experts say this can be prevented.They note that many schools and local governments offer programs that can help. But calling them ""summer school"" could be a problem.The director of the summer learning center at Johns Hopkins,Ron Fairchild,said research with groups of different parents in Chicago and Baltimore found that almost all strongly disliked the term ""summer school"".In American culture,the idea of summer vacation is connected to beliefs about freedom and the joys of childhood.The parents welcomed other terms like ""summer camp,"" ""extra time"" and ""hands-on learning."""

From the passage we know that _ .	There are some places in the world where great cities once stood. There were trees, gardens and grass. But now these cities have gone and the places are like deserts. Scientists began to study this land to find out what happened. Many of them believed the land died when the trees were cut down. Trees help other plants grow and help hold the soil in place. They keep the soil from blowing away. The leaves of trees on the ground keep rainwater from running off. Trees near farms protect growing plants from strong winds. Once there were hundreds of farms in the southwestern United States. Then the farms turned into fields of dry dust. Trees might have saved these farms. But few trees grow in the dry southwest now. Now we try to save trees. In many places, when a tree is cut down , a new tree is planted in its place .

For example, he found a hole near the fireplace. ""I'll put some wood in the hole, mama. Then when a sudden storm comes up, you can stay warm. "" One cold day, Jerry sat close by me near the fire.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Spending two or three hours playing outdoors each day can reduce the chance of becoming short-sighted, a research shows. It challenges the belief that short-sightedness is caused by computer use, watching TV or reading in weak light. The Australian government researchers believe that the sunlight is good for people's eyes. They compared the vision and habits of 100 seven-year-old children in Singapore and Australia. In all, 30% of the Singaporean children were short-sighted--this rate was ten times higher than Australian children. Both groups spend a similar amount of time reading, watching television and playing computer games. However the Singaporean children spent an average of only half an hour a day outdoors--90 minutes less than the Australian children. Professor Ian Morgan, from the Australian Research Council's vision Centre, said, ""Humans are naturally long-sighted, but when people begin to go to school and spend little or no time outdoors, the number of short-sighted people gets larger. We're also seeing more and more short-sighted children in cities all around the world and the main reason may be that city children spend less time outdoors. Daylight can be hundreds of times brighter than indoor light. But why does playing outside prevent us from becoming short-sighted? Scientists believe that natural light has a special chemical which stops the eyeball from growing out of shape and prevents people from becoming short-sighted. So be outdoors. It doesn't matter if that time is spent having a picnic or having sports."	['There will be fewer risks of getting short-sighted if people spend two or three hours a day playing outside.']
When customers arrive at the check-out counter, they _	"Since I started working part-time at a grocery store, I have learned that a customer is more than someone who buys things. To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely once he or she starts to push a shopping cart. One of the first things customers forget is how to count. There is no other way to explain how so many people get in their express line, which is clearly marked 15 items or less, with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items. Customers also forget why they came to the store in the first place. Just as I finish ringing up an order, a customer will say, ""Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread. I hope you don't mind waiting, while I go to get it.""Five minutes later, he's back with the bread, a bottle of milk, and three rolls of paper towels. What is strange is that customers also seem to forget that they have to pay for their groceries. Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card while I am ringing up the groceries, a customer will wait until I announce the total. Then, in surprise, she says, "" Oh no, what did I do with my check book?"" After 5 minutes of digging through her purse, she borrows my pen because she has forgotten hers. But I have to tolerate customers because they pay my salary, and that's something I can't afford to forget."	['go back and get more items']
How did the writer prove the existence of Santa Claus as false?	"Christmas is perhaps the most important holiday in American culture. On Christmas Eve, children sit out with parents in the living room hanging stockings, setting up a Christmas tree, eating candy canes, and setting up milk and cookies for Santa Claus. Perhaps the most beloved figure in American history, Santa Claus has become an important icon for Christmas. I remember believing in Santa when I was a very young girl. However, as I grew older, I learned many facts that ""proved"" his existence as false. Always inquisitive by nature and very keen on the scientific method of experimentation, I was determined to use tests and observations to determine whether Santa Claus was real. The first year of tests happened when I was 5. I decided that if I stayed up all night on Christmas Eve, I could see if Santa really did come down the chimney. However, that was a _ attempt, I fell asleep that year. The next year, I was able to test if location was an issue with Santa's deliveries. That year, my family spent Christmas with the family of one of my mother's friends. At the time, I decided that if Santa was all-knowing he would know I wasn't home. Sure enough, there was a pretty pink package waiting for me the next morning. At age 7, I came up with my ultimate test to see if Santa was real. That year, I didn't send out my Christmas letter to Santa. On Christmas Eve, my mother dragged me to our local Wal-Mart and led me around the toy section. I refused to say a word, but did let my eye linger on a ballet set. I figured that ""Santa"" wouldn't know what to get me because he shouldn't be able to read my mind. However, mother would know everything that caught my eye in the store. If I got the ballet set the next morning, I would have my evidence. Christmas morning, there was the ballet set, sitting under the tree. As I didn't use it much, mother ended up returning it a few days later. She claimed Santa was generous enough to leave a receipt. That was the end to my mission to discover the existence of Santa. Now, I can look back on all of these with fond nostalgia . The magic and mystery of it all made Christmas a fun time. Santa was a big part of my childhood."	['He stayed up all night on Christmas Eve and saw Santa come down the chimney.']
What is the passage about?	"How green are you? Do you know how to be green? We all need a healthy environment, but we produce waste every day and it does harm to our environment. Though we are young,we can still do something to help. In fact, even the simplest everyday activities can make a real difference to the environment. Here are some ideas for you. Reduce Reduce means ""use less"",Don't waste things. This saves money and reduces pollution and waste going into the environment. Before we buy something new, think whether it is really necessary--or maybe the old one will be just as good! When we do buy things, choose local products if possible, and try not to buy too many things from abroad. Reuse Reuse means ""use again"". Use things for as long as possible. When we buy things,make sure that they last a long time. We should look after them so that they will last, and we should repair them if we can instead of throwing them away and buying new ones. Don't use a paper cup or a paper bag. It's better to use a china cup and a lunch box because you can use them again. Recycle Recycle means ""change things into something else"". Though it takes energy to change something into something else, it's better than throwing things away or burning them. Find out what can be recycled in your neighbourhood and take part in recycling programmes. We should also buy products made from recycled materials,such as recycled paper, to help save trees. So please remember these three words:reduce, reuse and recycle."	['How to be green.']
What is the purpose of an inquest when a healthy person dies suddenly?	"When someone who is in good health dies suddenly ,there is usually an inquest .A coroner will do it.His job is to find out exactly how a person died. If there is nothing suspicious about the death,he will decide that the person died from natural causes or an accident.if, however ,he is suspicious,he may decide that the person's death was caused by a person or persons unknown. One day the coroner was trying to find out exactly what had caused the death of a local businessman,Henry Watson. The man's wife was explaining something.She was very sad and had to stop from time to time.The coroner did not want to make her sadder than necessary ,but he had to find out the truth.There were questions he had to ask. ""Mrs.Watson,I know this is painful for you,""he said,""but i want you to think very carefully and then answer my questions.You and your husband were having dinner at home.Is that correct? "" ""Yes."" ''Suddenly he fell to the floor? "" ""Yes."" ""You stood up and hurried to him ?You knelt beside him ?His stomach was in great pain? "" ""Yes."" ""Did he say anything? "" The wife kept her head down. ""Please,Mrs.Watson,you must answer the question.What were his last words? "" The wife took a deep breath and then spoke.""He said,""She replied in a very low voice,""I'm not surprised that seafood we had for dinner cost you only 50 cents,"""	['To find out the cause of death.']
We should be grateful to Adam Smith because _ .	Over two hundred years ago, Adam Smith introduced some ideas which brought about a world revolution.If we enjoy a high standard of living in modem society, we owe much to this Scottish economist and philosopher.If we enjoy driving in beautiful cars, wearing fashionable shoes, or flying away to distant places for exciting holidays, we should perhaps pay thanks to the man who made it all possible. What was Adam Smith's contribution? Like so many ideas which have surprising effects, his was a simple one.He watched workers practicing their craft of pi11 making.One man would heat the strip of metal, stretch it out, cut off a suitable length, shape it, cool it and finally smooth and shine it.Smith drew attention to the advantages which could be gained if these various tasks were performed by different workers.Let one be responsible for preparing the metal.Another for stretching and cutting.Another for shaping.Another for finishing.He described the technique as the Division of Labor; in this way workers repeat the same actions again and again.Smith made the world believe that specialization could solve the problem of poverty and want. What was the result? The Industrial Revolution.Productivity was greatly increased.For Britain, where the revolution started, there was a prosperity which made it the richest country in the nineteenth century.British trains and railway lines spread out like a spider's web across the world.British ships were used to carry the new goods from one comer of the world to another. The revolution is not over.It is still with us, but now it is a worldwide phenomenon .Everywhere, factories are producing large numbers of similar products, and are in continuous production.What were called mass - production lines yesterday are called robotic productions today.The pace of change is increasing.And if these techniques have brought us prosperity, they have also brought us a little misery in overcrowded towns, boring jobs and, most of all, unemployment.

In the eyes of the Duke and Duchess, Ogilvie was _ .	"Ogilvie the detective arrived. Both the Duke and Duchess were extremely nervous. The Duchess went to the door herself. The detective's piggy eyes surveyed her. His gaze moved on to sweep the spacious, well-decorated room, and the Duke. ""Pretty neat set-up you've got.""Ogilvie said slowly. The Duchess said sharply, ""Imagine you didn't come here to discuss the decoration."" ""No, Madame. I like nice things, though. Like that expensive car of yours. The one you keep here in the hotel."" ""In what way does our car concern you?""The Duchess had sat in a straight-backed chair. ""Now,"" he said.""You two were in the hit-and-run."" She met his eyes directly. ""What are you talking about?"" ""Don't play games, lady. You saw the newspapers. There's been plenty on radio, too."" Ogilvie's words spat forth with sudden strength. ""You listen to me. This city's mad -- everybody. When they find who killed that kid and her mother, and run away, what will they do? Now I know what I know, and if I do what by rights I should, there'll be police here. But I come to you first, so you could tell your side of it to me."" The piggy eyes blinked, then hardened. ""If you want it the other way, just say so."" The Duchess--three centuries and a half of in-born pride behind her--did not give in easily. Springing to her feet with great anger, gray-green eyes burning, she faced the detective straightly. Her tone would have frightened anyone who knew her well. ""You unspeakable blackguard! How dare you!"" Ogilvie said nothing. But the Duke cut in, ""It's no go, old girl, I'm afraid. It was a good try."" Facing Ogilvie, he said, ""What you accuse us of is true. I was driving the car and killed the little girl."" ""That's more like it,"" Ogilvie said, ""now we're getting somewhere."" The Duchess sank back into her chair. She asked, ""What is it you know?"" ""I'll tell you, I got a curious nature. You and your wife drove home, you were driving, after a drink. Last night I saw you come in--through the basement, looking shaken, the pair of you. I got wondering why. Like I said, I got a curious nature."" The Duchess breathed, ""Go on."" ""Late last night the word was out about the hit-and-run. I went over the garage and took a quiet look at your car. On your car you got a damaged headlight. There's plenty of blood."" ""Oh, my God!""A hand to her face, the Duchess turned away. Her husband asked, ""What do you suggest?"" The fat man rubbed his hands together, ""Like I said, I come to hear your side of it."" The Duke said desperately, ""What can I possibly say? You know what happened. You'd better call the police."" ""There's no way bringing back the kid nor her mother. Besides, what they'd do to you, Duke, you wouldn't like it at all. I was hoping,"" Ogilvie said, ""that you could suggest something."" The Duke said uncertainly, ""I don't understand."" ""I understand,"" the Duchess said. ""You want money. You came here to blackmail us."" The house detective shrugged . ""Whatever names you call things, they don't matter to me. All I come for is to help you people out of trouble. But I've got to live too."" ""You'd accept money to keep silent about what you know?"" ""I think so."" ""How much do you want?"" The piggy eyes blinked.""Ten thousand dollars."" ""What would we receive in return?"" The fat man seemed puzzled. ""Like I said, I keep quiet about what I know."" ""No."" The statement was clear. ""We will not pay you."" Ogilvie's round face reddened, ""Now listen, lady...."" She cut him off. ""I won't listen. Instead, you will listen to me. We won't pay you $10,000. But we will pay you $25,000. In return, you will drive our car north."" ""$25,000,"" she repeated. ""$10,000 now. $15,000 more when you meet us in Chicago."" The fat man's piggy eyes were focused upon hers. The silence hung. Then, he gave the slightest of nods."	['greedy, tough but flexible']

What changed James' view towards life?	In one of the old buildings near our school,one could see an old man sitting by a large window on the first floor.His name was James.During the three years at schoo1, I had hardly ever found him missing from his usual position. He was a high-ranking government official and lived happily with his wife.Once there was a bus accident,in which a number of passengers were seriously injured and were taken to the hospital for treatment.James was responsible for the rescue operation.It was a big hospital,but James was shocked to notice how ill-equipped it was.There were no enough life-saving drugs and life--supporting equipment. The injured and their companions had to struggle there.James attempted to help.However,though he emptied his pockets,many of them died that day. That was a turning point in his life.He made a decision to devote his life to helping others, particularly the poor and needy patients and their companions.He began spending much of his income on these people.Since this required a lot of time and energy,he found it difficult to fulfill his official duties and therefore chose to retire,which,in turn,reduced his income considerably. His wife was deeply worried. Most of the time,James was out and paid least attention to home affairs.Meanwhile,as he was spending a lot helping others,she had to struggle even to meet the household expenses.Though she was not opposed to his helping the poor,she urged him not to overlook his own life and home,but it had no effect on him.One day they had a heated argument and in the end she left him,never to return.Though he continued with his work, _ was a great blow and did serious harm to his health and enthusiasm and was soon forced to stay indoors.That was when he took his position by the window,spending his time looking outside. A few weeks after my graduation,I returned to school,only to find the buildings gone.I heard that they were torn down.All the people left except James.He refused to go and the next morning,he was found at his usual place by the window,dead.

Paul and his friends enjoyed themselves on the island because _ .	"Paul and I live in the same building. His room is on the sixth floor but mine is on the fifth. He's very careless and sometimes he gets into trouble. Last Friday afternoon the young man and his friends went to spend the weekend on a wild island. They could swim, fish, play the guitar and sleep in the quiet place at night. They enjoyed themselves there. On the third morning they decided to get back to the land. But their boat hit a rock and soon went down. With the villager's help, they swam to the bank. Luckily none of them was hurt. They took a taxi and half an hour later they arrived at our town, but it was two in the night. The young man was hungry and thirsty. He wished to get home as soon as possible. Something was wrong with the lift, so he had to go up the stairs. He stopped by my door and brought out a key. Of course he could not open the door. Half an hour passed but he failed. He became angry and shouted, ""I'll cut you down with a knife!"" The noise woke me up and I opened the door. I understood at once what was happening and said, ""You're trying to open a wrong door, Paul!"" ""Sorry, I can't agree with you, Charlie!"" said the young man, ""It's my room.

What can be inferred from the text?	On February 3, a Laysan albatross , a large seabird, named Wisdom, which is 62 years old, hatched a healthy chick on a Pacific island near Hawaii,. It was the sixth year in a row this bird has hatched a chick. Wisdom's species normally lives only 12 to 40 years, while she is able to hatch healthy chicks into her 60s. At breeding time, the Laysan albatross will dig out a shallow nest in the ground. The female then lays a single egg. Both she and her mate will take turns incubating the egg until it hatches. More than seven out of every 10 Laysan albatrosses' nests are on just one island -Midway Atoll. That's Wisdom's home. But her species spends most of its time in the air. In fact, biologists observe that after learning to fly, these birds may not set foot on land for the next three to five years. Albatrosses are powerful gliders , With their six-foot, nearly two-meter, wingspan, Laysan albatrosses can ride wind currents for hundreds of miles or more. Biologists now estimate that Wisdom has flown for an unusually large number of miles-between two million and three million. That is equivalent to traveling from Earth to the moon and back-four to six times! And in the months when these birds are not breeding, they stay in the air, and even sleep there. Wild albatrosses often die long before they come close to Wisdom's age. Some are eaten. Others starve, get sick or suffer life-threatening injuries from people's fishing boats. Clearly, Wisdom is special. She may have raised as many as 35 chicks in her life.	['Wisdom has outlived her species by at least two decades.']
.The passage is most probably taken from _	Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all.	['a wildlife book']
Most of the 200 surveyed boys grew into good citizens because _ .	"Years ago a John Hopkin's professor gave a group of graduate students this task: Go to the slums . Take 200 boys, between the ages of 12 and 16, and research into their background and environment. Then predict their chances for the future. The students, after consulting social statistics, talking to the boys, and compiling much data, concluded that 90 percent of the boys would spend some time in prison. Twentyfive years later another group of graduate students was given the job of testing the prediction. They went back to the same area. Some of the boys--by then men--were still there, a few had died, some had moved away, but they got in touch with 180 of the original 200. They found that only four of the group had ever been sent to prison. Why was it that these men, who had lived in a breeding place of crime, had such a surprisingly good record? The researchers were continually told: ""Well, there was a teacher..."" They pressed further, and found that in 75 percent of the cases it was the same woman. The researchers went to this teacher, now living in a home for retired teachers. How had she exerted this remarkable influence over that group of children? Could she give them any reason why these boys should have remembered her? ""No,"" she said, ""no I really couldn't."" And then, thinking back over the years, she said amusingly, more to herself than to her questioners: ""I loved those boys."""	['a woman teacher loved and cared them']

What is the main idea of the text?	"Many years ago,a French naturalist,the Count de Buffon,wrote some books about natural history.The books were a great success even though some critics did not like them.Some critics said,""Count Buffon is more of a poet than a scientist."" Thomas Jefferson did not like what the Count had said about the natural wonders of the New World.It seemed to Jefferson that the Count had spoken of natural wonders in America as if they were unimportant. This troubled Thomas Jefferson.He too was a naturalist,as well as a farmer,inventor,historian,writer and politician.He had seen the natural wonders of Europe.To him,they were no more important than those of the New World. In 1788,Thomas Jefferson wrote about his home state,Virginia.While writing,he thought of its natural beauty and then of the words of the Count de Buffon.At that moment.Jefferson created a new word--belittle.He said.""The Count de Buffon believes that nature belittles her productions on this side of the Atlantic."" Noah Webster,the American word expert,liked this word.He put it in this English language dictionary in 1806,""Belittle--to make small,unimportant."" Americans had already accepted Jefferson's word and started to use it.In 1797,the Independent Chronicle newspaper used the word to describe a politician the paper supported.""He is an honorable man,""the paper wrote,""so let the opposition try to belittle him as much as they please."" In 1872,a famous American word expert decided that the time had come to kill this word.He said,""Belittle has no chance of becoming English.And as more critical writers of America,like those of Britain,feel no need of it,the sooner it is forgotten,the better."" This expert failed to kill the word.Today.belittle is used where the English language is spoken."	"['How the word""belittle""came into being.']"
"What does the author mean by saying ""I almost buried myself in great grief""?"	I was born in a middle class family. At one time, I was a girl who was talkative and confident. Friends around me envied me that l was always keeping a smile on my face and regarded me as a little happy swallow. However, things have changed with the passage of time. In 2006, I failed to get into my ideal university. But I didn't want to give up, so I was determined to retake the exam in 2007. At that time, I was confident in showing my abilities. Unfortunately, things didn't go well again. I can clearly remember that it was on August 15th of 2006 that my family received a bad news from my s. It wasn't until then that I came to realize how much of burdens I have to bear. Having heard that my elder sister suffered from mental illness, I couldn't help crying in class. Reluctant to accept the fact, I often said to myself 'God is just playing with me. It can't be true.' For this reason, I had struggled with these difficulties for a long time. During the fourth year of senior life, I almost buried myself in great grief. As a result, I had no appetite for study any more, and I even gave up. Consequently, I failed, once more. Looking back to the most difficult time, from 2006 to 2007, when I had no interests and low spirits every day, I often think how silly l was then. Happily, my elder sister is getting better and better under the considerate care of my family. Apart from this, thanks to my friends, l am trying to recover quickly. Gradually, I am adjusting to life in college and get along well with new dorm-mates. Everyone who hears my story would feel sorry for my experience. I need no sympathy but I would rather have more care and encouragement. I am convinced that life will be different and meaningful if I make every effort to take challenges and meet them.

Parents think it's dangerous for their kids to use blogs because _ .	"It's cool, it's hot, and everyone is doing it. People talk about _ often, and friends tell other friends how good they look. Sound like a fashion? In fact, it's another trend : ""blog"". What's a blog? A blog is a personal online diary. The word ""blogger"" means a person who writes diaries online. Many bloggers are teenagers who log onto websites to discuss anything in their lives. Many of today's teenagers are not afraid to openly discuss everything in their lives. Teenagers complain about parents and homework. They share diaries, post songs from the latest bands and show pictures of theirs. They write their own poems, say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day. However, many parents are worried about these young bloggers. Parents see the kids talking about how they got drunk last weekend and how they don't like studying. They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get messages from strangers. Most of the time, it's older men asking to meet teenage girls. ""These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words,"" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two. Many teenagers and young adults know it's not safe to use blogs on the Internet. They know they are putting information about themselves in a place they can be seen by anyone. But teenagers are unwilling to give up these new communication tools that have become a way of life for many of them."	['teen bloggers get messages from strangers']

What is Susan's secret of happiness?	"A woman Vicki once knew a young person named Susan at church. Susan always seemed happy, although Vicki knew she had faced struggles in her life. Her long-awaited marriage had quickly ended in divorce, but her whole face seemed to smile. One day Vicki asked Susan,""How is it that you are always so happy, you have so much energy, and you never seem to get down?"" With her eyes smiling, Susan said,""I know the secret!"" ""What secret is that? What are you talking about?""Vicki asked. Susan replied,""The secret is this: I have learned there is little I can do in my life that will make me truly happy. I must depend on God to make me happy and meet my needs. When a need arises in my life, I have to trust God to supply according to HIS riches. I have learned most of the time I don't need half of what I think I do. He has never let me down. Since I learned that secret, I am happy."" Vicki thought first, ""That's too simple!"" But upon reflecting over her own life, she remembered how she thought a bigger house would make her happy, but it didn't! She thought a better-paying job would make her happy, but it didn't. When did she realize her greatest happiness? Sitting on the floor with her grandchildren, playing games, eating pizza or reading a story, this is a simple gift from God."

Johns proved his ability as a salesman by _ .	"Although man has known asbestos for hundreds of years, it was not until 160 years ago that it was mined for the first time on the North American continent. H.W.Johns, owner of a New York City Supply Shop for roofers,was responsible for the opening of that first mine. Mr. Johns was given a piece of asbestos which had been found in Italy. He experimented with the material and then showed its surprising powers to his customers. After putting on a pair of asbestos gloves,which looked much like ordinary work gloves,he took red-hot coals from the fireplace and played with them in his hands. How astonished the customers were to discover that he was not burned at all. You can well imagine that he had increased business in asbestos roofing materials. However,because it was very expensive to transport them from Italy to the United States, Mr. Johns sent out a young scientist to seek a source nearer home. This young man found great vein, in the province of Quebec in Canada. Ever since 1881 Quebec has led the world in the production of this unusual mineral,which is made up of magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen. When it is mined, the asbestos is heavy, just as you would expect a mineral to be. When it is separated,a strange thing happens; the rock breaks down into fine, soft, soapy fibers. Scientists do not know why the rock can be separated easily into threads ,but they have found thousands of uses of this fireproof material, of the so- called ""cloth of stone."""

The purpose of the writer writing the passage is to _ .	"Fans are desperate to lay their hands on the larger-screen iPhone 6, thanks to Apple's ""hunger marketing"". Analysts are busy debating which of the phones giants --Apple, Samsung or Xiaomi -- leads the Chinese market. But too few people spare a thought to environmental damage caused by cell phones. Indeed, smartphones are great innovative tools, but they also make people change phones that are as good as new, and thus worsen the already serious environmental pollution. Theoretically, a cell phone can be used for eight years, but in practice one lasts 15 months on average in China, according to D. Phone. From production to disposal, cell phones, even those made by big brands like Apple and Samsung, pollute the environment. A study by the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Michigan, and ifixit.com showed that each of the 36 dissected phone models contained at least one of the following poisonous elements: lead, bromine, chlorine, mercury and cadmium. And these poisonous elements are linked to birth defects, impaired learning and other serious health problems. China, the largest phone-making country and smartphone market, should be alarmed by the environment damage caused by cell phones. So there is no reason to celebrate the ""good news"" that last year China produced about 1.46 billion cell phones, about 81.1 percent of the total global output, and 340 million smartphones were sold in the country -- a figure that is expected to cross 400 million this year. In fact, Apple's production chain best shows the urgency for China's manufacturing sector to climb up the global value chain. Apple products are designed in the US, assembled in China and sold across the world. And while Apple takes away the lion's share of the profits, Chinese workers can barely manage to keep their pots boiling and the environment ends up paying the heaviest price."

The passage tries to tell us that _ .	"Eating different colored foods can keep you healthy, as well as change your mood and behavior. Here is a list of colors, which can change your life. Blue/Purple Blue is considered to be peaceful and calming and it has the same effect on our health. The blue / purple color in food is due primarily to their anthocyanins which are antioxidants that are particularly heart healthy and may help support healthy blood pressure. Out of all the blue and purple foods available, blueberries are considered to have the highest antioxidant level. An analysis of the latest data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study found that people who eat purple and blue fruits and vegetables are at a reduced risk for high blood pressure and are less likely to be overweight. A food and health expert says that blue and purple color foods can prevent blood mass formation, and they also lower the risk of cancer. Foods that contain blue and purple colors are: reddish eggplant (especially the skin), blueberries, blackberries, purple grapes, etc. Green We all know that we should eat green as green symbolizes nature. The green foods are rich in isothiocyanates, which help resist cancer.

Diets high in those above are associated with lowered blood pressure."" Foods that contain the green color are: broccoli, cabbage, cucumbers, etc. Red Lycopene in reddish fruits and vegetables is a powerful antioxidant that has been associated with a reduced risk of some cancers, and also provides protection against heart attacks. Dr. Smiths says, ""Cooked tomato sauces are associated with greater health benefits as compared with the uncooked version as the heating process allows lycopene to be more easily absorbed by the body. Obtaining the most benefit from food depends on proper selection, storage and cooking of the produce."" Foods that contain red color are: Tomatoes and tomato products, watermelon, guava, red onions, red chili, red apples, red grapes, cherries, etc. Orange The orange foods are also rich in carotene, which are particularly good antioxidants. These foods are commonly considered eyesight foods because they contain vitamin A. ""Orange fruits and vegetables also play a part in preventing cancer, particularly of the lungs and stomach. Foods that contain the color orange are: Carrots, mangoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, etc."	['foods of different colors will have different benefits']
Who do they look for?	The first ting we do is to put an APB and this goes to all the police stations in the country. Next we telephone the hospitals. Often the person we are looking for has been in an accident. Then we might try parents, friends or relatives they might be with. We try to follow their movements and to find the last person they saw in local or national papers--especially papers they might read. There are other things we can do: put posters in places where they might be, go on television. Here in America there is a magazine in which there are photographs of missing children. This is often the last hope. Of course, with nearly two million missing children every year, we can't do all these things for everyone. We haven't got the time, or the money , or the people who work for it.	['Missing children.']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	Why do some people _ when they drink alcohol? This effect is a common reaction to alcohol among East Asians. It affects about 36 percent of Japanese, Chinese and Koreans. For many, even a small amount of alcohol can cause unpleasant effects. Most commonly, their face, neck and sometimes their whole body turn red. People might also feel uncomfortable and sick to their stomach. They might experience a burning sensation, increased heart rate, shortness of breath and headaches. The cause is a genetic difference that they are born with called an ALDH2 deficiency . It prevents their bodies from treating alcohol the way other people do. But the effects might be more serious than just a red face. Researchers warn of a link between this condition and an increased risk of cancer of the esophagus from drinking alcohol. The more alcohol people with this deficiency drink, the greater their risk is. In Japan and South Korea, for example, many people have the deficiency but still drink heavily. Researchers found that these drinkers develop a form of esophageal cancer six to ten times more often than those without the deficiency. Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers. It can be treated when found early, but once it grows the chances of survival drop sharply. The researchers estimate that at least five hundred forty million people have the deficiency, about eight percent of the world's population. Philip Brooks is a researcher at the National Institute in the United States. He says it is important to educate people about the link between the alcohol flushing effect and esophageal cancer. He says doctors should ask East Asian patients about their experiences with facial flushing after drinking alcohol. Those with a history of it should be advised to limit their alcohol use. They should also be warned that cigarette smoking works with the alcohol in a way that further increases the risk of esophageal cancer.

Why did the old man hope to give the dog to the author?	"We live in central Phoenix, near the canal . Every day I used to see a homeless old man and his scruffy little dog hanging out down there. I would tell my husband we should give him food for the little dog. It wouldn't have been a problem; we have our own ""mini farm"" of animals! But he would say ""OK!"" and then blow the idea off because of our business. Being in Phoenix, Arizona, you can just imagine how hot it gets here, but his winter was really chilly! I had just come from KFC with take-out food for dinner. As I was turning by the canal, the man and his dog were sitting right there all bundled up. Even the doggy had a coat on! Not even thinking about it, I pulled into the parking lot along the canal and piled up a plate of chicken with all the fixings for the man and his little buddy . I gave it to him with a soda and a bottle of water for the little dog. He said, ""Thank you, sweetie. You are an angel."" And there were tears welling up in his eyes! I told him he was so welcome, and then went home. When my husband dug into the KFC bag he asked, ""Were you hungry, or what?"" I told him what I did and he said, ""Only you!"" Then he told me I had done a good thing. A few weeks later, we were walking along the canal and found the man walking to me, with his little dog. He asked whether I would mind adopting the dog. With tears in eyes, he said it had gotten too hard for him to care for the dog. He added that he was planning on heading to Washington State but his dog wouldn't have been up to it, so he hoped to give it to me. ""Only you! In this city, you are the only person I can believe in!"" Now, every time I watch and pat the dog lying near the fireplace, I will remember the old man's words and wish him good luck."

British people have the habit of gathering in the pubs to _ .	"For thousands of years, the most important two buildings in any British village have been the church and the pub.Traditionally, the church and the pub are at the heart of any village or town, where the people gather together to socialize and exchange news. As a result, British pubs are often old and well preserved.Many of them have become historic sites.The most famous example is the pub in the city of Nottingham called "" Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem"" , which dates back to the year 1189 AD and is probably the oldest pub in England. However, British pubs are not just for kings and queens; they welcome people from all classes and parts of society.On a cold night, the pub's landlord or landlady can always find a warm place for you by the fire.There is always honest and hearty food and plenty of drinks available at an affordable price. That's how things used to be.Things are beginning to change.It is said that the credit crunch is causing 39 British pubs in a week to go out of business.People do not have enough spare money to spend on beer.Recently, the UK government banned smoking in all pubs, and that may also have affected the number of customers going to pubs. This decline is happening despite the fact that in 2005 the UK government started to allow pubs to stay open after 11 p.m..Previously, with 11 p.m.as closing time, customers would have to drink quite quickly, meaning they sometimes got more drunk than they would if allowed to drink slowly.The British habit of drinking a lot very quickly is known as ""binge drinking"" , and it causes long-term health problems for people and problems with violent crime for communities. In order to save their businesses, pubs are trying to change with the market.British pubs now offer something for everyone.A lot of pubs used to be ""Working Men's Clubs"" , meaning that women could not usually enter.Today, however, women can freely enter 99% of pubs without experiencing any problems.Perhaps things are changing for the better after all."

Venice has gone down by 23 centimeters because _ .	A city without cars would be very strange , right ? But Venice is such a city . Venice is in the northeast of Italy. It wasn't built on land, like Beijing or Shanghai, but on more than 110 islands. Seawater is everywhere around the city. Even so, travel isn't that difficult. The waterways have always been the best way to get around. There are 117 waterways and more than 400 bridges that can guide you where you want to go. People in Venice move from place to place by boat. Water makes the city special, but it is also a big problem. Sometimes tourists will have such strange experiences . One moment they walk across the Rialto Bridge , and there's nothing special . But when they come back to the bridge an hour later , it's underwater and everyone is wearing rain shoes . Once, people used too much underground water. This made the city get lower little by little. Now the city has gone down by 23 centimeters. Another problem is the rising seawater. The temperature has risen over the years. This has made ice of the Arctic Ocean melt . Every year, high waters hit the city in autumn and winter. When a lot of water comes, more than half of the city is underwater. Scientists are trying different ways to stop the city from getting even lower. The Italian government has asked some of Italy's biggest companies to build the MOST project , which was planned to be built under the seawater to stop the rising water . Anyway , this project is helping solve the problem .	['people used too much underground water']
Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?	"A few years ago a group of salesmen went to a meeting in Chicago. They had assured their wives that they would be home in plenty of time for Friday night's dinner. In their rush, with tickets, one of these salesmen happened to kick over a table which held a display of baskets of apples. Apples flew everywhere. Without stopping or looking back, they all managed to reach the plane in time for their boarding. All but one stopped, took a deep breath and experienced a twinge of sorrow for the girl whose apple stand had been overturned. He told his friends to go on without him, waved goodbye, and told one of them to call his wife when they arrived and explain his taking a later flight. Then he returned to where the apple stand had been overturned. He was glad he did. The 16-year-old girl was totally blind! She was softly crying, tears running down her face. The salesman knelt on the floor with her, gathered up the apples, put them into the baskets, and helped set the display up once more. As he did this, he noticed that many of them had become damaged; then he set them aside in another basket. When he had finished, he pulled out his wallet and said to the girl, ""Here, please take the $20 for the damage we did."" He continued, ""I'm sorry for what we did and hope we didn't spoil your day too badly."" She nodded with her tears. As the salesman started to walk away, the blind girl called out to him, ""Mr. ..."". He stopped, and turned back. She continued, ""Thank you very much""."	"[""A Man's Kind Action""]"
Which one of the following is WRONG according to this passage?	China has now mapped out plans for its next four launches in the Shenzhou program on the next flight. But one conclusion seems to have escaped most reports in the aerospace media. The flight of Shenzhou 7 could be timed to coincide with the Beijing Olympics. Plans for the 2008 Summer Olympics call for the events to be held between the 8th and 24th of August. It's reasonable to expect that China will use the event to promote its achievements before the world, and human spaceflight is China's most significant recent breakthrough. Shenzhou 7, China's next manned space mission, was originally advertised for 2007. This fit into the pattern of staging a two-year gap between crewed Shenzhou missions, which have previously launched in 2003 and 2005. But Chinese media statements have recently _ this to 2008. Chinese media have reported that while the overall program is going well, more time is needed to work on the spacesuit that will be used on this flight to stage China's first spacewalk. It's possible that Chinese engineers want to make best preparations for this complex mission. China could intend to carry out the mission of Shenzhou 7 just as media attention is focused on the lead-up to the Olympics. The crew of the flight, and possibly China's other flown astronauts, could then take part in the opening ceremony. China has previously feted her space travellers in great celebrations, such as the Hong Kong event that saw Yang Liwei singing with actor Jacky Chan. China has also suggested that the activity will be carried out by a single astronaut, and has indicated that half an hour is a rough estimate of the planned time for the spacewalk. China is apparently following suit, probably for the same reasons of conservative mission planning and safety.	['Two Chinese astronauts walked in space in 2003.']

What is the main purpose of this passage?	A dog might be man's best friend, but my dogs are more like my kids! I think everyone should experience the unconditional love of a dog, but owning one is not for the nervousness. It's work--especially when it comes to the job of cleaning up their waste. When you clean up after your dogs, your neighbors will love you for keeping those smelly landmines out of their yards. But there are even bigger benefits. You'll not only be doing your part to keep bacteria out of your yard and neighborhood, you're also keeping harmful microorganisms away from the drinking water supply. There are more than 77 million pet dogs in the United States and their waste is found in backyards, neighborhood parks, and the green areas that frequently line small waterways. When you don't clean up after your dog, heavy rain can carry bacteria from the waste into drains. Dog waste left in parks and other such places can be swept directly into nearby streams. This affects the quality of the water in our streams. These small channels often empty directly into our local drinking water supply or the water where we boat or fish. Dog waste contains harmful microorganisms like roundworms that can be passed onto humans. This is why dog waste should not be used as fertilizer around your home. And it won't fertilize your yard either if you leave it behind like other types of fertilizer. Dogs don't eat the same kinds of natural material that cattle, horses or even elephants eat. The waste from those animals is actually beneficial for your yard and garden. You should always pick up after your dog and throw the waste into the trash can. Some smaller cities might prefer the waste to be washed down the toilet, but in cities where there are many dogs, it's best to send the waste to the landfill. When you properly deal with your dog's waste, you'll be doing your part to keep harmful bacteria out of your yards, your neighborhoods and your drinking water.

"What's Dr Christine Grant's attitude towards ""always on"" culture?"	"You get anxious if there's no wi-fi in the hotel or mobile phone signal up the mountain. You feel upset if your phone is getting low on power, and you secretly worry things will go wrong at work if you're not there. All these can be called ""always on"" stress caused by smart phone addiction. For some people, smart phones have liberated them from the nine-to-five work. Flexible working has given them more autonomy in their working lives and enabled them to spend more time with their friends and families. For many others though, smart phones have become tyrants in their pockets, never allowing them to turn them off, relax and recharge their batteries. Pittsburgh-based developer Kevin Holesh was worried about how much he was ignoring his family and friends in favour of his iPhone. So he developed an app -- Moment -- to monitor his usage. The app enables users to see how much time they're spending on the device and set up warnings if the usage limits are breached . ""Moment's goal is to promote balance in your life,"" his website explains. ""Some time on your phone, some time off it enjoying your loving family and friends around you."" Dr Christine Grant, an occupational psychologist at Coventry University, said, ""The effects of this 'always on' culture are that your mind is never resting, and you're not giving your body time to recover, so you're always stressed. And the more tired and stressed we get, the more mistakes we make. Physical and mental health can suffer."" And as the number of connected smart phones is increasing, so is the amount of data. This is leading to a sort of decision paralysis and is creating more stress in the workplace because people have to receive a broader range of data and communications which are often difficult to manage. ""It actually makes it more difficult to make decisions and many do less because they're controlled by it all and feel they can never escape the office,"" said Dr Christine Grant."	['Critical.']

So I grabbed my guitar and plucked a string . The note sang out pure and heavenly, and there was no stopping what was coming. I sat rocking with my guitar until late into the night. I was sure I was preparing for the future much more efficiently now that I wasn't spending time writing stories. Needless to say, no story was written, and many doubts arose in my mind.

Having a gap year may make you _ .	"A ""Gap Year"" is a period of time when a student takes a break before going to university. It is often spent travelling or working. It can give young people useful learning experiences and new skills. Gap years are popular with European and Australian students, but remain less popular in America. However, in recent years, more and more American students are preparing for college by taking a gap year. The advantages of taking a gap year are as follows: Learn about the World and Yourself Although you don't have to go abroad to experience gap years, most gap year students catch the chance to travel abroad. You are able to work out who you are and what you are for. The experiences of different cultures offer you interesting lessons. You can learn more about the world and get to know yourself better. Face Challenges and Have Fun A gap year is not only a time to take a vacation, but also a time to face challenges. Gap year students usually work, volunteer or take service projects. You have to learn how to get along in the real world. This process isn't always easy, but it is an important part of growing up. Only in this way can you enjoy life and have fun. Save Money and Improve Your College Admission Chances There's a common thought that gap years are only for rich students,but it' s not true. Actually, taking a gap year can save your money. Gap year students often take a part-time job. Besides, at the end of a gap year, students are much more likely to know what to study in college. Clear learning goals ran keep the students working hard instead of wasting time and money playing. Imagine an admission officer trying to admit only one between two students. Both of them are excellent and have high grades. However, one student has much practical experience or has volunteered in his vacation. Who do you think the admission officer will choose?"

According to the writer, which of the following best describes Ray's success?	"He is a lesson to every boy who ever picked up a basketball and dreamed that it would change his life. The lights were never brighter and the crowds were never bigger for a homegrown sports hero than they were a quarter-century ago for Ray Hall. But his athletic achievements, as impressive as they are, are to my mind not what is most admirable about the man. Known as ""Sugar Ray"" in his teens, Hall was rated among the country's top 25 high school basketball players. An inner-city kid from a solid family, Hall took on the challenge of lifting Canisius College -- still recovering from its failure -- back to respectability, rejecting more favorable offers. His status of a savior brought more pressure than any 18-year-old should have to handle. However, I watched him mature into the player who led Canisius back to daylight. After college Hall played professionally in Italy and Greece for over 10 years until a car accident at 32 ended his basketball career. The news that he would never play again shocked Hall but unlike so many others he was ready for life after basketball. When I met Hall -- still fit at 46 -- for lunch Monday, he wore a cut-sharp gray suit, designer tie and blazing white shirt that screamed Success. ""That was always the question -- when the cheers end, where do you go? Who do you turn to?"" he said. ""It starts and ends with that person in the mirror."" Hall got the concept of academics-first from his parents. He graduated from Canisius a semester early. ""No matter how good of an athlete you are, you are just one injury away from losing it all,"" he said. ""But if you take care of things academically, you are prepared until you leave this earth."" For the past 14 years, he has been in a computer sales job at Ingram Micro. He married his college sweetheart. They have three kids and a nice house in the suburbs. He figured out early what others learn too late: Athletics is part of a journey, not the destination. Congratulations, Ray, you made it. In more ways than one."

Readybot can now be used to _ .	"What if you arrived home to find a delicious hot meal waiting for you, prepared by your own kitchen robot? It might sound like science fiction, but professors at the University of Tokyo have taken the first steps toward making that a reality. The team recently introduced a human-shaped kitchen robot that can pour tea and other drinks into cups and serve them to guests. When teatime is over, the robot can also wash the dishes and put them away. In California, another interesting kitchen robot has been developed, called Readybot. It can pick up objects and either store them in cabinets or put them in the trash. It also carries a separate floor-cleaning robot that can operate by itself. Unlike the Japanese robot, Readybot just looks more like a large box with arms and wheels. Readybot was created by engineers and designers who established a club called the Readybot Challenge. They believe that in the future millions of robots will be needed in homes to perform ordinary household tasks. Readybot is just the first step in their plan to create a robot that can do jobs not only in kitchens but in other rooms of homes and in offices as well. Clearly there are technological difficulties to solve before robots can cook a complete dinner, and there are also many safety concerns . Not everyone (especially parents) would be comfortable with the idea of robots in their house, _ hot pans and sharp knives. The European Commission recently funded a project to study these concerns. According to lead researcher Professor Chris Melhuish, ""Enabling robots to work safely with humans is a key need for the future development of robotics."""	['clean your kitchen']

What do you think of the differences between British and American people?	What do you think of British people and American people? You might think that there are no differences between the people in the two countries. After all they speak the same language, don't they? But if you ask a British or an American person, the differences are quite great. What do British people think Americans are like? The British think Americans are very strange. They make a lot of noise and they laugh too loudly. They are rich, and they only think about money. But the British do say that Americans are kind, friendly people. They are happy to help you if you are in trouble. What do Americans think of the British? Well, they think the British are cold and very unfriendly. They are not interested in success or in making lots of money. They think Britain is the best country in the world. They look down upon other countries. But Americans say that the British are quite good workers. They are brave and honest. And in time of trouble they face difficulties happily. You can see that these ideas can cause misunderstanding between the British and Americans. But when American and British people become friends, they usually find things are not as bad as they expected. ,:	['The differences are very great.']
According to the experiment, women spending two minutes working stairs for six weeks _ .	Young people frequently say that they want to exercise, but they just can't find the time. The solution just might be in-office interval training. Recent studies show that very short but intense exercise rapidly builds and maintains fitness and health, even when the workout is only a few minutes long. Work the stairs You can complete an excellent, effective -- and very brief -- workout in an office stairwell, says Martin Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada and an expert on interval training. For a study that he and his colleagues presented earlier this year, they asked 12 out-of-shape women in their 20s to warm up for two minutes by slowly walking up and down stairs in a campus office building. They completed three of these abbreviated stair workouts per week for six weeks. By the end, their aerobic fitness had improved substantially, the researchers reported, by about as much as if they had been running or cycling each week for hours. Fidget your way to fitness. Parents and teachers may once have urged you to sit still, but wiggling, tapping your toes, standing briefly, and otherwise fidgeting as much as possible at your desk is in fact good for your body. In one recent study, college students showed healthier blood flow in their lower legs if they fidgeted than if they did not. Even better, a 2008 study found that among office workers, those who frequently fidgeted burned as many as 300 calories more each day than those who resolutely stayed still.	['benefited a lot']
Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?	"Fed up with constantly having to recharge or replace batteries in your ever-expanding electronic devices? The solution may be just a few steps away. ""Energy harvesting"" promises to power countless consumer devices, often with nothing more than your body's movement or heat. Dozens of companies around the world already offer such products, but many experts believe the market for the technology could explode due to electronic devices being developed for the Internet of Things. ""It's huge,"" said Graham Martin, CEO of the EnOcean Alliance, a San Ramon-based group of businesses that promotes wireless energy-harvesting technologies. With the Internet of Things expected to combine billions of devices, ""if they are all battery-powered, we'll have a problem because there's not enough lithium in the world,"" he added. ""So a lot of them will have to use energy harvesting."" Among the most basic forms of the technology is body power. When certain materials are squeezed or stretched, the movement of their atoms creates an electrical charge. Automatic watches have employed the concept for decades, for example, by winding themselves when their user moves their arm. Now, the concept is being considered for a number of other devices. In a contest seeking visionary ideas for wearable technologies, Intel awarded $5,000 for a concept to change the temperature difference between a person's body and a special piece of clothing they'd wear into electricity for mobile devices. Using sound to power devices is another energy-harvesting variation. Stanford University engineers are testing smart microchips that create electricity from ultrasound to power implantable devices that can analyze a person's nervous system or treat their diseases. A textile research association in Spain is proposing to obtain electricity from radio waves that flow around everyone to power sensors sewn into clothes, which can monitor a person's heartbeat or other vital signs. Research firm IDTechEx has estimated that annual global sales of energy-harvesting products could hit $2.6 billion by 2024, while WinterGreen Research predicts sales of $4.2 billion by 2019. Obtaining stable energy from devices can be complex, however. For one thing, the motion that generates the electricity has to be constant to be useful. Moreover, the amount of power the devices produce depends on the person using them, according to a Columbia University study. It determined that taller people on average provide about 20 percent more power than shorter ones when walking, running or cycling. It's also unclear how eagerly consumers might welcome energy-harvesting products. While such devices are expected to cost less than battery-powered alternatives when compared over many years, experts say, people may continue buying ones with batteries merely because those would be cheaper in the short term."

What is the main idea behind life-long education?	"Life-long learning is the concept that ""It's never too soon or too late for learning."" -- a philosophy that has taken root in a larger number of different organizations. Life-long learning is an attitude -- learners believe that one can and should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors. Life-long learning throws the well-known rule ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks"" out of the door. Life-long learning provides the general public with learning opportunities at all ages and in different ways: at work, at home and through leisure activities, not just through formal channels such as school and higher education. Life-long education is often achieved through distance learning or e-learning, continuing education, home schooling, etc. It also includes training programs for those who want to improve their qualifications, bring their skills up to date or retrain for a new line of work. In later life, especially in retirement, continued learning takes various forms, crossing traditional academic limits. One of the reasons why life-long education has become so important is the rapid progress of modern science and technology. Although the period of primary, secondary and university education is increased, the knowledge and skills gained there are usually not _ for a professional career spanning three or four decades."

Scientists are still not sure about Kepler-78b _	For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds. The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away. Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars. While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

The professor was told to check in first because _ .	"""Before you fall in love, you'd better get a job"" As told by Lee Joon-ho, 20, a senior in law at Seoul National University Korean TV dramas have shown a lot of rebellious youth, but in fact most students still live a traditional life. Confucianism has a great influence on us. For instance, Confucius said that we should be dutiful to our parents and value the family. Thus we prefer a school that's close to home so we can go back every day. Also as a result of Confucianism, teachers enjoy a high status in Korea. The other day, my professor was flying to Vienna on a business trip. Instead of waiting for hours in the queue, he was told to check in first and didn't have any problem with overweight luggage. When it comes to important decision-making, such as choosing a university, a job, and a wife, we listen to our parents' suggestions. Most parents seem _ in study decisions, but they take a firmer attitude towards their children's love and marriage choices. Often, a man has to have his own business or a solid career before he's allowed to pursue romance. Male chauvinism is popular among our parents' generation, since they had to support the whole family through hard work. We need to shoulder the same responsibility, but we've also learned to respect women, as they're doing outstanding work in lots of areas. But to be honest, my friends and I still prefer a traditional woman as a girlfriend and future wife. We want her to be elegant and thoughtful in taking care of a family. Our sense of tradition is also reflected in our buying habits. In my house, you see only Korean appliances. Although European cell phones are available in ROK, we favor LG and Samsung, which are suited more to our tastes and widely promoted in TV dramas and films."	['People respect teachers in Korea.']
What is the main idea of the passage?	Nearly 60 million visitors flooded to the 384 national parks across America every year. And you won't have to wander far from home to enjoy one of these national treasures, with Michigan's Isle Royale National Park nearby. Located 56 miles from Copper Harbor on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the park remains _ that can only be reached by tour boat. With the exception of the Rock Harbor Lodge, which offers both rooms with private baths and accommodations in the form of small cottages, the 572,000 acres that make up the 45-mile-long park are rough, threaded with hiking paths that lead to tents-only campsites. You are likely to see a deer crossing mist-covered ponds in search of breakfast, gaze bald eagles flying overhead, or hear a beaver clapping its tail on the water. If you are especially lucky, you might even glimpse a grey wolf, nearly dying out from hunting on the mainland. Plenty of hiking paths open the area to exploration. The 4-mile Stroll Path winds through various trees and offers a tour of the island's history, including prehistoric Indian mines. The Jungle Path leads to Scoville Point----a perfect picnic spot surrounded on three sides by the shining waters of Lake Superior. You can also rent a boat at the park's service center and row down the shore to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse. Here park's service employees use nets to show how lake fishes used to be caught by the original local people. Their catch ends up on the dinner menu at the Rock Harbor Lodge. The park is open from mid-April through October; Rock Harbor Lodge is open from Memorial Day weekend until just after Labor Day.	['Attractions of the natural park.']
The birthday surprise is _ .	Jane always goes to school early. She likes to talk to her friends before class. After school she does not go home early. She is always late. Jane stops to see the animals in the pet shop. She likes to see the dogs. One of them is a little white dog. She watches the little dog play in the window of the shop. She watches for a long time, so she comes home late. One day her father and mother ask why she is late, and she tells them about the little dog in the pet shop. Jane is not late the next day. She stops to look in the window of the shop. But she doesn't see the dog, and she is very sad. She is also very happy, today is her birthday. Mother shows her a big birthday cake and Father gives her a birthday surprise . He gives her the little white dog from the shop. Jane is very happy. The next day Jane does not come home late. She runs home to play with the white dog.	['the little white dog']
What surprises the writer most?	I start to wonder what else had changed since I'd been gone. My parents are in an awkward puzzle, wondering how to treat me now----whether to treat me--still their daughter--as one of them, an adult, or as the child they feel they sent away months earlier. I run into two of my best friends from high school; we stare at each other, expressionless. We ask the simple questions and give simple answers. It's as if we have nothing to say to each other. I wonder how things have changed so much in such a small amount of time. We used to laugh and promise that no matter how far away we were, our love for each other would never change. Their interests don't interest me anymore, and I find myself unable to relate my life to theirs. I had been so excited to come home, but now I just look at it all and wonder: Is it me? Why hadn't the world stood still here while I was gone? My room isn't the same, my friends and I don't share the same promise, and my parents don't know how to treat me--or who I am, for that matter. I get back to school feeling half-satisfied, but not disappointed. I sit up in my bed in my dorm room, surrounded by my pictures, dolls. As I wonder what has happened, I realize that I can't expect the world to stand still and move forward at the same time. I can change and expect that things at home will stay the same. I have to find comfort in what has changed and what is new; keep the memories, but live in the present. A few weeks later, I'm packing again, this time for winter break. My mom meets me at the door. I have come home accepting the changes, not only in my surroundings, but most of all in me.	['The meeting with her best friends.']
The new models of artificial hearts are expected _ .	Just seven years ago, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart was being cheered as the model of human creativeness. The sight of Barney Clark----alive and conscious after trading his diseased heart for a metal-and-plastic pump----convinced the press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't. After monitoring production of the Jarvik-7, and reviewing its effects on the 150 or so patients (most of whom got the device as a temporary measure) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the machine was doing more to endanger lives than to save them. Last week the agency cancelled its earlier approval, effectively banning the device. The recall may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with the banned mode is that the tubes connecting it to an external power source created a passage for infection. Inventors are now working on new devices that would be fully placed, along with a tiny power pack, in the patient's chest. The first sample products aren't expected for another 10 or 20 years. But some people are already worrying that they'll work---and that America's overextended health-care programs will lose a precious $2.5 billion to $5 billion a year providing _ for a ly few dying patients. If such expenditures cut into funding for more basic care, the net effect could actually be a decline in the nation's health.	"[""to be set fully in the patient's chest""]"
Jessica's mother fell down into a faint because she was _ .	"""Mum, what does it mean when someone tells you that they have a skeleton in the closet ?"" Jessica asked. ""A skeleton in the closet?"" her mother paused thoughtfully.""Well, it's something that you would rather not have anyone else know about. For example, if in the past, someone in Dad's family had been arrested for stealing a horse, it would be 'a skeleton in his family's closet'. He really wouldn't want any neighbor to know about it."" ""Why pick on my family?"" Jessica's father said with anger. ""Your family history isn't so good, you know. Wasn't your great-great-grandfather a prisoner who was transported to Australia for his crimes?"" ""Yes, but people these days say that you are not a real Australian unless your ancestors arrived as prisoners."" ""Gosh, sorry I asked. I think I understand now,"" Jessica cut in before things grew worse. After dinner, the house was very quiet. Jessica's parents were still quite angry with each other. Her mother was ironing clothes and every now and then she glared at her husband, who hid behind his newspaper pretending to read. When she finished, she gathered the freshly pressed clothes in her arms and walked to Jessica's closet. Just as she opened the door and reached in to hang a skirt, a bony arm stuck out from the dark depths and a bundle of white bones fell to the floor. Jessica's mother sank in a faint , waking only when Jessica put a cold, wet cloth on her forehead. She looked up to see the worried faces of her husband and daughter. ""What happened? Where am I?"" she asked.""You just destroyed the school's skeleton, Mum,"" explained Jessica. ""I brought it home to help me with my health project. I meant to tell you, but it seemed that as soon as I mentioned skeletons and closets, it caused a problem between you and Dad."" Jessica looked in amazement as her parents began to laugh madly.""They're both crazy,""she thought."	['frightened']
Mathew Brady _ .	In 1826, a Frenchman named Niepce needed pictures for his business. But he was not a good artist. So he invented a very simple camera. He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden. That was the first photo. The next important date in the history of photography was in 1837.That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his reading-room. He used a new kind of camera in a different way. In his picture you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest thing. The kind of photo was called a Daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's way. Travellers brought back wonderful photos from all round the world. People took pictures of famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, photography was developed . Then photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. That was not simple. The photographers had to carry a lot of film and other machines. But this did not stop them, for example, some in the United States worked so hard.Mathew Brady was a famous American photographer. He took many pictures of great people. The pictures were unusual because they were very lifelike . Photographers also became one kind of art by the end of the 19th century. Some photos were not just taken of the real world, they showed ideas and feelings, like other kinds of art.	['was famous for his unusual pictures']
How did scientists find out the horses' earliest appearance millions of years ago?	"""Global warming could make humans shorter,"" warn scientists who claim to have found evidence that it caused the world's first horses to shrink nearly 50 million years ago. In fact, a team from the universities of Florida and Nebraska says it has found a link between the Earth heating up and the size of mammals - horses, in this case. The scientists used fossils to follow the evolution of horses from their earliest appearance 56 million years ago. As temperature went up,their size went down, and vice versa ;"" At one point they were as small as a house cat,"" said Dr Jonathan Bloch, curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History, which was quoted by the ""Daily Mail"" as saying. The scientists say that the current warming could have the same effect on mammals and could even make humans smaller.""Horses started out small, about the size of a small dog . What's surprising is that after they first appeared, they then became even smaller and then dramatically increased in size, and that exactly _ the global warming event, followed by cooling"" ""It had been known that mammals were small during that time and that it was warm, but we hadn't realized that temperature specifically was driving the evolution of body size,"" Dr Bloch said in the ""Science"" journal."

To be a friend,you must _ .	Too many people want others to be friends,but they don't give friendship back.That is why some friendships don't last long.To have a friend,you must learn to be one.You must learn to treat your friend the way you want your friend to treat you.Learning to be a good friend means learning three rules:be honest,be generous,be understanding. Honesty is where a good friend starts.Friends must be able to trust one another.If you do not tell the truth,people usually find out.If a friend finds out that you have't been honest,you may lose your friend's trust.Good friends always count on one another to speak and act honestly. Generosity means sharing and sharing makes a friendship grow.You do not have to give your lunch money or your clothes of course.Instead you have to learn how to share things you enjoy,like your hobbies and your interests.Naturally you will want to share your ideas and feelings.These can be very valuable to a friend.They tell your friend what is important to you. By sharing them,you help your friend know better. Sooner or later everyone needs understanding and help with a problem. Something may go wrong at school. Talking about the problem can make it easier to solve. Turning to a friend can be the first step in solving the problem. So a friend must listen and understand. You must try to put yourself in your friend's place so you can understand the problem better. No two friendships are ever exactly alike. But true friendships have three things in common. If you plan to keep your friends,you must practice honesty,generosity,and understanding.	['be honest,generous and understanding']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Do you know how to write an English letter? It is different from the Chinese letter. When we write a letter in English, we should write the date on the top of the right corner. Sometimes we write the _ ---the number of the house and the names of the street, city and country. Then we can begin the letter at the left corner. We always use words like ""Dear sir"", ""Dear Mr/Miss/Mrs ...""to begin the writing. At the end of the letter, we usually use expressions as ""Yours"", ""Yours ever"" or ""Yours sincerely"". Then sign the writer's name. It is also different to write an English envelope.

Modern tourism was born _ .	"Tourism probably started in Roman times. Rich Romans visited friends and family who were working in another part of the Roman Empire. But when the empire broke down,this kind of tourism stopped. In the early 17th century, the idea of the ""Grand Tour"" was born. Rich young English people sailed across the English Channel .They visited the most beautiful and important European cities of the time, including Paris in France, and Rome and Venice in Italy. Their tours lasted for two to four years, and the tourists stayed a few weeks or months in each city. The ""Grand Tour"" was an important part of young people's education--but only for the rich. In the 18th century, tourism began to change. For example, people in the UK started to visit some towns, such as Bath to"" take the waters"". They believed that the water there was good for their health. So large and expensive hotels were built in these towns. In the 19th century, travel became much more popular and faster. When the first railways were built in the 1820s, it was easier for people to travel between towns, so they started to go for holidays by the sea. And some started to have holidays in the countryside as cities became larger, noisier and dirtier. Traveling by sea also became faster and safer when the first steamships were built. People began to travel more to far away countries. The 20th century saw cars become more and more popular among ordinary people. Planes were made larger, so ticket prices dropped and more people used them. Thus tourism grew. In 1949, Russian journalist Vladimir Raitz started a company called Horizon Holidays. The company organizes everything--plane tickets, hotel rooms, even food--and tourists pay for it all before they leave home. The package tour and modern tourist industry was born. The first travel agency in China was set up as early as 1949.But tourism did not take off until 1978.In 2002,the industry was worth 500 billion yuan and became an important part of China's social development."

In the author's opinion, which of the following is the most likely to bring people true happiness?	"Too many people put off things that could bring them joy just because they haven't thought about them, don't have them on their schedules or are too stubborn to leave from their regular daily things. One day I thought about all those women on the Titanic who refused sweet foods at dinner that fateful night to cut out fatty foods. From then on, I've tried to be a little more changeable. I cannot count the times I called my sister and said, ""How about going to lunch in half an hour?"" She would stammer ,""I can't , I have clothes to wash. My hair is dirty. I wish I had known yesterday. I had a late breakfast. It looks like rain."" She died a few years ago. We never did have lunch together. We live on promises we make to ourselves when all the conditions are perfect. We'll go back and visit the grandparents when we get our baby, Stevie, toilet-trained. We'll enjoy when we replace the living room carpet. We'll go on a second honeymoon when we get two more kids out of college. Life has a way _ as we get older. The days get shorter, and the list of promises to ourselves gets longer. One morning, we wake up, and all we have to show for our lives is a long list of ""I'm going to"", ""I plan on"" and ""Someday, when things settle down a bit"". I love ice cream. But my lips had not touched ice cream in 10 years. The other day I stopped the car and bought an ice cream. If my car had hit an iceberg on the way home, I would have died happy. Now, go have a nice day. Do something you want to. If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you say? And why are you waiting?"

This passage mainly tells us that _ .	"Researchers Jose Cordova and Erich Astudillo have discovered a new molecule that kills the bacteria Streptococcus Mutans, long known to be responsible for breaking down sugars in food in the mouth, which damages tooth leading to decay . The new molecule they call ""Keep 32"" has been found to kill the bacteria. The two have applied for a patent on their discovery and have also begun a marketing strategy aimed at both oral care products and food products. They say either product, if left in the mouth for just 60 seconds ,will kill all the harmful bacteria in the mouth and keep _ at bay for several hours. If the new molecule passes health and safety tests, the two believe products using their new molecule should be on the market in as little as a year and a half. They expect the market for such a product to reach $300 million in just the first year. The two have been working together since 2005 using money from the Founder Institute and say the aim is to approve the process for creating the molecule they've discovered for big companies like Procter & Gamble, Colgate even candy companies such as Hershey's. In interviews, Astudillo has suggested that the two researchers are already heavily into discussion with several companies, some of which are interested in buying the patent once it is approved. Over the years many products have _ with announcement of reducing tooth decay and even the loss of teeth, but other than the introduction of fluoride into drinking water, not much progress has been made. If the announcement made by this new team proves true however, it could foresee a mark in saving the world of tooth decay as well as helping to improve the health for millions of people as tooth decay has been linked to many other health problems throughout the body including heart attacks."

.From the passage, it can be seen that the author _ .	"While still in its early stages, welfare reform has already been judged a great success in many states--at least in getting people off welfare.It's estimated that more than 2 million people have left the list since 1994. In the past four years, welfare list in Athens County have been cut in half.But 70 percent of the people who left in the past two years took jobs that paid less than $ 6 an hour.The result: The Athens County poverty rate still remains at more than 30 percent --twice the national average.For advocates for the poor, that's an indication that much more needs to be done. ""More people are getting jobs, but it's not making their lives any better,"" says Kathy Lairn, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington.A center analysis of US Census data nationwide found that between 1995 and 1996, a greater percentage of single, female-headed families were earning money on their own, but that average income for these families actually went down. But for many, the fact that poor people are able to support themselves almost as well without government aid as they did with it is in itself a huge victory.""Welfare was a poison.It was a poisonous substance that was poisoning the family,"" says Robert Rector, a welfare-reform policy analyst.""The reform is changing the moral climate in low-income communities.It's beginning to rebuild the work ethic , which is much more important."" Mr.Rector and others argued that once ""the habit of dependency is cracked,"" then the country can make other policy changes aimed at improving living standards."

PM Lee holds that the students should _ .	"Speaking in his first National Day Rally speech on 15 August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien said Singapore's education system was set for more reforms in the years ahead, particularly for the primary and secondary education.Read the summary of his thoughts on education below. For a start, the Government is prepared to send and additional 3,000 teachers to Singapore schools, cut the courses of study even further and change the way the mother tongue, especially Chinese, is taught.But, for the changes to be successful, parents need to help. Singapore has a devoted group of teachers and principals and quite a few of them are outstanding, but the Republic's schools can be even better.To help the schools make a jump in quality, the Government plans that within the next 6 years, it will send 1,000 more teachers to primary schools, 1,400 to secondary schools and 550 more to junior colleges.Each school would decide how to use its extra teachers.Some may want to make classes smaller so students get more individual attentions while others may have new teachers assist more senior teachers, but the overall goal is to give teachers the time and space to come up with ways to bring out the best in their students. More teachers must not mean more homework, however.In fact, the Prime Minister wants to see the courses cut down so that there is less pressure on the students.Good grades are important but they should not be the only goal students have.PM Lee is convinced that ""we must teach less so that our children can learn more."" Another change will be in the teaching of the mother tongue so that students can become more fluent.The key is to teach Chinese as a living language not just an academic subject like Latin.Therefore, the focus should be on speaking and reading the language.To do this, there must be an environment outside the classroom that is contributing to strengthening the Chinese lessons."

From the passage, what is the relationship between Goneril and Regan?	Part 3 NARRATOR: As soon as Goneril has got all she can from her father, she begins treating _ disrespectfully. When Lear wants to speak to her, Goneril tells her servant, Oswald, to say she is sick. She encourages her staff to be disrespectful towards Lear and begins complaining about the hundred soldiers Lear has brought with him. However, King Lear soon has a friend by his side. The Duke of Kent, who Lear ordered to leave Britain, cannot abandon his king. He therefore comes to Lear disguised as a servant called Caius and asks for a job. (Enter Lear, several of Lear's soldiers and Kent disguised as a servant.) LEAR: OK, Caius. I'll give you a trial. And if you prove to be good at your job, I'll keep you on as my servant. (Oswald enters.) Hey, you there. Where's my daughter? (Oswald ignores the king and hurries out of the room.) Hey. What's going on? Call him back. Is he deaf? (A Soldier rushes out after Oswald.) It's as though the whole world has gone to sleep. (Soldier reenters.) Where's that servant? Why didn't he come back when I called? SOLDIER: Sir, he answered me very rudely and said he would not come back. LEAR: I don't believe it! SOLDIER: Sir, I am sorry, to tell you this, but it seems to me that you are not being treated with the respect due to a king. Everyone here, including your daughter, is behaving very coldly towards you. LEAR: Mmm. I suspected the same, but I kept telling myself it was my imagination. Please tell my daughter I wish to speak with her. (Soldier bows and leaves. Oswald enters.) Ah, come here my man and answer me. Who am I? OSWALD: My lady's father. LEAR: Your lady's father? Is that all I am to you, you dog, you slave! (Lear raises his arm as though to strike Oswald.) OSWALD: I'll not be hit, my Lord. KENT: (Kent kicks Oswald's feet out from under him.) And you won't be laid flat on your back either, I suppose. Now get up and get out of here. (Oswald leaves.) LEAR: My thanks, Caius. I can see you will be a most valuable servant. (Enter Goneril.) What's up, daughter? You always seem to be frowning lately. GONERIL: Is it any wonder that I frown when your soldiers are continually drinking and fighting? I thought when I told you about their behavior you would make them behave, but now I hear you have insulted Oswald. I do believe you are encouraging your soldiers in their bad behavior. LEAR: Is this my daughter scolding me? GONERIL: I have had enough of your soldiers. They are expensive to keep and you don't need them. Besides, their drunken behavior and bad manners are disgusting. You will send half of them away. And unless you want me to get rid of the rest of them too, I suggest you teach them how to behave properly. LEAR: That's a lie. My soldiers are good men who know how to behave properly. I won't stay here to be insulted. I still have one more daughter. She'll scratch out your eyes when she hears how you've treated me. Men! Get my horses ready and collect my baggage. I'll leave immediately. I won't stay where I'm not welcome. (Lear and companions leave.) NARRATOR: Lear sends Kent on ahead to the castle of his other daughter, Regan, to tell her that he will soon be arriving. Goneril sends her servant Oswald to Regan to tell her side of the story.

Which country has the largest population in the world?	China is a great country with the largest population in the world.In order to solve the population problem,our governmentcarried outone-child policy before.When it is carried out for some time,many people not only see its advantages but also disadvantages. From 2016,two-child policy is put into effect.In my opinion,two-child policy is good.First of all,two-child policy is the gift for some only child.For some families,maybe the parents are only child and they also can have only child.Besides the loneliness of their child,when their child grows up and they grow older,their child marry an only child girl,the burden on their child and his wife is too heavy.Their child and his wife have to take care of two couples.Usually,a young couple looking after an old couple is a little difficult.But if their parents have two children,they can share the burden of taking care of their parents.It would be much better.Secondly,two-child policy can guarantee the number of Chinese population. All in all,one-child policy has been out of date.And two-child policy is needed and necessary.It can solve the problems of nowadays and the future.	['China.']
Before Jessie mowed the lawn, she. _ .	"Jessie felt her life so boring one summer day. She was tired of watching TV, she read all her books, and her friends were on vacation. She wanted something different to do. Suddenly, she saw the lawn mower sitting in the yard. ""Mom,"" she shouted, ''I think I will mow the lawn."" Her mom ran into the yard and said,""Oh no, you don't. You're too young to mow the lawn."" ""I'm fourteen years old and know how to do it,"" Jessie said. ""Besides, it would help Dad out, and he won't have to worry about it over the weekend."" Mom thought for a while and then decided to let Jessie give it a try. After all, she was home and would _ her. Jessie already knew how to start the lawn mower from watching her dad. Jessie checked the gas to make sure it was full, and put on her gardening gloves to protect her hands. Mom watched from the kitchen window. Jessie really does know how to mow the lawn. She was very careful around the flowers and trees. When she finished, she felt so good, but she was so hot. Mom brought her some ice tea and said, ""You really did a great job. Dad will be very surprised."" Later that day, Dad came home and said to Jessie's mom, ""You didn't have to mow the lawn. I was going to do it on Saturday. It looks great. Thanks."" ""I didn't mow it. Jessie did."" ""Wow, our little girl is growing up!"" Dad told Jessie what a great job she had done. ""It was fun, and I will do it again next week,"" said Jessie.

Where does this text probably come from?	"This week Faith Lapidus and Doug Johnson will tell you about Chuck Berry.Chuck Berry,born on October 18,1926,is often called the father of rock and roll.He is one of the most popular and influential performers of rhythm-and-blues and rock'n'roll music during the 1950s,1960s and 1970s. He started singing in church when he was six years old.His interest in music stuck with him.A lot of Chuck Berry's material is about teenage life,especially school.Chuck Berry left school when he was 17.He headed west with two friends,but they did not get far.They were arrested after they used a gun to steal a car in Kansas City,Missouri.He was set free after four years.

From the passage, we can conclude that _ .	When building houses, people used to think about not only the climate of the areas but also the building materials and the fashions for their houses. However, since electricity became more and more expensive , people began to pay much more attention to the energy they could get for their houses and the new ways they could find to protect their houses from both cold and heat. Now, houses of an old yet new type have been widely built. In some parts of the world, people share their houses with their _ . During cold weather, they gather their cows, goats, or other animals and keep them on the first floor of their houses. The reasons are that the animals can be protected from the cold and that they can help to heat the houses as well. The body heat given off by the animals rises to the second floor of the houses, where people live. By sharing their houses with their livestock, people gain a source of heat. People who live in or near cities do not usually keep livestock. However, home builders use the fact that heat rises. This _ can be used in building houses in these areas, instead of keeping livestock on the first floor builders fill it with large rocks. As they are open to the sun's rays during cold weather, these rocks take in heat. They also give off the heat, and, of course, the warm air rises into the living areas of the houses. So these houses are energy saving. House building becomes a great challenge to building designers and energy engineer. They try to meet this challenge by learning from old traditions and by using modern technology. And someday in the future, people will be able to live in more energy saving houses.

When Mr. and Mrs. Bell got to the airport. _	Mr. And Mrs. Bell are very forgetful . For example , Mr. Bell sometimes goes to his office for work on Sunday morning, for he thinks it is Monday. And Mrs. Bell sometimes forget to cook supper for the family. One summer they planned to fly to New York for their holidays. They got to the airport only ten minutes before the plane took off. So time was short. But suddenly Mrs. Bell said she must tell Alice, their daughter, not to forget to lock the front door when she went to school. As Alice was then at school, they couldn't tell her about it by telephone. So they hurried to the post office. Mrs. Bell wrote a short note to Alice while Mr. Bell bought a stamp and an envelope . Soon the note was ready. They put the stamp on the envelope in a hurry and dropped it in the letter box, but suddenly Mrs. Bell began to cry. The short note was still in her hand. She had put the plane ticket in the envelope.	['the plane would take off in ten minutes']
Which of the following about Doctor Ysisuf's experiment on Polycap in India is True?	Studies have shown that the fewer medicines a person has to take the more likely he or she will take them. Last week, a study was released about a new treatment that combines 5 medicines for heart disease in one pill. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was the lead investigator. He presented the findings at the American College of Cardiology Conference in Orlando, Florida. The experimental drug is known as Polycap. It contains aspirin, a drug to lower cholesterol and three medicines to lower blood pressure. The study was carried out at 50 health centers across India. More than two thousand people between the ages of 45 and 80 took part in the study. All had at least one risk factor for heart disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or being severely overweight. The people were divided into 9 groups of about 200 people each. One group took Polycap. The other groups took either a single drug or different combinations of the medicines in the Polycap pill. The study showed that Polycap lowered blood pressure and cholesterol without many side effects. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill, taken once a day, could reduce the average person's risk of heart disease and stroke by about half. The maker of Polycap, Cadila Pharmaceuticals of India, paid for the study. Cardiovascular diseases of the heart and blood vessels are the number one cause of death around the world. These diseases kill more than seventeen million people every year. 80 percent of them are in low and middle income countries. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill treatment could revolutionize heart disease prevention. People would be more likely to take one pill a day than many pills. And one pill would cost less than several pills. Other heart doctors say heart disease prevention is important but not necessarily with pills. They say patients might be able to get the same results with changes in diet and exercise. Doctors say that more research on Polycap is needed. They say the drug should be tested on thousands more people, including those in different risk, age and ethnic groups.	['Polycap was proved basically safe and effective.']

What would be the best title for this passage?	It would be hard to find a person in America who has never eaten a hamburger, but this popular food was not originally made in America. The original hamburger can be traded back to the Middle Ages, when Russians ate raw meat that was scraped and shredded with a dull knife and formed into patties , It was called Tartar steak. This was the first step in a long series of developments that eventually resulted in hamburger as we know it today. German sailors picked up the raw meat delicacy in their contacts with Russians and brought it back to their home port of Hamburg. But the people there were unused to eating raw meat , so they broiled the outside of the Russian steak; thus the hamburger steak was born. The hamburger steak was brought ot America in the nineteenth century immigrants. Louis Lasssen, a cook in New Haven, Connecticut, modified the hamburger steak by sandwiching it between two pieces of bread. But the true American hamburger came into existence in St. Louis at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. A harried cook at the fair quickly slapped broiled beef patties between buns and served them to a demanding crowd, which gulped them down joyously. At first this new food creation was made from scraps of poorer cuts of meat that were not used for anything else, but before scrapes were not enough. The demand for greater quantities of hamburger could only be met by using more and better cuts . Hamburger stands sprang up all over the country, and a side industry of condiments , such as ketchup and relish, grew	['The Development of the Hamburger']
From the passage, we know _ .	"Throughout time, people have loved music for its ability to transport them into a world of rhythm and melody. Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . After each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. Therapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . Music therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. Jose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. ""I was searching for my pain."" He says of his experience, ""but it was gone."" While Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. In addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. Even perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal. Drum circles attract people who find stress relief in beating out rhythms. While music is not a cure-all, it does make life a little easier."	['Garcia found much comfort in music according to his mom']
"In this passage ""early birds"" means ""persons who _ """	"Expert say that students usually need eight to ten hours' sleep at night, but most Chinese students do not get enough sleep.

Like thousands of students "" early birds"" in China, he has to get up before six every morning. A report shows that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker than they should be. Many students have fallen asleep during class at one time or another. Too much homework is not the only reason why students stay up late. Some watch TV or play the computer games late into the night. Experts have ever said that the students should develop good study habits. So some clever students never study last, they are able to work well in class."	['get up early']
"The phrase ""the blood of Aesop"" probably means "" _ ""."	"Nobody knows for certainty all the details of the life of Aesop. However, scholars have been working to established some facts and this is the brief story of Aesop as it is accepted today. Aesop was born a slave around the year 620 B.C. InAncient Greece, it was a privilege and tradition of freedmen to be interested in public affairs, so Aesop worked hard to raise himself from a servile slave's position to a high position of renown. He was a thinker and philosopher and eventually became widely admired. Aesop was a smart man and a good speaker. He liked to learn and to also teach people, so he traveled through many countries. He came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king Croesus of Lydia who was a patron of learning and learned men. Croesus was so impressed by Aesop that he invited Aesop to permanently reside at Sardis. The king hired Aesop to do diplomatic government work such as trying to establish peace between the various republics of Greece. Aesop reconciled the inhabitants of these cities by telling his wise fables. It was on one of these ambassadorial missions that Aesop was killed. Croesus had sent him to Delphi with lots of gold which was to be distributed among the citizens. After talking with the people of Delphi, Aesop got so mad at the citizens because of their covetousness. He refused to divide the money and instead sent it back to his master. The Delphians were so mad they executed Aesop as a public criminal. As it often happens in Greek history, the Delphians were visited by a series of calamities as a sort of retribution for Aesop's death. This is where the phrase ""the blood of Aesop"" originated. The saying means ""wrongful deeds will not go unpunished"". In memory of Aesop, a statue was erected in Athens. The statue was created by the famous Greek sculptor, Lysippus."

Which of the following words can best decribe the author's father?	"On Sundays my father always wore that dull gray apron - the one with the race cars all over it. The ritual began after breakfast when Dad always announced: ""Go ahead everyone. I'll take care of the dishes!"" With that my mother disappeared into the folds of the Sunday paper. Off came the suit coat he had worn to church that morning. Up went the shirtsleeves. On went that apron. For the next hour Dad did the dishes, singing ballads like ""I Had a Hat When I Came In"" and ""Who Put the Chow in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?"" I suppose it was strange for a boy's father to wear an apron - even one with race cars - but I never thought much of it until the day that Dad broke with tradition. It was the last Sunday in August. My father seemed in an expansive mood as we walked home from church together. ""Tommy,"" he said letting my name roll off his tongue. My mind raced ahead of his words: The birds and the bees? A new bike? A part-time job? ""There comes a time in every boy's life when he must take on responsibilities."" This was important. I might even get to back the car out of the driveway. ""Responsibilities?"" I asked. ""Yes. It's time you took a greater role in the household."" Power tools? Boss my baby brother? ""Starting today, I want you to do the dishes on Sunday morning so your mother and I can work the crossword puzzle together."" ""The dishes!?"" ""Anything wrong with taking over the dishes, son?"" I started to say something about a man's job or woman's work, but I knew immediately that my protests would fall on deaf ears. I didn't taste a bit of breakfast that morning. Dad seemed in a jovial mood as he described an exceptional Yankee game seen through the eyes of Mel Allen on the radio last night. ""Mickey Mantle drove the ball right over the center field wall,"" he said. ""Just a straight line climb in right out of the stadium."" He looked out the window as if trying to pick the ball out of the cloud formations. I tried to imagine Mickey Mantle wearing an apron. Suddenly, everything grew quiet. My sister began to clear the table. My brother was scraping the last of the egg from his plate. And then that ancient family ritual that had filled so many Sunday mornings came to an end. My father announced: ""Let's go read the paper, Hon."" ""Aren't you doing the dishes?"" my mother asked in puzzlement. ""Your oldest son has generously offered to fill the position."" My brother and sister stopped cold. So this was what my life had come to. A dark angel sat on my left shoulder and reminded me that I could hit a baseball farther than anyone in my class. I could bench-press my weight. I knew three declensions in Latin, the language of Caesar. Ask me to run through a rainstorm. Command me to ride the roller coaster - backward. These things I would do. But I could never do those dishes. There was nothing left but to refuse. People often say there is a special chemistry between a father and a son. He came back into the kitchen just as I was about to storm out. He had loosened his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt - ready to relax. In his right hand was the old apron. ""I want you to have this, Tommy. It'll keep your clothes from getting wet."" And before I could mount a protest, he had put the thing on me. ""Thanks, Son. Your mother and I appreciate this."" With that he disappeared into the Sunday paper. I looked down at the plastic. It had seen better days. I could see my dad reaching for the dishes. The dark angel flew off. Soon I was singing about Mrs. Murphy's chowder. The words came out of nowhere. And out of nowhere I knew the kind of man I wanted to be."	['responsible']
The study leads us to believe that _ .	"Would you eat a ready meal from the fridge rather than cook by yourself? Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do? A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, ""People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too."" ""If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks."" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%. The results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year."

"In this passage , the author seems to feel _ the Americans' ""sorry""."	"There is one word that is on the lips of Americans , day and night , ""Sorry"". One time as I was walking on the street , a young man ran by hurriedly , brushing against my handbag . Even as he continued on his way , he turned back and said ""sorry"" to me . Even in a rush , he didn't forget to apologize . One day , after I bought some apples , the salesman was giving me the change , but I wasn't ready for it , and a coin dropped on the ground, ""I'm sorry ,"" he said while bending down to pick it up . I was puzzled --why would he apologize when it was my fault ? Another time , I stepped on a man's foot in an escalator . At the same time , we both said ""sorry"" . I thought it interesting : was it really necessary for him apologize ? Later on , an American friend explained to me that according to the American ideas, the escalator is public place which everyone should be able to stand in . After someone occupies a position in the escalator , making it difficult for someone else to find a place to stand in , isn't it necessary to express an apology ? During my stay in America , I gradually realized that when friction occurs in daily life , Americans don't care much about who is responsible . If someone is troubled , a ""sorry"" is always necessary . Even if the other person is hurt , the ""sorry"" would cool tempers . Perhaps this is why I never saw anyone quarreling on the buses , subways or streets in America ."	['approving of']
What is the best title for the passage?	Runners in a relay race pass a stick in one direction.However,merchants passed silk,gold, fruit,and g1ass along the Silk Road in more than one direction.They earned their living by traveling the famous Silk Road. The Silk Road was not a simple trading network. It passed through thousands of cities and towns. It started from eastern China, across Central Asia and the Middle East, and ended in the Mediterranean Sea. It was used from about 200 B.C. to about A.D.1300, when sea travel offered new routes . It was sometimes called the world's longest highway. However, the Silk Road was made up of many routes, not one smooth path. They passed through what are now 18 countries. The routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun, deep snow and even battles. Only experienced traders could return safe. The Silk Road got its name from its most prized product. Silk could be used like money to pay taxes or buy goods. But the traders carried more than just silk. Gold, silver, and glass from Europe were much found in the Middle East and Asia. Horses traded from other areas changed farming practices in China. Indian merchants traded salt and other valuable goods. Chinese merchants traded paper, which produced an immediate effect on the West. Apples traveled from centre Asia to Rome. The Chinese had learned to graft different trees together to make new kinds of fruit. They passed this science on to others, including the Romans. The Romans used grafting to grow the apple. Trading along the Silk Road led to world-wide business 2,000 years before the World Wide Web. The People along the Silk Road did not share just goods. They also shared their beliefs.The silk Road provided pathways for learning,diplomacy ,and religion.*	['The Silk Road:East Meets West']
Which is WRONG according to the passage?	"We have dreams almost every night. Do you ever notice the colors of your dreams? Do you dream in black and white or do you dream in yellow, red and green? New research suggests that the type of television you watched as a child has a great effect on the color of your dreams. While almost all people under 25 dream in color, thousands of people over 55, all of whom were brought up with black and white TV sets, often dream in monochrome . ""It suggests there could be a critical period in our childhood when watching films has a big impact on the way dreams are formed"", said Eva Murzyn, a psychology student at Dundee University in Britain who carried out the study. Research from 1915 through the 1950s suggested that the vast majority of dreams are in black and white. But the tide turned in the sixties, and later results suggested that up to 83 percent of dreams contain some color. Since this period also marked the transition between black-and-white film and TV and Technicolor ,an obvious explanation was that the media had been painting people's dreams. However, there weren't any firm conclusions. But now Miss Murzyn believes she has proven the link. She made a survey of more than 60 people, half of whom were over 55 and half of whom were under 25. She asked the volunteers to answer a questionnaire on the color of their dreams and their childhood exposure to film and TV. She then analyzed her own data. Only 4.4 percent of the under-25s' dreams were black and white. The over-55s who had had access to color TV and film during their childhood also reported a very low proportion of just 7.3 percent. But the over-55s who only had access to black-and -white media reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time. Even though they would have spent only a few hours a day watching TV or films, their attention and emotion would have been heightened during this time, leaving a deeper imprint on their mind, Miss Murzyn told the New Scientist. ""The crucial time is between three and ten when we all begin to have the ability to dream"", she said."	['Eva Murzyn is a professor at Dundee University in Britain.']

What can we learn about the woman living in the A-frame house?	"Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, ""Mother, you must come to see the daffodils before they are over.""

The Italians regarded Hawkwood as a sort of hero _ .	"There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for ""protection"". If the money was not paid immediately, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop. Getting ""protection money"" is not a modern means. As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters. Then Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a group of soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to those who were willing to pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money with this method. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero .When he died at eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had his picture painted, which was in memory of ""this bravest man""."

Mary left Pennsylvania for Europe at age 20 mainly because _ .	"Mary Cassatt is one of the first great women American painters. At first her father did not want her to become an artist. But she followed her dreams and became an artist.She was born on May 22, 1844, and lived in Europe for several years as a child. Her family returned to the United States and, at age 16, Mary attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Four years later she decided she couldn't learn anything fresh and practical in Philadelphia, so she returned to Europe. There she studied the skills of the masters in Rome, Seville, Antwerp, and Paris. Mary received the chance of a lifetime at the age of 33 when the famous French painter, Edgar Degas, asked her to join a group of painters that included now-famous artists like Manet and Renoir. Their style of painting is called Impressionism. They used primary colors and short brush strokes in their work. They recognized Mary 's spirit and powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows. Mary painted what she saw: gardens, and paintings of persons , especially of mothers and children involved in everyday living. One of her paintings, ""Young Mother and Two Children,"" was given to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today. Mary never married and, in 1877, her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her. Mary devoted much of her time to them for the next 18 years to their care. Mary painted until 1914 when her failing eyesight made it impossible to continue. She spent the later years of her life in Paris. She died in 1926 at the age of 82. Unfortunately,all her life, she refused to accept students."	"[""her desire for the learning wasn't satisfied well""]"
About 40 percent of passwords are easily stolen because the users often do _ things.	"Better think twice before choosing a password for e-mail, online bank or shopping. Simple passwords are easy to be stolen . A password is like a key to your home. If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16 percent took a first name as a password. Another 14 percent used the easiest keyboard combinations such as 12345678 or QWERTY. 5 percent of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3 percent of the passwords expressed feelings like ""I don't care"", ""whatever"", ""I love you"", or their opposite , ""I hate you"". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol . Of course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the best password is easy for you and hard for others."	['easy']
The passage is most probably intended for _ .	"The term ""resume"" means a document describing one's educational qualifications and professional experience. However, guidelines for preparing a global resume are constantly changing. The best advice is to find out what is appropriate regarding the company culture, the country culture, and the culture of the person making the hiring decision. The following list is a good place to start. *In many countries, it is standard procedure to attach a photo or have your photo printed on your resume. Do not attach a photograph to your resume if you are sending it to the United States, though. *Educational requirements differ from country to country. In most cases of ""cross-border"" job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not be enough. Provide the reader with details about your studies and any related experience. *Pay attention to the resume format you use--chronological or reverse-chronological order. If you find no specific guidelines, the general preference is for the reverse-chronological format, which means listing your current or most recent experience first. *The level of computer technology and accessibility to the Internet varies from country to country. Even if a company or individual lists an e-mail address, there is no guarantee that they will actually receive your email. Send a paper copy of your resume, as well as the emailed copy, just to make sure that it is received. *If you are writing your resume in English, find out if the receiver uses British English or American English because there are variations between the two versions. *Although English is widely accepted today as being the universal language of business, most multinational companies will expect you to speak the language of one of the countries in which they do business, in addition to English. Have your resume prepared in both languages, and be ready for your interview to be conducted in both languages. Most companies will want to see and hear proof of your language skills. *Be aware that paper sizes are different in different countries. The United States standard is 81/2 by 11 inches, while the European A4 standard is 21 by 29.7 centimeters. When you send your resume by email, reformat it to the receiver's standard. Otherwise, when it is printed out, half of your material may be missing!"	['job hunters that seek careers abroad']
The new material is especially useful in areas that _ .	"Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new material that can move heat out of buildings and into space. The researchers say the material can cool buildings even on hot days. The cooling material is a very thin sheet with many layers that could be placed on a roof like solar panels . However, instead of turning sunlight into energy as solar panels do, the material turns heat into radiation. Shanhui Fan is an electrical engineering professor at Stanford University. He says that the panels have a layer of material that is like sand. The panels act like a mirror. They take heat out of buildings and reflect the light from the sun. And he says both the heat and sunlight are sent 100 kilometers into outer space. ""It's a structure that cools itself without electricity input, even under the sun. So, what it does is basically radiate heat to outer space and also reflect the sunlight so it doesn't get heated up by the sun. Mr. Fan says it is like having a window into space. The heat is sent directly into space without warming the air."" He says buildings in developing countries that do not have electricity or air conditioning could use the panels. ""In areas where electricity is out of reach for many people, there is a potential benefit for storing medicine or even food. In many of these situations, being able to reduce the temperature is important. And this would provide a way to do it."" The researchers say the main problem is creating actual cooling systems using the high-tech panels. They say it may be possible to develop a cooling spray that could be used on present solid structures. They believe the cooling spray technology could be developed in the next three to five years. They say as much as 15 percent of the energy used in the United States is spent providing power to air conditioning systems."	['are short of power']
What can we infer from the passage?	Nearly 60 million visitors flooded to the 384 national parks across America every year. And you won't have to wander far from home to enjoy one of these national treasures, with Michigan's Isle Royale National Park nearby. Located 56 miles from Copper Harbor on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the park remains _ that can only be reached by tour boat. With the exception of the Rock Harbor Lodge, which offers both rooms with private baths and accommodations in the form of small cottages, the 572,000 acres that make up the 45-mile-long park are rough, threaded with hiking paths that lead to tents-only campsites. You are likely to see a deer crossing mist-covered ponds in search of breakfast, gaze bald eagles flying overhead, or hear a beaver clapping its tail on the water. If you are especially lucky, you might even glimpse a grey wolf, nearly dying out from hunting on the mainland. Plenty of hiking paths open the area to exploration. The 4-mile Stroll Path winds through various trees and offers a tour of the island's history, including prehistoric Indian mines. The Jungle Path leads to Scoville Point----a perfect picnic spot surrounded on three sides by the shining waters of Lake Superior. You can also rent a boat at the park's service center and row down the shore to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse. Here park's service employees use nets to show how lake fishes used to be caught by the original local people. Their catch ends up on the dinner menu at the Rock Harbor Lodge. The park is open from mid-April through October; Rock Harbor Lodge is open from Memorial Day weekend until just after Labor Day.	['The number of grey wolves is smaller than that of deer.']
"How to understand the sentence ""There was a chance in a million that she might be right.""?"	A German taxi-driver, Franz Bussman, recently found his brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years ago. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman said that the workman was closely like her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz laughed at the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busman knew this story quite well, she thought there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman. And he really was Franz's long-lost brother. When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. After having been wondered towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit . The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his home, but the house had been bombed up. Guessing that his family had all been killed during an air-raid , Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.

The drone is driven away when its job is finished, because _ .	Honeybees Honeybees can do three kinds of jobs. It is one of the most unusual insects in the world. Bees are special because they divide up their honeybee work. Each bee has a certain job to do. The busiest bee is the worker. Workers build the nest, called a hive. Inside the hive, workers make a honeycomb from wax . They store honey there for food. Workers are always cleaning and fixing the hive. They even stand at the opening and fan their wings to cool the hive. Worker bees will attack anything--even people--to keep their hive safe. Another kind of bee is the drone . Drones are male bees, and their job is to fly with the queen bee and mate with her. After the queen mates, the worker bees drive the drones away. The drones then starve to death. The third kind of bee is the queen. Each hive needs only one queen, and her job is laying eggs. She can lay as many as 2, 000 eggs a day.	['it is no longer needed in the hive']
How does the writer like what he saw in Shanghai that day?	"""Why does the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!"" That's an old joke in the west, but it came to my mind again when I saw people crossing the road at the _ of Shanxi Road and Huaihai Road in Shanghai. When the traffic light was red, a group of people were waiting for the light to change. Suddenly one man began rushing to the other side of the road. Soon others followed him at the crossing and more people did the same. Just like chickens, they didn't mind the honking horns and kept crossing the road in a mess. Every year several thousand people are either killed or hurt on the roads in Shanghai. And at least one third of them were jaywalking . Jaywalking is very common in Shanghai. It seems that jaywalkers are not afraid of the danger to themselves. Traffic laws are to keep people safe. So we should obey them, and have good road-crossing habits. When someone starts to jaywalk, we should stop him, and never follow him. That way we can avoid the traffic accidents."	"[""He thinks it's wrong.""]"
Samaranch was born _ .	Within IOC, Samaranch was a man much admired and sometimes loved, the Spanish who made the organization into one that is rich and so powerful. No one doubted Samaranch's ability to make something impossible come true. In 1981 he ensured that Seoul was elected to be the host of the 1988 Olympics. Remember, that was a time when the two Koreas were at war with each other. And because Samaranch helped swing Spanish votes across to London, rather than to Paris, London was made host for the 2012. To China and the Chinese people, Samaranch was considered a great friend. Thanks to his efforts during his last term as IOC president, Beijing and China won the Olympics for the first time. Samaranch led the IOC from 1980 to 2001. Certainly, throughout his IOC presidential term, he had a soft spot for Moscow, for it was there that he was elected president of the IOC in 1980, and it was there that he managed to reach his final wishes as IOC president. Very early on in that 2001 Moscow session he wanted the Belgian surgeon, Jacques Rogge, a newcomer to the Olympic Movement, to replace him as president, for China to host the 2008 Olympic Games and for his son, Juan Antonio Samaranch junior, to become an IOC member. He got all three wishes. Samaranch's death came three months before his 90th birthday on April 21st, 2010.	['in July, 1920']

The whale's explosion is the result of _ .	"Question: What is more astonishing than a 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck being driven down the street? Answer: A 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck exploding and raining blubber ( fat of whales) all over the sidewalk. That's what happened in Taiwan recently, when a dead sperm whale being shipped to the Halobios Research Center for an autopsy developed an extremely bad case of gas and blew up before it reached its destination. The whale was found alive on a prefix = st1 /Taiwanbeach last weekend, and died shortly after it was discovered. Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose. Obviously, too much time passed between when the animal died and the time it was set to be moved to the autopsy location, because it had already started to go bad. When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly. The pressure inside the rotting creature grew so much that it popped like an over-filled balloon. Unfortunately, it was on a truck in the middle of the city of Taiwanat the time--- cars and shops lining the street were covered with whale bits and juices, much to their owners' discouragement. According to the news reports, traffic was tied up for hours while officials tried to clean up the streets. Newspaper editors worldwide were probably smiling to themselves, since they had a ready-made headline--- several reports about the incident were titled "" There She Blows!"" after the famous line from the book Moby Dick."

What do most college students fail to realize?	"Celia was shocked. She had always been in good shape during high school, but now, in her first year of college, she was suddenly ten pounds heavier. ""My friends and I often had pizza or ice cream when we studied late at night,"" she said, ""and I was always drinking Coke to stay awake."" Celia's experience is common. Many students enter college and find it so different that they cannot deal with changes properly. They're away from their parents and in a new stressful environment. Pressures together with freedom to sleep and eat however they please cause many students to experience the ""Freshman 15"": gaining weight suddenly in their freshman year of college. Most students do not realize that the ""Freshman 15"" can cause some serious health problems. Of course, college-age adults are still developing bone mass, so gaining some weight is normal. Sudden weight gain, however, puts too much strain on the heart and lungs, resulting in little energy and some difficulty thinking and remembering. In later life, it can lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and possibly cancer. The solution to the ""Freshman 15"" is simple--pay attention to developing good habits! In general: * Eat normal-sized meals at regular times. Eat slowly and enjoy it, so you don't need to go back for more. * Keep only healthy snacks in your room--and don't snack too often! * Control drinking and smoking. Alcohol has a lot of calories, and smoking too much makes exercise difficult. * Exercise regularly! Even just 30 minutes a day--such as walking quickly to class from your dorm--will make a big difference!"	['Sudden weight gain may lead to serious health problems.']
How did the writer feel about tricycles?	"The bicycling craze came in when we were just about at the right age to enjoy it.At first even ""safety"" bicycles were too dangerous and improper for ladies to ride, and they had to have tricycles.My mother had(I believe)the first female tricycle in Cambridge;and l had a little one,and we used to go out for family rides,all together;my father in front on a bicycle. and my poor brather Charles standing miserable on the bar behind lny mother.I found it very hard work.pounding away on my hard tyres;a glorious,but not a pleasurable pastinle. Then, one day at lunch, my father said he had just seen a new kind of tyre,filled up,with air,and he thought it might be a success.And soon after that everyone had bicycles,ladies and all; and bicycling became the smart thing,and the lords and ladies had their pictures in the papers,riding along in the park,in straw hats. My mother must have fallen off her bicycle pretty often,for I remember seeing the most appalling cuts and bruises on her legs.But she never complained,and always kept these accidents to herself.However,the great Mrs. Phillips,our cook, always knew all a hout them;as indeed she knew practically everything that ever happened.She used to draw us into the servants' hall to tell us privately:""Her Ladyship had a nasty fall yesterday;she cut both her knees and sprained her wrist.But don't Iet her know I told you.""So we never dared say anything.Similar little accidents used to occur when,at the age of nearly Seventy,she insisted on learning to drive a car.She never mastered the art of reversing ,and was in every way an unconventional and terrifying driver. Mrs.Phillips used then to tell us:""Her Ladyship ran into the back of a milk-cart yesterday;but it wasn't much hurt"";or""A policeman stopped her Ladyship because she was on the wrong side of the road;but she said she didn't know what the white Line on the road meant,so he explained arld Let her go on.""Mrs.Phillips must have had an excellent Intelligence Service at her command,for the stories were always true enough."

This story wants to tell us that _ .	"He's an old cobbler with a shop in the Marais, a historic area in Paris. When I took him my shoes, he at first told me, ""I haven't time. Take them to the other fellow on the main street. He'll fix them for you right away."" But I had my eyes on his shop for a long time. Just looking at his bench loaded with tools and pieces of leather, I knew he was a skilled craftsman . ""No."" I replied, ""The other fellow can't do it well."" ""The other fellow"" was one of those shopkeepers who fix shoes and make keys -- without knowing much about mending shoes or making keys. They work carelessly, and when they have finished sewing back a sandal strap , you might as well just throw away the pair. My man saw I wouldn't give in, and he smiled. He wiped hands on his blue apron , looked at my shoes, had me write my name on one shoe with a piece of chalk and said, ""Come back in a week."" I was about to leave when he took a pair of soft leather boots off a shelf. ""See what I can do?"" he said with pride. ""Only three of us in Paris can do this kind of work."" When I got back out into the street, the world seemed brand-new to me. He was something out of an ancient legend, this old craftsman with his way of speaking familiarly, his very strange dusty felt hat, his funny accent and his pride in his craft. These are times when nothing is important but the bottom line, when you can do things any old way as long as it ""pays"", when, in short, people look on work as a path to ever-increasing consumption rather than a way to realize their abilities. In such a period it is a rare comfort to find a cobbler who gets his greatest satisfaction from pride in a job well done."	['whatever you do, do it well']
Scientists pay special attention to the study of plants because .	"Plants are flowering faster than scientists predicted in reaction to climate change,which could have long damaging effects on food chains and ecosystems. Global warming is having a great effect on hundreds of plant and animal species around the world,changing some living patterns,scientists say. Increased carbon dioxide (CO2)in the air from burning coal and oil can have an effect on how plants produce oxygen,while higher temperatures and changeable rainfall patterns can change their patterns of growth. ""Predicting species' reaction to climate change is a major challenge in ecology,""said the researchers of several U.S. universities.They said plants had been the key object of study because their reaction to climate change could have an effect on food chains and ecosystem services. The study,published on the Nature website,uses the findings from plant life cycle studies and experiments across four continents and 1,634 species.It found that some experiments had underestimated the speed of flowering by 8.5 times and leafing by 4 times. ""Across all species,the experiments under-predicted the speed of the advance--for both leafing and flowering -- that results from temperature increases,""the study said. The design of future experiments may need to be improved to better predict how plants will react to climate change,it said. Plants are necessary for life on the Earth.They are the base of the food chain,using photosynthesis to produce sugar from carbon dioxide and water.They let out oxygen which is needed by nearly every organism on the planet. Scientists believe the world's average temperature has risen by about 0.8 degC since 1900,and nearly 0.2 degC every ten years since 1979. So far,efforts to cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases are not seen as enough to prevent the Earth heating up beyond 2 degC this century-- a point scientists say will bring the danger of a changeable climate in which weather extremes are common,leading to drought,floods,crop failures and rising sea levels."

How old was Audrey when she acted in Breakfast at Tiffany's?	"Audrey Hepburn won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her first major American movie, Roman Holiday, which was showed in 1953. But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character ""Gigi"" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was ""Hoolly Golinghtly"" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played ""Eliza Doolittle"" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects. Audrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer."	['32.']
We know from the passage that _ .	There was a time in my life when beauty meant something special to me. I guess that would have been when I was about six or seven years old, just several weeks or maybe a month before the orphanage turned me into an old man. I would get up every morning at the orphanage, make my bed just like the little soldier that I had become and then I would get into one of the two straight lines and march to breakfast with the other twenty or thirty boys who also lived in my dormitory. After breakfast one Saturday morning I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent chasing the beautiful monarch butterflies who lived by the hundreds in the bushes scattered around the orphanage. I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, and then took them from the net and then stuck straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet. How cruel it was to kill something of such beauty. I had walked many times out into the bushes, all by myself, just so the butterflies could land on my head, face and hands so I could look at them up close. When the telephone rang the house parent laid the large cardboard paper down on the back cement step and went inside to answer the phone. I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the one butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about so I reached down and touched it on the wing causing one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away but it was still pinned by the one wing with the other straight pin. Finally its wing broke off and the butterfly fell to the ground and just trembled. I picked up the torn wing and the butterfly and I spat on its wing and tried to get it to stick back on so it could fly away and be free before the house parent came back. But it would not stay on him.	['the author failed to stick the worn wing onto the butterfly with his spit']
The scene in Gallegos' class is mentioned at the beginning of the passage to _ .	"Wendy Gallegos writes ""concer"" on the board. One of her students raises her hand. ""Ms. Gallegos, you should have written 'conocer' instead,"" she said, referring to the Spanish verb for ""to know."" Gallegos looks at the board, smiles and quickly erases her mistake. ""You see, I have taught you so well, you pick up on my mistakes,"" she said with a laugh. To Gallegos, the scene in her classroom is typical of the children she teaches. Gallegos teaches high school Spanish. She became part of their lives and families for three years. She is willing to help her children succeed. After a couple of years, Gallegos' class becomes like home. Gallegos' Spanish class is taught mostly in English in sixth grade. By the time the students are eighth-graders, they are speaking fewer words of English and more of Spanish during the 50-minute classes. ""My goal is to get my kids to say something in Spanish every day,"" she said, ""I want them to be able to talk to me. That's why I help them, I praise them, I recognize them when they do good work. And we have fun. _ .'' If a student needs help, Gallegos offers the student a ""lifesaver,"" which is help from a classmate. The lifesaver gets a piece of candy as a reward. As the students said: ""Gallegos' class is anything but boring."" It is because of Gallegos' efforts and determination that she is the teacher who they think is most deserving of one of Collier County's Golden Apple Awards. ""I don't teach a subject, I teach kids. This is what I was born to do,"" Gallegos said."	['show her good teaching method in daily class']

The writer thinks that the assistant in a bookshop should _ .	"Time spent in a bookshop can be most enjoyable, whether you are book-lover or only there to buy a book as a present. You may even have entered the shop just to find a shelter from a sudden shower. Whatever the reason is, you can soon be totally unaware of your surroundings. You soon become attracted in some books or others, and usually it is only much later that you realize you have spent too much time there and must dash off to keep some forgotten appointments. This opportunity to escape the realities of everyday life is the main attraction of a bookshop. A music shop is very much like a bookshop. You can wander round such a place to your heart's content. If it is a good shop, no assistant will approach you with the greeting ""Can I help you?"" You needn't buy anything you don't want. In a bookshop an assistant should remain in the back ground until you have finished reading. Then, and only then, are his services necessary. Once a medical student had to read a text book which was far too expensive for him to buy. He couldn't obtain it from the library and the only copy he could find was in a certain bookshop. Every afternoon, therefore, he would go along to the shop and read a little of the book at a time. One day, however, he was disappointed to find the book missing from its usual place. He was about to leave, when he noticed the owner of the shop beckoning to him. Expecting to be told off, he went towards him. To his surprise, the owner pointed to the book which was tucked away in a corner. ""I put it there in case anyone was tempted to buy it!"" he said, and left the delighted student to continue his reading."	['not disturb the customers when they read']

You can draw the audience's attention to your speech by _ .	Great speakers are not born but made. You too can become a good orator by taking up the public speaking courses. Those who are incapable of speaking in front of the public can' t come up in their life. The art of public speaking must be practiced by everybody who wants to reach great heights in their career. A lot of public speaking courses are available on the Internet. Choosing the best course that is right for you may be difficult but not impossible. The basic motive of public speaking courses should be to train you to become a public speaker and improve your skills of _ a public speech. The course should first educate you with the principles of public speaking and tell you how to overcome stress and anxiety. By overcoming fear, you will be able to deliver your presentation clearly to your audience. A speaker can have a great influence on the audience with his body language and your public speaking course should tell you the gestures on stage that can attract the audience. Non-verbal communication also has a major role to play in delivering a speech effectively to a group. Though body language is important, the content and the natural use of words are what the audience are closely caring about. Public speaking courses should give tips in using the right words at the right time. Even though you have prepared well, the real success of public speaking lies in the way your speech is delivered. Public speaking courses will train you to present the contents in a lively manner impressing the audience. Your presentation should be professional and stylish. You can add humor or interactive sessions to your presentation to gain the audience attraction.	['following the public course']
Parker asked for ten pounds of steak because _ .	"Ellen Parker was worried about her health. She could not walk very quickly and it was difficult for her to climb stairs. She was soon out of breath.

It seems ridiculous to the writer that _ .	"When I was seven, my father gave me a Timex, my first watch. I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these tell the time -- which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists ; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while these wise people have realized that they don't need them, others -- including some distinguished ones of our time -- are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS 250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days, all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Yes, you may say expensive watches will come with some extra functions -- but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea to test its function of waterproof, or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole by using its compass? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead, the Swiss re-invented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man ---- usually a famous star, wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are classified as ""investment items"" now. A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS 350, 000, while 1960s Rolexes have gone from 15, 000 to 30, 000 plus in a year. But, to some wealthy people, a watch is more than an investment. It's a valuable toy for self-satisfaction, a matter of fashion. Prices may keep going up -- they've been rising for fifteen years. But when fashion moves on, the owner of that PS 350, 000 treasured object will suddenly find his pride and joy is no more a good investment than my childhood Times."

In which aspect do the toys created by Gilbert differ from those by Charles?	"The early 1900s were very different from today, when toys were still the delight of children everywhere. Theodore Roosevelt's Presidency marks the beginning of the ""Teddy Bear"". In the year 1902,toy bears were named ""Teddy"" after the president's nickname. The Teddy Bear became known worldwide and it was only a few years later that the Teddy Bears were mass produced. In 1913,an item called the Erector Set was invented. It was a steel,motorized toy that children could use to build models of anything. Its creator was A.C.Gilbert,a medical doctor. Charles Pajeau created a similar wooden set called Tinker Toys in the year 1914.Tinker Toys were made for younger children. Raggedy Ann dolls first came on the scene after newspaper cartoonist Johnny Gruelle reproduced the doll he made for his daughter. That was in 1915. The following year,an architect's son named John Lloyd Wright,invented Lincoln Logs,which were interlocked to make structures. Two years after Mickey Mouse was created,stuffed Mickey Mouse dolls were made by Charlotte Clark. This was the start of Disney merchandise. The yoyo became popular in the United States after Donald Duncan bought a yoyo company in 1929. The ViewMaster,a three dimensional viewer,was developed by a camera enthusiast named William Gruber. The toy became popular when Gruber licensed Disney characters to make still, 3D images from Disney movies and television programs. Finally,in 1940,model airplanes were mass produced. They started out as a way for manufacturers to sell planes to the military,but later caught on as a toy. The toys that we know and love today have had their roots from these ancient times. Thanks to all these creative man's efforts, we know otherwise what we may never know."	['Material used']
This passage doesn't talk about _ .	"When does music in public places become noise pollution? You may like at least some kind of music. But the problem is that, in lots of places, you're made to hear somebody else's choice in music. Say you've just landed at an airport. At the airport, the ""background"" music may be played loudly. When you are on the way to your hotel, there may be another kind of music played by the taxi driver. Then you finally reach your hotel. But when you are taking the elevator ,there is elevator music. You go out to dinner and end up in a place where the owner of the restaurant thinks music will help make you eat more and spend more. Then a person playing the violin comes around. This is called the ""music wallpaper"". It is to make you buy more and eat a lot. Even the government thinks this is ""noise pollution,"" especially when the music is too loud. Noise pollution may be bad for our hearing. It's also bad for some of our daily activities, such as sleeping, conversations and so on. The fact that you can't see, taste or smell it may help explain why it has not received as much attention as other kinds of pollution, such as air pollution or water pollution. The air around us is always filled with sounds, but most of us would not think we are surrounded by noise. This can be bad for our health. So many people like soft and quiet music in their house."

The passage is likely to appear in _ .	Australians have evidently realized the fact that water means life and we need to he more thoughtful in our use of this rather precious resource.Since the year 2000, Australians have managed to reduce their use of water by 14% . In the most populous city, Sydney, they've managed to use less water in 2007 than in 1974, even though the city grew by l. 2 million souls in this period. Across the country nearly 20% of all households have water tanks.That would probably be due, in large part, to the various state governments offering generous . In NSW, for example, where 24,000 households have taken up the offer, you can get $1,500 AUD back if you fix a 7,000 + litre tank and have it attached into your toilet and washing machine. Creywater use has taken off too. The Australian Bureau of Statistics suggest that it's now the second most common source of water in Australia, with over half of the country's homes reusing water from their washing machines, showers and baths. The state of Victoria leads with 70% using greywater, and Queensland, coming close behind with 63%. Up in the northern state of.Queensland, some of their dams have been below 20%. Sydney's main dam is only at 56% of its potential capacity. The country's ongoing drought has seen more than 95% of the length of the Murray- Darling Basin ( the two major river systems that supply the nation's 'food basket' ) regarded as ' degraded', Supply of water has become such an issue that hydro-electric power output has dropped 7% in a recent 9 year period for the states of NSW, Victoria and Tasmania.Not good for promoting our uptake understanding of renewable energy in these climate changing times.But at least the message is getting through about making every drop count.

When did De Will make his first trial of the magazine?	As De Witt Wallace lay in bed recovering from injuries that he unfortunately came by in World War I, he found there was a wealth of interesting information to read. Realizing few people would have the time to get through all this information, he knew exactly what to do. In 1920, this young American submitted a sample magazine containing shortened articles to publishers across America. However, all turned him down. Undeterred, De Witt and his new bride Lila Bell Acheson published the first issue of Reader's Digest in February 1922. Working from home, the Wallaces printed 5,000 copies, which were sold by mail to 1,500 people and priced at 25 cents. From these humble beginnings grew the world's most widely-read magazine. The magazine became popular and, by 1935, sales topped one million. In 1938, the first international edition was published in the United Kingdom. During World War II, editions were published for the first time in Latin America and Sweden. After the war Reader's Digest moved into Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, South Africa and Switzerland. In 1950, Reader's Digest published its shortened Books (now known as Select Editions in Australia). In 1959, music, the first non-print product line, was introduced. In 1962, Reader's Digest revolutionized direct mail by introducing easy-to-enter Sweepstakes and a year later the first Reader's Digest general book was published. In 1986, video was added to the Reader's Digest product line. In 1973, the Wallaces gave up active management of Reader's Digest. De Witt died in 1981, aged 91; Lila in 1984, aged 94. With no heirs to the Wallace empire to take control, Reader's Digest became a public company in the early 1990s and is now headed by a Chief Executive Office and Chairman of the Board.	['In 1920.']
In Englishspeaking countries,parents often choose shortened names because they want to keep what they and their children talk about _ .	"The most popular names in the west Every year in Englishspeaking countries,people list the most popular names. Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means ""beautiful"". If a boy is called Wu,his name means ""like a soldier"". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star. David is a popular name in Britain,partly because of the fame of the footballer David Beckham."	['personal']
Small talk happens most probably except when _ .	In our daily life, it is necessary to make small talk in certain situations. It helps to fill time between people when it is completely quiet. You may not feel like talking with someone else or you are very shy at the beginning, but it is sometimes thought to be rude to say nothing. People use small talk almost every day. It usually takes place when you meet someone you don't know at all or someone you're not familiar with. For example, waitresses and hairdressers often make small talk with their customers. If you happen to be outside when the mailman comes to your door, you might make small talk with him, too. Most often, small talk happens in places where people are waiting for something. For example, you might talk with another person who is waiting for the bus to arrive. People also make small talk in a doctor's waiting room, or when they are waiting in a line to buy something. At the office, people make small talk in elevators or lunchrooms, especially if there is a line-up. Mingling is often required among people who don't know each other very well at a party. In other words, they are expected to walk around and talk with others. The most common time for small talk to happen is the first time you see or meet someone on a given day. For example, if you see a co-worker in the lounge you might say hello and discuss the sports or weather. However, the next time you see each other you might just smile and say nothing. If there is very little noise, it might be the right time to start a pleasant conversation. If someone is reading a book at the bus stop, it is probably not a good idea to start a conversation. Another good time to make small talk is during a break in a meeting when there is nothing important going on. However, it is important to recognize the signal when the other person wants the conversation to stop.	"[""you're having a meeting""]"
"What do some students think is because of ""your genes""?"	"A new report says promising children money to pass exams does not help exam grades. The report says parents could be wasting their money by using cash to get their kids to study more. However, the promise of a trip somewhere nice could encourage students to try harder and do better at school. Researchers from the University of Bristol (in England) and the University of Chicago (in the USA) looked at how promises of cash and tickets to events affected students' studying and learning. Over 10,000 pupils took part in the research throughout the year 2012. There was an improvement in classwork and homework, but this did not result in better test scores. Lead researcher Dr Simon Burgess suggested the research looked at the wrong areas. He said it had not looked at the things that really got students to increase their effort. He added that: ""Clearly, some pupils have a lot of goals and believe that education is a way of getting what they want out of life, but there are kids who think that working hard doesn't make a difference."" He said these children think exam success is ""all in your genes"" because of their family background. Education expert Dr Kevan Collins said good teachers were better than promises of rewards to get children to study, especially for children from low-income families. He wrote: ""What really makes the difference is how students are taught."""	['exam success']
Children feel it hard for them to go upstairs because _ .	"Are you carrying too much on your back to school? I'm sure lots of your age will say ""Yes"". Not only the students in China have this problem, but children in the United States also have heavy school bags. Doctors are starting to worry about that younger and younger students are having problems as a result of school bags being too heavy for them. ""It's hard for me to go upstairs with my bag because it's so heavy,"" said Rich Hammond, an 11-year-old student in the US. Rich is among students who have common school bags with two straps to carry them, but many other choose rolling bags. But even with rolling bags, getting up stairs and houses is still a problem for children. Many of them have hurt backs and necks because of the heavy school bags. But how much is too much? Doctors say students should carry no more than 10% to 15% of their own body weight. Scott Bautch, a black doctor, said children under Grade 4 should stay with 10%. But it is also important that older children don't stay with over 15%, because their bodies are still growing. ""Children are losing their balance and falling down with their school bags,"" he said. Parents and teachers are starting to tell children to only take home library books that they will be reading at night. Some teachers are using pieces of paper or thin workbooks for students to take home. One of the best answers is, as some children said, to have no homework at all."

Finding summer jobs for teenagers has not always been easy, but now you no longer have to worry about what your kid can do to earn their own money.Recently I found some different sites online that offer information about what kids can do.Below is some of that information, along with questions to think about to help you come up with your own ideas. Ideas for summer work *Parks and Recreation Programs. *Babysitting during the day of school. *Working part-time at a day care for the summer. *Car washing. *Working at local vegetable stands. The easiest way for you to find ways for your child to make money is to think about others' inconveniences .Think of things you need done, or would like to have done, and what you would consider paying for these things to get done.Once you have some ideas, you can sit down with your child and talk to them about what they would be interested in doing.Then once you have an idea of what they want to do you can help them come up with fair prices. Preferably you would want to only have your child working with people you know and trust, or in the least bit you could have your child pick a partner.That way with each of them carrying cell phones, even those without service can call 911, they will be much safer.

When the first piece hits the South Atlantic,it causes _ .	The year is 2094,It has been announced that a comet is heading towards the Earth.Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. On 17 July, a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion.About half of the piece is destoryed but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200times the speed of sound.The sea boils and a huge gole is made in the sea bed.Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole.The eall of water,a kilometer high,rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour.Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. Before the waves reach South America.the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina.Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Moutains.The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles,San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes,Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead,but the north won't eacape for long.Because of the explosions the sun is hidden by clouds of dust,and temperatures around the world fall to almost zero.Crops are ruined.The sun won't be seen again for many years.Wars break out as countries fight for food.A year later,no more than 10 million remain laive. Could it really happen?In fact,it has already happened more than once in the history of the Earth.The dinesaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years,Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared.Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space. The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out .Will we meet the same end ?	['huge waves']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"You may know May Day, but do you know Lei Day? Like May Day, Lei Day is also celebrated on May 1st. People wear leis on this day. A lei is a big circle usually made of flowers . On Lei Day, people give leis to each other. Where do you know this holiday is celebrated? Hawaii, of course! People give leis on birthdays, weddings and as a way to say ""I love you"". In 1928, a writer, Don Blanding, wrote an article saying that this tradition should become a holiday. Another writer, Grace Tower Warren, thought of the idea of celebrating this day on May 1st and said, ""May Day is Lei Day.""On this day in 1928, people wore leis and celebrated with music, dancing and a lei-making competition. The next year, Lei Day became a public holiday. Today, people still celebrate Lei Day in Hawaii. We hope they all have a happy May Day and a happy Lei Day!"	['Lei Day was first celebrated in 1928.']
The best title of the passage would be _ .	"The old man walked slowly into the restaurant. With head tilted, and shoulders bent forward he leaned on his trusty stick with each unhurried step. His torn cloth jacket, patched trousers, worn out shoes, and warm personality made him stand out from the usual Saturday morning breakfast crowd. He stopped, turned with his whole body, and winked at a little girl seated by the door. She flashed a big smile right back at him. A young waitress named Mary watched him walk toward a table by the window. She ran over to him, and said, ""Here, Sir. Let me give you a hand with that chair."" She pulled the chair away from the table. Steadying him with one arm, she helped him move in front of the chair, and get comfortably seated. Then she moved the table up close to him, and leaned his stick against the table where he could reach it. In a soft, clear voice he said, ""Thank you, Miss. And bless you for your kind gestures."" ""You're welcome, Sir."" She replied. ""And my name is Mary. I'll be back in a moment, and if you need anything at all in the mean time, just wave at me!"" After he had finished a hearty meal, Mary brought him the change from his ticket. He left it on the table. She helped him and walked with him to the front door. Holding the door open for him, she said, ""Come back and see us, Sir!"" He turned and nodded a thank-you. ""You are very kind."" he said softly, smiling. When Mary went to clean his table, she almost fainted. Under his plate she found a business card, and a note scribbled on a napkin. Under the napkin was a one-hundred-dollar bill. The note on the napkin read, ""Dear Mary, I respect you very much, and you respect yourself too. It shows by the way you treat others. You have found the secret of happiness. Your kind gestures will shine through those who meet you."" The man she had waited on was the owner of the restaurant where she worked. This was the first time that she, or any of his employees had ever seen him in person."	['The Secret of Happiness']
The passage implies that a snow ranger	"The two things - snow and mountains - which are needed for a ski area are the two things that cause avalanches, large mass of snow and ice crushing down the side of a mountain--often called ""White Death."" It was the threat of the avalanche and its record as a killer of man in the western mountains that created the snow ranger. He first started on avalanche control work in the winter of 1937 -38 at Alta, Utah, in Wasatch National Forest. This mountain valley was becoming well known to skiers. It was dangerous. In fact, more than 120 persons had lost their lives in 1936 and another 200 died in 1937 as a result of avalanches before it became a major ski area. Thus, development of Alta and other major ski resorts in the west was dependent upon controlling the avalanche. The Forest Service set out to do it, and did, with its corps of snow rangers. It takes many things to make a snow ranger. The snow ranger must be in excellent physical condition. He must be a good skier and a skilled mountain climber He should have at least a high school education, and the more college courses in geology, physics, and related fields he has, the better. He studies snow, terrain, wind, and weather. He learns the conditions that produce avalanches. He learns to forecast avalanches and to bring them roaring on down the mountainsides to reduce their killing strength. . The snow ranger learns to do this by using artillery, by blasting with TNT, and by the difficult and skillful art of skiing avalanches down. The snow ranger, dressed in a green parka which has a bright yellow shoulder patch, means safety for people on ski slopes. He pulls the trigger on a 75 mm. Recoilless rifle, skis waist deep in powder testing snow stability, or talks with the ski area's operator as he goes about his work to protect the public from the hazards of deep snow on steep mountain slopes."

The writer stayed in Hangzhou for _ days.	May 2, Saturday We arrived in Hangzhou at 3:00p.m. After we walked out of the train station, we took a taxi to the hotel. The hotel was very clean. We stayed there for three days. Then we wanted to travel to Hainan. May 5, Tuesday In the morning we went to Hainan by plane. The people in Hainan were very friendly.

Then we went to the aquarium to see some sea animals. We saw many kinds of fish. They were very lovely. I hope I could come to Hainan again.	['three']
John Denver wrote his songs about many things except _ .	John Denver has got international fame as a pop star, songwriter, actor and environmental activist ( ). Songs like Take Me Home, Country Road, Rocky Mountain High and Annie's Song have become very popular. But less than thirty years ago, John Denver was a young man with little more than a fine voice, a guitar, and a dream. Growing up in conservative family, he was not believed to drop out of college and head to Los Angeles, where the music scene was flowering. Nor was he believed to succeed. In Take Me Home, John Denver talked about the story that shaped his life, with the story of the rich inner journey of a shy Midwestern boy. With honesty and cleverness, he wrote about his childhood, the feeling of moving to Los Angeles as the 60s came, his first lucky breaks, his first songwriting success with leaving on a Jet Plane and finally got a world fame. He also wrote about his relationship with his first and second wife, as well as his parents, his children, his partners through his life and his friends. Honest and rich in the book that only a natural-born storyteller could write so well, Take Me Home is very good from the beginning to the end. It's like spending a few days with a good friend.

Which of the following best explains the title of the passage?	"Cell Phones Are the New Cigarettes When you get on a bus, you reach for it. When you're at work, you take a break to have a moment alone with it. When you are waiting for dinner, you play with it. Cigarette? No, it's another most addictive thing in the beginning of the 21st century, the cell phone (i.e. the mobile phone). Experts say it is becoming more difficult for many people to curb their wishing to hug it more tightly than most of their personal relationships. With its charming surface and its satisfying touch, the cell phone connects us even if we are only three feet away. In just the past few years, the cell phone has challenged individuals, employers, phone makers and counselors in ways that its inventors in the late 1940s never imagined. The costs are becoming even more evident, and I don't mean just the monthly bill. Dr. Chris Knippers, a counselor at the Betty Ford Center in Southern California, reports that the overuse of cell phones has caused a social problem: a barrier to one-on-one personal contact. This may sound extreme. But we've all witnessed the evidence: the person at a restaurant who talks on the phone through an entire meal, ignoring his kids around the table; the woman who talks on the phone all the way, ignoring her husband; the teenager who texts messages all the way home from school, avoiding contact with other kids all around him. How is this improving the quality of our life? Jim Williams, an industrial sociologist based in Massachusetts, notes that cell-phone addiction is a symptom in a widening gulf of personal separation. The study conducted in 2014 notes that one-quarter of Americans say they have no one to discuss their most important personal business with. Despite the growing use of phones, e-mail and instant messaging, we young people don't have as many friends as our parents. ""Just as more information has led to less wisdom, more acquaintances via the Internet and cell phones have produced fewer friends,"" he says.

Which of the following is NOT a reason why rats are chosen to find buried landmines?	"The rat is named Lola and she's at the top of her class of risk-running animals being trained to smell out landmines in Colombia, home to the world's highest number of mine-related deaths and injuries last year. Of the victims, many are children who died in _ while walking to school or playing in the countryside. The smartest rat among the first six that the government is teaching to locate landmines equipment planted by rebels has a 90 percent success rate in locating landmines material in her lab training. Police animal trainers, tired of seeing their landmines-smelling dogs blown up by stepping on mines, hope the white-furred, pink-eyed creature will lead her classmates through coming open field tests and then into the country mine fields before the end of the year. It takes about 400 grams of pressure to detonate a mine while Lola only weighs about 220 grams. ""The dogs can easily set off the landmines, sometimes killing people nearby,"" they said. Police animal trainer Jose Pineda says that rats have more sensitive noses than dogs, which should allow them to better smell out mines in difficult terrain . Plus, it takes the police about six months to train mine-smelling dogs. Training the rats is expected to take about half that time once the program is established. Trainers think that they are much smarter than the dogs. The second-best scorer in the laboratory is Lucrecia, with an 83 percent success rate. Males, such as one named Runcho, have fallen behind until now but may do better in the coming field tests. Pineda said that the next step of training will present new challenges to the rats as they are sure to meet distractions in the open."	['They can smell all kinds of explosive materials.']
Graham saved his dog first possibly because _ .	"When you hear about a man saving his dog from a sinking ship, it's hard not to be moved by the tale of an animal lover's bravery.But the story becomes slightly less heroic when you learn that the man saved his dog before his own wife. But that's apparently what happened when Graham Annie and his wife, Cheryl, found their Yacht sinking after it hit a rock, while on a voyage from East London to Madagascar. National Sea Rescue Institute North London station commander Geoff McGregor said all three were wearing life jackets.The 9-year-old Jack Russell terrier named Rosie was wearing a tailored life jacket equipped with a light. ""As the incident happened Graham sent a radio distress call for help and activated the EPIRB (a GPS beacon) but they were immediately forced to abandon ship,"" McGregor said in an interview, ""He first swam Rosie to the shore safely before returning for his wife, whose safety line had caught on the steering gear McGregor added. The couple and their dog all made it out free of injury.Graham, a long-time volunteer with the National Sea Rescue Institute, said, ""it was humbling to have the shoe on the other foot and need to be rescued."" Some details have yet to come out.So, it's likely that Cheryl was in a position of safety and Rosie might have been in a more dangerous position had she been left on the boat. The couple did not want to speak with the media about their rescue.So, for now, it's left to readers to find out Graham's priorities during their troubled time."

According to this passage, which word can best describe Jim Hawkins?	Treasure Island isn't a true story, _ armed to the teeth and ready to go treasure hunting. But you will find, as you read this book, that although pirates can be murderous and treacherous ,they can also be cowardly, superstitious, and easily led. As it turns out, that is fortunate for Jim Hawkins. It's a brilliant story. Billy Bones, a retired seaman, comes to live at the Admiral Benbow inn. Jim is just a boy, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always on the look-out for strangers arriving at the inn. And well he might be nervous, because he carries with him in his battered old sea-chest a map drawn by Captain Flint himself giving the whereabouts of all Flint's buried treasure! Captain Flint! -the most feared pirate ever to travel the high seas. Well,Flint is dead, but there are plenty of men who served with Captain Flint still alive who will feel they have a fair claim to the treasure. The map, though, ends up in the possession of Jim Hawkins---(it's a near thing, read the book to see how that happens) Jim tells the secret in the local doctor, who quickly joins forces to acquire a ship and crew to sail for Treasure Island There's a famous scene where Jim, hiding in the apple barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned. It's a bad moment. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to have it all their own way. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim. And now, you will have to read the book for yourself. This is a fantastic tale of cheat, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if it hadn't been for Jim Hawkins. For it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place. And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all? No? Well, don't expect me to tell you. Don't be nervous of reading a 'classic'. I know it was published a long time ago, but that doesn't mean it is difficult to read. There is one piece of advice I will give, though. I don't think this book is ever out of print---there are hundreds of different copies around. If you can, choose a copy with large enough print to be able to read comfortably, and exciting illustrations. It makes all the difference. Go ahead! Read the book. I think you'll love it.	['brave']
Why did the man want to buy the cat? Because _ .	"A man was looking for things of old times.One day he came to a village and found a blue bowl which looked very old.The bowl was on the ground and a cat was drinking milk from it.A farmer,the owner of the cat.was lying beside the bowl.In order not to draw the farmer's attention to the value of the bowl,the man said to him in a soft voice,""What a nice cat you have! Won't you sell it to me?"" ""How much would you give me for it?"" the farmer opened his eyes and asked. ""Twenty dollars. Would it be enough?"" A few minutes later,the farmer agreed.After he paid the farmer,the man said,""My cat will feel thirsty.May I take the bowl so that the cat can have milk?"" But the farmer said, ""I'm sorry I can't give it to you.Thanks to the bowl,I can sell twenty cats."""	['he thought he could easily get the bowl if he bought the cat']
At the information stand, visitors to Hinckley's Buzzard Festival can _ .	"Every spring scores of people flock to the Buzzard Festival at Hinckley, Ohio. They come to watch for buzzards. Most would be glad just to take a look at a buzzard. If they do see one of these"" flying garbage cans"", it will probably be circling high in the sky. From there it can watch the ground for signs of the waste and the dead animals on which it feeds. The buzzard is the ugliest bird in the United States. In fact, it may well be the ugliest bird in the world. It has a small, bare, pink head. Its thick body is covered with dark, rough feathers. In spite of its looks, the buzzard is important to the people of Hinckley. It is their first sign of spring. After a winter in the south, buzzards return to their homes in the north. In the Hinckley area, they always return on March 15. No one knows why. But they have come back to Hinckley Ridge on that day, sure as clocks work, for at least forty years. The excitement starts in February. By the middle of March it has reached a high peak. Bets are placed. Prizes go to the person who sees the first buzzard. Radio stations and newspapers tell of the coming festival. And on the weekend after March 15 the people of Hinckley hold their Buzzard Festival. The people come and look around. They chat. They eat their fill of pancakes and sausages. Then they drive past Buzzard's Roost on Hinckley Ridge. A lot of them stop near the road at the stand set up to give information to visitors. There they can hear, from a recording, the main facts about the buzzard. They can see a stuffed buzzard. They can look at some pictures taken of buzzards in other years. With good luck and a strong pair of field glasses, they may sight one or two live buzzards high in the sky. Buzzards may be ugly. They may be ""flying garbage cans"". But in Hinckley they are just as welcome as the swallows in Capistrano, California. It would be a sad spring indeed if the buzzards ever failed to come back to Hinckley Ridge."

The much-feared M-day was _ .	"After a fortnight of extraordinary type, the much-feared computer virus that was supposed to strike the globe's hard drives last Friday simply fizzled. So many warnings were sounded that most computer owners either fed anti-virus programs into their systems or refused to turn the power on during the dreaded M-day. They dodged one disease, but more strains are on the way. The eponymous Friday-the-13th virus is due to strike this week, and the Maltese Amoeba may detonate on March 15. Who creates these things? A disproportionate number seems to originate in Bulgaria or Russia, where writing the smallest, most elegant virus programs has become a matter of quirky pride. Viruses are transmitted either by shared disks (as was Michelangelo) or over telephone lines. The virus program hides in a computer until, activated by a date, time, or some other trigger, it springs to life. The most common virus, Stoned, makes your screen announce: ""Your computer is now stoned. Legalize marijuana. "" (Regardless of your politics, you don't want this one around; it can damage your files inadvertently.) Solution: either keep your computer isolated--no trading disks, no on-line communication--or else install one of a dozen or so commercially available anti-virus programs that detect and delete the little time bombs. If they can come up with a virus that is hidden, will they next try to extort a business?--as in, pay me $1 million or my virus will destroy your system. In the meantime, money is being made by firms selling anti-virus programs. Egghead software stores logged a 3,000 percent jump in anti-virus sales. Was the threat overblown by the companies that make millions selling anti-virus software? Thanks to the media blitz, no one will ever know what might have happened--an unallied number of computer owners discovered and deleted Michelangelo before it was supposed to strike--on the artist's birthday."

What do we know about the online tutoring?	"India was once part of the British Empire, but thanks to modern technology and a booming economy, it has turned the tables on its former colonial master. Indian tutors are helping to teach math to British children over high-speed Internet connections. Early results suggest the idea is improving exam results. But not everyone is happy at this ""outsourcing"" of tutoring. It's 3:30, and pupils at Raynham Primary School in London are gathering for their after-school maths lessons. Five time zones-- thousands of kilometers away--their math tutors are also arriving for class. High-speed Internet has made it possible for Indian tutors to teach British pupils in real time. Each pupil gets a dedicated one-to-one online tutor. The students work with activities on their computer screen and wear a headset and microphone to talk to their tutor. The class teacher, Altus Basson, says he has seen an improvement in results. ""There are some children who've really rocketed in their results. Children who struggleto focus in class focus a lot better on the laptops. The real advantage is that each child gets a focused activity and a single tutor,"" he said. Such individualized teaching is the core idea of Brightspark Education, the company that provides the online tutoring, says founder Tom Hooper. ""Children today feel very confident online; they feel very engaged; they feel very in control. And that's half the battle with education.Give them control, make them feel confident and enjoy their learning and you'll see them start to improve and embrace it,"" he said. Raynham Primary School is among the first in Europe to try online tutoring. At between $20 and $25 an hour, it's about half the cost of face-to-face coaching. But some people say an Internet connection is not enough of a connection for teaching and learning. Kevin Courtney is deputy General Secretary of Britain's National Union of Teachers. ""We think, there's a really important emotional connection between a teacher and a child whether it's a whole class or whether it's one-to-one. You need that immediacy of feedback and we're not convinced that that can happen across an Internet connection. In one of the wealthiest.countries in the world, we think that we can afford to have teachers with genuine emotional connection there with the children,"" he said. Brightspark Education says the online tutoring is used only as an addition to supplement regular teaching. The company says its service does not represent a threat to teachers' jobs in Britain. Parents say they're very satisfied with the results they've seen. And what about the children?Children: ""I love it!""I love it!""I hate maths!"" So math--or, as the British call it, maths--is still not everyone's favorite subject even with the latest technology to teach it."	['Tutors and students are in different places.']
We can infer from the text that school uniforms _ .	There are quite a few advantages of wearing school uniforms. The idea may seem disagreeable at first, but considering all the positive effective coming from wearing uniforms you would be more likely to enjoy them. Teachers love school uniforms because it helps provide an orderly learning environment. Having students dressed in uniforms may teach them how to present themselves in a neat and professional manner. It gives students the opportunity to learn how to dress like young ladies and gentleman. And they can focus their attention on academics rather than style. Purchasing school uniforms is easy and needs less hesitation and consideration. No matter what the school' s policy is, there are only specific essential pieces to the wardrobe that are necessary, so _ . A few wardrobe items can last a long time. Parents could also enjoy an easy morning, as it will take less time to choose a set of clothes for the school day. Students wearing uniforms will feel less pressure about what to wear or not to wear when their classmates are dressed similarly. Getting dressed before school becomes less of a chore when students are limited in their choices, so there shouldn't be any trouble about choosing an outfit for the day and getting ready quickly. Some students may not like the lack of individuality with a uniform, but some school dress code policies may offer them the opportunities to show their unique styles. Uniforms today are also becoming trendier and can be seen in many areas of pop culture. Celebrities and fashion designers are using uniforms as inspiration for new looks which also appeal to students.	['will be more fashionable in the future']
In America, if you don't know the answer to the question in class, you should _ .	The class in America is almost the same as that in China. But something is different. In America, if the teacher asks you a question but you don't understand, you should put up your hand and ask the teacher to repeat it. If you don't know the answer, it is all right to tell the teacher you don't know. Then he or she knows what you need to learn. You mustn't be _ on a test day. If you're badly ill, call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows make-up tests , you should take the test in one or two days after you go back to school. Be on time! It is impolite to be late. If you come late, be sure to do it quietly. Take your books out of your bag after you go into the classroom. Then go to your seat and sit down quietly. In the US, you needn't knock at the door before you come into the classroom. If you have to leave during the class, do it quietly, too. There is no need to ask the teacher's agreement.

Why was the author finally determined to desert all the college materials?	For twenty years, I saved all my college course notes and textbooks: that's a lot of paper. Worse, it's not easy to carry them around -- and trust me, they aren't light -- on at least seven moves. Yet I never once looked at them. They sat in our basement, covered in a thick layer of dust. If books and papers could wonder, they'd wonder why they were still under our stairs after all those years. When would the Big Day come? Well, the Big Day eventually did arrive; only it was different than expected. My wife, always more accepting changes than I am, finally talked me into clearing out the entire mess. The pain I experienced was also unexpected. What hurt me was to come across those terrible papers I'd written, which reminded me of my poor study habits, and an embarrassing lack of comprehension. It was great to get rid of them. But it was also a clearing of personal history. At first, I struggled with this. The truth was in the record that my books, my notes, and my papers were primary source materials, documenting an important time in my life. To clear them out was to clear out the truth. What I've learned since taking this leap is that the process is more important than the truth. I feel as if much of my real education during my college years isn't in the documents but now in me. So I am glad to free myself of this physical burden. And what's better is that I don't need to look back to those painful moments. They belong to the past. You might want to consider doing something similar, either under the stairs of your basement or in your mind. What is the personal rubbish piling in your life? Clear _ out and make your life awesome.

What can be inferred from the study of San Diego State University?	"Every year, more than four million babies are born in the United States. Some parents named their children based on family, cultural or religious traditions. Girls are often named after a family member but rarely their mothers. Sons, though, are often named after their fathers. Every year the Social Security Administration releases a list of the most popular baby names in America. Last year, Jacob was the most popular boy name and Emma the number one name for girls. These days, the choice of a baby name seems to be guided as much by individual desires as by tradition. This is shown in the fact that the most popular baby names are not as popular as they used to be. Researchers at San Diego State University in California did a study. They found that thirty-two percent of boys received one of the ten most popular names in 1955. The same was true for twenty-two percent of girls. By 2007, however, the numbers were down to less than ten percent of boys and only eight percent of girls. ""People are more and more interested in finding unusual names. And now since we have the information on the Internet of what the most popular names are, the percentage of kids who get them actually is going down because people are able to avoid them much more successfully than they did before,"" said Cleveland Evans, a professor of psychology at Bellevue University. Parents can find plenty of advice on the Web and in bookstores about choosing a baby name. A lot has also been written about the possible effects that a name might have on a child's future. There are studies that suggest children with unusual names are more likely to be teased. Other studies suggest that as adults, they might be less likely to get called for a job interview. Yet other research suggests that giving a child an unusual name might help build character. What all this adds up to is a big responsibility for parents to consider what's really in a name."	"[""Parents' idea on giving babies names are changing with social development.""]"
Which of the following is the conclusion the writer made about the old lady?	"It was blazing hot, just like most July days. I stepped into a tiny ice-cream shop to cool off with a chocolate ice-cream. It was an old woman bent over a table near the door. Her back was so badly twisted that her face nearly touched the tabletop. I sat down facing her a couple of tables away. ""Poor woman,"" I thought, ""What does she get out of life? Why God let people live so long past their _ ?"" As I thought, another aged lady entered the shop and sat down with her. Soon the two of them were talking about childhood days. They talked of how little the shop had changed in 70 years... In minutes, the two of them were trembling with laughter. I looked again at the first woman, then in the mirror on a nearby wall, catching a picture of myself. I was wearing a dirty shirt. She was well dressed in white, her hands sparking with gold rings. I was sad. She was laughing, smiling. I was putting the pieces of my life together. She had millions of wonderful memories to recall. I sat alone. She was sharing the day with a good friend. I was secretly worried about getting old. She was old, but it wasn't hurting her. As I left the shop, I thought of my foolish question about God letting people live past their prime. Why, that woman was more alive, more sensitive to life than I was. Age has not bent her spirit."	['She was more alive and sensitive to life than the writer.']

What made Alice decide to give a concert?	"Alice always wanted to be a singer. Music was the most important thing in her life, but to tell you the truth, she took lessons for years, practiced every day, but in spite of all this, her voice didn't improve. Honestly, it didn't get better, it just got louder. Her teacher finally gave up and stopped the lessons, but Alice refused to quit , and one day she decided to give a concert and invited her mere teacher to attend. The teacher was very worried about what to say after the performance. She knew it would be terrible and it was. She didn't want to tell a lie, but she didn't want to hurt Alice's feelings either. Finally, she got an idea and went backstage to greet her former pupil. ""Well,"" said Alice, ""what did you think of my performance?"" ""My dear,"" said the teacher, ""you'll never be better than you were tonight."""	['She wanted to prove that her teacher was wrong.']

He started to look at it carefully and began to touch it with his hand. To his surprise, the tortoise stopped moving. It pulled in its head and legs, and closed its shell tightly. He touched it again but the tortoise didn't move at all. Jack became angry. He used a stick and tried to make it open. When his father saw this, he stopped him and said, ""No, son, you mustn't do that! You will kill the tortoise. You won't get it open with a stick."" Jack asked, ""Why?"" ""Just wait and see,"" his father answered. Then he picked up the tortoise and put it in a bag. After they came back home, the father took the tortoise out of the bag. He put it near the fireplace . After a few minutes, the tortoise began to move a little. Then the tortoise stretched out its head and legs. At last, the tortoise began to move across the room. How excited Jack was when he saw this! ""Son, now you see,"" said his father, ""sometimes, you can't make someone do things he doesn't like.

In the passage, the writer intends to tell us that _ .	"When I met him, I had a lot of anger inside me. I've lived my whole life in Spanish Harlem, but in my neighborhood, there are shoot-ups all the time. I know kids who have been shot or beaten up. I have friends who ended up in prison. I could have ended up that way, too, but Mr. Clark wouldn't let that happen. Mr. Clark worked long hours, making sure I did my work. My grades rose. In fact, the scores of our whole class rose. One day, he took our class to see The Phantom of the Opera, and it was the first time some kids had ever been out of Harlem. Before the show, he treated us to dinner at a restaurant and taught us not to talk with our mouths full. We did not want to let him down. Mr. Clark was selected as Disney's 2000 Teacher of the Year. He said he would draw three names out of a hat ; those students would go with him to Los Angles to get the award. But when the time came to draw names, Mr. Clark said, ""You're all going."" On graduation day, there were a lot of tears. We didn't want his class to end. In 2001, he moved to Atlanta, but he always kept in touch. He started giving lectures about education, and wrote a best-selling book based on his classroom rules, The Essential 55. In 2003, Mr. Clark took some of us on a trip to South Africa to deliver school supplies and visit orphanages . It was the most amazing experience of my life. It's now my dream to start a group of women's clubs one day, helping people from all backgrounds."	['a good teacher has a good influence on his or her students']
If we have faith in future, we will _ .	Do you know what Fear and Faith have in common? Fear believes in a negative future. Faith believes in a positive future. Both believe in something that has not yet happened. So I ask you, if neither the positive nor negative future has happened yet then why not choose to believe in the positive future? I believe during these challenging times we have a choice between two roads: the positive road and the negative road. And our bus can't be on two roads at the same time. So we have to make a choice and this choice determines our belief about the future and the attitude and actions we bring to the present. I'm not saying we shouldn't have any fear. There are times when fear is a gift. A healthy dose of fear causes us to examine our situation and plan for the future. It moves us to smell the cheese and expect change. When used wisely it allows us to manage risk and make better decisions. Some fear is good. However, what I have observed lately is a supersized, huge dose of fear that is spreading the hearts and minds of far too many people. This oversized fear is causing leaders and their organizations to either act unreasonably or to not act at all. They are either hurrying in a million different directions because of fear. In both cases, fear is leading them to take the negative road to failure. The answer is the positive road paved with faith and a belief that your best days are not behind you but ahead of you. With this belief you make the right choices and actions today that will create your positive future tomorrow. You stay calm, focused and committed to your purpose. You look for ways to save money and cut costs without making unreasonable fear-based decisions that sacrifice your future success. You identify opportunities in the midst of the challenges and you focus on solutions instead of problems. Your faith and belief in a positive future leads to powerful actions today. The future has not happened yet and you have a say in what it looks like by the way you think and act. Fear or Faith. The choice is yours.	['take powerful actions today']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"When times get tough, we all look for ways to cut back. When we're hungry, we eat at home instead of going out. We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a ""three-year degree"" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly ""throw out"" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist ""diluting "" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine. If we want to help students find their way through university, we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation. We should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible. We should give them a chance to earn money as interns in meaningful part-time jobs that relate to their university studies, such as the five-year co-op program at Northeastern University. ks5uks5u"	"['most American universities are against the ""three-year degree"" model']"

In the view of the author, we know that _ .	Does being rich make you happy? Many studies on happiness give negative answers. Here are some points in being happy. Basic Human Needs Must Be Met People whose basic needs for shelter, clothing and food are not met will find it very difficult to feel happy. Of course, there are exceptions, but for most of us, we can only be happy once our basic needs are met. The Joneses Cannot Be Escaped People's happiness is not determined by how much they have, but by how much people around them have. So, we tend to feel happy once our basic needs are met and we have more than the people surrounding us. This means that while keeping up with _ could be destructive if we let it go too far. It is also part of humana nature to want to feel at least on the same level, financially, as those surrounding us. You Should Escape The Rat Race We should know the importance of staying out of the rat race. So yes, you need to work hard, get the education you need to land a good job and work long enough and hard enough to get to a place where you can easily meet your basic needs. What are basic needs? For most middle or upper middle class Americans, basic needs are not very basic anymore. For most of us, once our basic needs have been met, happiness is achieved when we engage in activities we like, spend time with friends and family and stay active. Making money for the sake of making money does not make people happy. Ideally, these questions should be answered when you're still young and just starting out. Don't wait until your midlife crisis to realize that half your life has passed you by and you're still unhappy.	['human basic needs are fundamental for being happy']
Victor did all the following during his research in the university EXCEPT that _ .	"For the 17 years my life was very happy. Then the first sad thing happened. My mother became very ill, and soon she knew that she was dying. Just before she died, she asked Elizabeth and me to go to her room. She held our hands and said, ""Victor and Elizabeth, my children, I'm very happy because you love each other, and because one day you'll get married. Everyone in the family loves you, Elizabeth. Will you take my place in the family, my dear? I can die happy if you look after them when I have gone."" My mother died and we were very sad, because we loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother's death. The time came for me to go to university. I didn't want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents of my good friend Henry would not let him go to university with me. So I had gone alone. On my first day at university I met my teacher, Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university. He ended his talk by saying, ""Some of you will become the greatest scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and discover everything that you can. This is why God made you intelligent--to help other people."" After the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I remembered the storm when I was 15; I remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree. From then on, I wanted to use electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things. I started to work the next day. I worked very hard and soon Professor Waldman and I realized that I could learn to be a very good scientist. The professor helped me very much, and other important scientists who were his friends helped me, too. I was interested in my work and I did not take one day's holiday during the next two years, I did not go home, and my letters to my family were very short. After two years, I had discovered many things and I built a scientific machine that was the best in the university. My machine would help me answer the most important question of all. How does life begin? Is it possible to put life into dead things? To answer these questions about life I had to learn first about death. I had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them. In the hospital and in the university, I watched the dying and the dead. Day after day, month after month, I followed death, so it was a dark and terrible time. I built a tall mast about 150 meters high, which is higher than the tallest building in the city, to catch lightning and send the electricity down to my machine in the lab. I believed I could use that electricity to give life to things that were dead. Then one day, the answer came to me. Suddenly I was sure that I knew the secret of life."

Which sentence is right?	In most parts of the world there are four seasons. They are spring, summer, fall and winter. In different seasons people wear different clothes and do different things. For example, in summer the weather is hot, so people usually wear cool clothes and do things like swimming, boating or surfing . But near the polar regions , there are only two seasons: winter and summer. In winter, nights are long. For more than two months you can't see the sun. In summer, days are long and the sun is always in the sky. There are no nights. The people living near the North Pole are called Inuit . In summer they live in tents and catch deer for food. In winter they live in small round snow houses. They can build a snow house. They make holes in the ice and catch fish and seals . They eat much meat but not many vegetables.

After the author's father survived the heart attack, he _ .	"Four days after Dad's 67thbirthday, he had a heart attack. Luckily, he survived. But something inside him had died. His enthusiasm for life was gone. He refused to follow doctor's orders, and his sour attitude made everyone upset when they visit him. Dad was left alone. So I asked Dad to come to live with me on my small farm, hoping the fresh air would help him adjust. Within a week after he moved in, I regretted the invitation. He criticized everything I did. I became frustrated. Something had to be done. One day I read an article which said when given dogs, depressed patients would be better off. So I drove to the animal shelter that afternoon. As soon as I got there, a pointer's eyes caught my attention. They watched me calmly. A staff member said: ""He got here two weeks ago and we've heard nothing. His time is up tomorrow."" I turned to the man in horror. ""You mean you're going to kill him?"" ""Ma'am,"" he said gently. ""We don't have room for every unclaimed dog."" The police's calm brown eyes awaited my decision. ""I'll take him,"" I said. I drove home with the dog on the front seat beside me. I was helping it out of the car when Dad walked onto the front porch. ""Look what I got you!"" I said excitedly. Dad wrinkled his face. ""I don't want it,"" he muttered, turning back towards the house. Then, suddenly, the dog pulled free from my grasp. He sat down in front of my Dad. Dad's anger melted, and soon he was hugging the dog. This was the beginning of a warm friendship. Dad named the dog Cheyenne. Together they spent long hours walking down dusty lanes and relaxing on the banks of streams. Dad's bitterness faded, and he and Cheyenne went on to make many friends. Then, late one night two years later, I felt Cheyenne's cold nose burrowing through my bed covers. He had never before come into my bedroom at night. I ran into my father's room and found that he had passed away. Two days later, my shock and grief deepened when I discovered Cheyenne lying dead beside Dad's bed. As I buried him near their favorite stream, I silently thanked the dog for restoring Dad's peace of mind."	['became unpleasant toward other people']
Which headline of the following is the best for this passage?	"Books which give instructions on how to do things are very popular in the United States today. Thousands of these ""How to"" books are available; in fact, there are about four thousand books with titles that begin with the words ""How to"". One book may tell you how to earn more money, another may tell you how to save or spend it, and another may explain how to give your money away. Many ""How to"" books give advice on careers . They tell you how to choose a career and how to succeed at it. If you fail, however, you can buy a book called ""How to Turn Failure into Success"". If you would like to become very rich, you can buy the book ""How to Make a Million"". If you never make any money at all, you may need a book called ""How to Live on Nothing?"" One of the most popular types of books is one that helps you with personal problems. If you want to have a better love of life, you can read ""How to Succeed at Love Every Minute of Your Life?"". If you are tired of books on happiness, you may prefer a book called ""How to Make Yourself miserable?"". Many of these books help people use their time better. Some people want books which will give them useful information about sports, hobbies, and travel. Other people use their free time to make repairs and improvements on their homes. They prefer books which give step by step instruction on how to repair things like plumbing and electrical wiring, or on how to redecorate or enlarge a house.

Which of the following is true?	"Ted Brown's dream as a child was an unusual one: he wanted to fly. What was more unusual was the way in which he made his dream come true. After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his ""plane"". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them. At last, Ted gathered his courage to shoot a few balloons and slowly landed on the ground, where many policemen were waiting for him. Ted made his dream come true, but it cost him: he was fined $ 1,500 for breaking the law about air safety. When asked by a reporter why he had done it, Ted answered, ""A man can't just sit around and do nothing; he should have his dream and go for it.

Which of the following is one of the features of braggarts?	"According to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal, we might all be braggarts in this competitive society addicted to social networking. Take a close look at your socialnetworking sites. Do you like to post photos of yourself in restaurants to show others what an exciting life you have? Or do you like to write about how happily in love you are? Or perhaps you are of the subtle type who constantly complain about jobs but really just want to impress others with your important position. According to the results of a series of experiments conducted by Harvard University neuroscientists , the reward areas of our brain----the same areas that respond to ""primary rewards"" such as food ----are activated when we talk about ourselves. We devote between 30 to 40 percent of our conversation time to doing just that. Unfortunately, Bernstein says, some people can't tell the difference between sharing positive information that others might actually want to know and direct bragging. She suggests that bragging involves comparison, whether stated or implied. ""We are expected to be perfect all the time. The result is that more and more people are carefully managing their online images"". says Elizabeth Bernstein, a columnist with the Wall Street Journal. But the issue is not limited to the Internet. In a fiercely competitive job market we must sell ourselves on multiple platforms and show that we are better than others. In fact, we have become so accustomed to bragging that we don't even realize we are doing it, says Bernstein. This is harmful to our relationships and puts people off. Bernstein talked to some experts who said that people brag for all sorts of reasons: to appear worthy of attention; to prove to ourselves we are doing fine and that people who said we would fail are wrong; or simply because we're excited when good things happen to us. ""Feel sorry for them, because they're doing this unconscious, destructive thing that won't help them in the long run,"" said Professor Simian Valier, a research psychologist at Washington University."

Each night I watched him. As the passengers got on the bus, he smiled at each one. It was fun to see how many passengers forgot their troubles and smiled back. There was one passenger, I noticed, that had never smiled back. He usually coughed roughly through his mustache as he got on the bus. And he never covered his mouth. But that wasn't enough to stop the bus driver's smile. He gave the man with the mustache and the rough cough his biggest smile. The man with the mustache never seemed to see that smile. He would sit on the edge of his seat and complained about the way that the bus driver was driving. He only complained for a short time, but he spoke loudly enough so everybody could hear. It was enough to make me sick. But the driver never said a word. He just went on smiling at passengers as they got on the bus. I wanted to get to know this bus driver better. One night I stayed on the bus to the end of the line. I asked the driver, ""Why don't you throw that man with the mustache out of the bus?""

According to the passage, when should a marathon runner begin his training?	Running a marathon Have you ever taken part in a marathon? A marathon is 42km long. It is the longest race in the world. To make the runner's body work, harder training is quite necessary. A runner should start to prepare for a marathon at least three months before. Preparation may have races, many hours of running at different speeds and changes in diet . During the training time the runner must eat a fit diet. The diet should have lots of things needed in training the players. In the early days of training, runners run 80km per week. The running is increased every two or three weeks and at least two long runs per week are needed. Two weeks before the marathon, the training programme becomes less, from 100km per week down to 60km and then to 30km in the final week. On the last two days they may not run at all. Breakfast should be eaten at least three hours before the race. Easily digested food such as cereal , toast and scrambled egg is best, with as much fluid as possible. Runners should drink water about half an hour before the race to keep up the body fluid.	['Three or four months before the race.']

What CAN'T Father get through his hard work?	FFather was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes,hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better. paid job. Except. for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely. Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing,fine food and vacation abroad. However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager.

Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium. Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients. Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions.

"What does the phrase ""he sees red"" mean in this passage?"	Dear Annie, I have never written a letter to a newspaper before, I have just never felt the need to do such a thing. I have always felt I was quite able to do everything by myself. But now I know I was wrong. Sometimes you really need help in life, I guess. And that's why I'm writing this letter to you. I have a happy family. I love my children and they love me . I'm a mother of three children. I know well how to bring up children, and two of them are already over twenty, so it is nothing new for me. But now I have a serious problem: the Internet problem. My little son is just sixteen, and I feel he should do a lot of homework now , but he doesn't seem to be interested in it . He can happily spend six or eight hours at a time on the Internet every day , He chats with people that he has never met before , but speaks little to us .He does lots of useless things on the Internet. And he sees red if you ask him to do his homework. I just want him to be a good student . Now he seldom does his lessons at home. I'm afraid he will drop behind in his class soon. His father is a doctor , a very kind man . He never seems to be afraid of his father. What can I do ?And don't tell to talk to him. We've tried that and it didn't work. But this is really a big problem in our family. I have tried everything I can think of . I wonder how the Internet is so attractive .You're my last hope. Please tell me what I can do! Yours, Ellen Smith	['He becomes angry']
Which is the following sentences is Right	In China, safety education is becoming more and more important now. The last Monday in March is for students to learn it at school. It helps students learn more about what they should do to keep themselves safe. What are the accidents at school? Take a look. Stampedes , earthquakes and fires are the main accidents at school. A stampede always happens in crowded places. When students around you begin to push, just stand there and try to hold onto something. If you fall down in the crowd, move to one side and protect your head with your hands around. When earthquakes happen, you can get under a desk quickly and hold on. It'll protect you from falling things. If you are outdoors, find a place away from buildings, trees, and power lines. When there's a fire, leave the classroom quickly. It's better to put something wet over your mouth and nose. In this way, you won't breathe in smoke. Many people die in a fire, not because of the fire but smoke. It makes them cough and they can't breathe. That's very dangerous! So when you want to get out, you should make yourself close to the floor. Then you can breathe some fresh air.
