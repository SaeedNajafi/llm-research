Why do children want to eat unhealthy food in front of the television?	"What you see is what you eat, according to the latest study to confirm that watching TV encourages children to eat more junk food. But the researchers say there may be an easy way to stop unhealthy snacking in front of the television: put healthier food within easy reach. Leah Lipsky and Ronal Iannotti are the scientists who worked on the study, which was reported this week in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. The report says that for every hour of television children watch, they are 8% less likely to eat fruit every day, 18% more likely to eat candy, and 16% more likely to eat fast food. The reasons for the link between watching TV and eating junk food aren't surprising: young people watching TV are exposed to more advertising for unhealthy food-such as fast food-than commercials for fresh fruit and vegetables. Studies show that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to prefer eating things that are high in sugar, salt and fat, even when they aren't watching TV. The researchers also found that some children who snacked in front of the television, however, increased the amount of fruit that they ate. It all depended on what was available and within reach. "" _ ,"" says Lipsky. ""But it suggests that if you have other choices available-and don't have the unhealthy choices available-then children might be encouraged to eat more fruit."" Lipsky and Iannotti also recommend that parents _ the amount of time that children spend in front of a TV or computer-no more than two hours a day for children over two years old."

What is the writing purpose of the article?	"Busy senior managers need no longer waste time in showering themselves-an Australian company has invented a suit that can be worn while they wash. The suit has been specially designed so that it can be cleaned under the showerhead. There is no need for soaking ,dry cleaning-or even soap. The Japanese market has taken a liking to the ""shower suit"",described as ""revolutionary"" by its owner Australian Wool Innovation (AWI),which is the research and marketing body that represents Australian wool-growers. Orders have been placed for 170,000 of the woolen suits. The suit could be worn in the shower,although it was probably better to hang it on a clothes hanger and carry it instead,AWI corporate affairs spokesman Stephen Feighan said.""The idea is that you hang it up and then...you give it a spray ,and it's dry the next morning,"" Mr Feighan said. A Japanese researcher working for AWI invented the suit by combining three technologies. The secret is the best lining ,which allows the suit to dry quickly.The shower suit attracted busy corporate people,particularly those who often traveled or stayed up late,Mr Feighan said.The airline industry was also interested. Mr Feighan confessed he had not worn one of the suits yet,or tried to wash it in the shower,because they cut to fit Japanese figures.AWI believes that the shower suit will spread from the Japanese market through Europe and India. Mr Feighan hoped the suit,made from local wool,would be available in Australia in 12 to 18 months' time."	['To introduce a newly-designed shower suit.']

What happened to the donkey at last?	"A man had a little dog, and he was very fond of it. He would pat its head, and take it on his knee, and talk to it. Then he would give it little bits of food from his own plate. A donkey looked in at the window and saw the man and the dog. ""Why does he not make a pet of me?"" said the donkey. ""It is not fair. I work hard, and the dog only wags its tail, and barks, and jumps on its master's knee. It is not fair."" Then the donkey said to himself, ""If I do what the dog does, he may make a pet of me."" So the donkey ran into the room. It brayed as loudly as it could. It wagged its tail so hard that it knocked over a jar on the table. Then it tried to jump on to its master's knee. The master thought the donkey was mad, and he shouted, ""Help! Help!"" Men came running in with sticks, and they beat the donkey till it ran out of the house, and they drove it back to the field.

In Australia, you can spend Christmas _ .	"Studying abroad is an amazing experience, especially when you come to Australia as an overseas( ) high school student. You can have a lot of fun here, especially on holidays. There are many festivals in Australia. The most important one is obviously Christmas. Each year, the summer holidays at every high school last about two months from the beginning of December to February, which covers the Christmas time. Since it is a long holiday, most overseas students love to fly back to their home countries to spend the time with their families and friends, but a few students still stay in Australia during the holiday to get part-time jobs. It is quite easy to find a part-time job at Christmas. Students often take part in another major social activity. They go to the beach to have fun in the sunshine. The summer in Australia is from December to February, so going to the beach in December is very popular among Australians. Easter in March is another important holiday in the year. It actually combines ""Good Friday"" and ""Easter Monday"". Almost every shop closes on Good Friday. And people usually go to see Easter Show. The Chinese New year is not a public holiday in Australia, so every Chinese student still has to go to school to study and do his or her normal duties."	['in summer']
Why did John go into the flower shop?	"John had been on a business trip for three weeks. It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. ""How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?"" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . ""No, I have to have roses,"" he said, ""My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite."" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, ""Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars."" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, ""Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her."" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally."	['He decided to order some roses.']
The passage suggests that _ .	"In 1883. John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However, bridge building experts throughout the world thought this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea, but Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. ""We told them so."" ""Crazy men and their crazy dreams.'' ""It's foolish to chase wild visions."" Evcryone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap, Washington was never discouraged. One day he was lying on his bed in hospital, seeing the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment with the sunlight streaming through the windows, and a gentle breeze bowing the flimsy white curtains apart when an idea hit him. He decided to make the best use of the only finger he could move. Thus, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm until the bridge was finally completed."

When the stomach is out of balance, _ .	"Tui Na and Your Emotional Health In Traditional Chinese Medicine the body, mind and spirit cannot be divided and so the unique whole-body treatment in Tui Na can also be a useful treatment correcting any imbalances in the body's energy before symptoms and disease can develop. It also works to restore emotional harmony as well as physical health. This is why after a Tui Na treatment many people ""feel good"". Many people in China use Tui Na regularly to keep healthy and to deal with some specific illnesses. Tui Na is performed on the clothed body and the patient is either lying on a couch or sitting on a chair. Therapists using a variety of strokes or movements will control the intensity and direction of pressure in an exact way. The unique rolling movement in Tui Na is one of the most difficult strokes to learn and students have to practice sometimes for many months on a rice bag before they are allowed to practice on the human body. Stress Tui Na is of course very useful for treating stress. It distributes the energy around the whole body. It is believed that Tui Na moves the strong energy in the tense muscles to the weaker areas, thus making a more balanced body. When your Qi (energy in the body) flow is balanced you feel relaxed and comfortable. Tui Na is especially useful for stiff shoulders and tense neck muscles. Emotions In Traditional Chinese Medicine each major organ is linked to an emotion. By balancing the energy in the organ, the relevant emotion will be calmed. When your emotions are out of control, you would usually turn to your doctor or perhaps a psychotherapist. But perhaps some people would not like to be seeing a psychotherapist or feel nervous about discussing their problems with others. With Tui Na one does not need to tell the therapist anything one does not want to. The treatment of Tui Na can deal with the problem itself -- although if one does need to talk, then the safe space is there to do so. An active dialogue between the therapist and the patient will help to get a better effect. How the major organs rule your emotions Each major organ -- the heart, the stomach, the spleen, the liver, the bladder, the kidneys, the lungs, etc. -- is linked to a relevant emotion. The heart is linked to joy, excitement and sadness. If the heart is out of balance, the patient may dream a lot at night and often forget something important in the day. The stomach and spleen are connected with too much thinking or worrying -- over anxiety. When the stomach is out of balance there is often a lack of energy. The patient often feels very tired and has no interest in doing anything at all. The liver and gall bladder are linked to anger. In Chinese Medicine the eyes are connected with the liver, and many people who suffer from anger often suffer from eye problems. The gall bladder rules decision-making and too much energy here can lead to rashness, while if there is too little it can bring about indecision. Where there is a history of depression, the therapist would look to the liver. The bladder and kidneys are linked to fear of all kinds, from simple anxieties and phobias to vague fears and worries. The lungs are connected with feelings of grief and sadness. When there is a history of grief, the therapist would look to the lungs. Tui Na is used in almost all the hospitals in China and very popular among Chinese people. It is a useful and valuable method of restoring Qi balance, when emotional and physical health is out of balance. Tui Na is one of the remaining secrets of Chinese Medicine."

The woman successfully grew the white marigold at last because she _ .	One year, a college in the Unites States announced that it would offer a lot of money for the pure white marigold . The high reward attracted so many people, but in the nature, besides golden, the marigold is brown, and it is not easy to get the white one. So after they were excited for a time, many people had forgotten the announcement. One normal day after 20 years, the college received a letter and 100 seeds of pure white marigold. It turned out to be an old woman of over 70 years old. Some experts in the college doubted it , but in order not to let her down, those seeds finally took root in the earth. The miracle appeared after one year: the field was covered by pure white marigold. Therefore, the old woman who was always unknown to the public became a new _ . The old woman was a flower-lover. When she read the announcement 20 years ago, she got very excited like others. But her right children were totally against her decision. After all, a woman who never knew the seed genetics couldn't complete what the experts could never do, so her thought was only a day dream. Still, the old woman didn't change her mind and went on working. She planted some of the most common seeds and took good care of them. A year later, when the marigold came out, she chose one faintest from those golden and brown flowers and get the best seed. The next year, she again grew them and chose.... Day after day, year after year, through many seasons, the old woman's husband died, her children flew far and high, a lot of things happened in her life, but only the desire to grow the pure white marigold took root in her heart. Finally, after 20 years on the day we all know, in the garden she saw a marigold which was not nearly white, but as white as sliver or snow. A problem even experts couldn't deal with was solved by an old woman who didn't understand genetics. Wasn't it a miracle? To take root in the heart, even the most common seed can grow into a miracle!

The author mentioned the women on the Titanic to _ .	"Too many people put off things that could bring them joy just because they haven't thought about them, don't have them on their schedules or are too stubborn to leave from their regular daily things. One day I thought about all those women on the Titanic who refused sweet foods at dinner that fateful night to cut out fatty foods. From then on, I've tried to be a little more changeable. I cannot count the times I called my sister and said, ""How about going to lunch in half an hour?"" She would stammer ,""I can't , I have clothes to wash. My hair is dirty. I wish I had known yesterday. I had a late breakfast. It looks like rain."" She died a few years ago. We never did have lunch together. We live on promises we make to ourselves when all the conditions are perfect. We'll go back and visit the grandparents when we get our baby, Stevie, toilet-trained. We'll enjoy when we replace the living room carpet. We'll go on a second honeymoon when we get two more kids out of college. Life has a way _ as we get older. The days get shorter, and the list of promises to ourselves gets longer. One morning, we wake up, and all we have to show for our lives is a long list of ""I'm going to"", ""I plan on"" and ""Someday, when things settle down a bit"". I love ice cream. But my lips had not touched ice cream in 10 years. The other day I stopped the car and bought an ice cream. If my car had hit an iceberg on the way home, I would have died happy. Now, go have a nice day. Do something you want to. If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you say? And why are you waiting?"

"One may say ""It tastes just like chicken."" when _ ."	"it tastes just chicken Away from home, eating is more than just a way to keep your stomach full.It is a language all its own, and no words can say, ""Glad to meet you ...glad to be doing business with you ..."" quite like sharing a meal offered by your host. Clearly, mealtime is not the time for you to say, ""Thanks, but no thanks."" Acceptance of the food on your plate means acceptance of host, country, and company.So, no matter how difficult it may be to swallow, swallow.Or, as one experienced traveler says, ""Travel with a cast-iron stomach and eat everything everywhere."" Often, the food offered represents proudly your host country's eating culture.What would Ataiericans think of a French person who refused to take a bite of homemade apple pie or sirloin? Our discomfort comes not so much from the thing itself; it comes from our umamiliarity with it.After all, an oyster has remarkably the same look as a sheep's eye; and a first look at a lobster would remind almost anybody of a creature from a science fiction movie, not something you dip in butter and eat.By the way, in Saudi Arabia sheep's eyes are a famous dish and in parts of China it's bear's paw soup. Can you refuse such food without being rude? Most experienced business travelers say no, at least not before taking at least a few bites.It helps, though, to slice any item very thin.This way, you minimize the taste and the reminder of where it came from.Or, "" Swallow it quickly, "" as one traveler recommends.""I still can't tell you what sheep's eyeballs taste like."" As for dealing with taste, the old line that ""it tastes just like chicken"" is often thankfully true.Even when the ""it"" is really rat or snake. Another useful piece of advice is not knowing what you are eating.What's for dinner? Don't ask. Avoid glancing into the kitchen or looking at English-language menus.Your host will be pleased that you are eating the food he offers, and who knows? Maybe it really is chicken in that soup."

The best title for the passage is _ .	"Once upon a time, people wrote letters mostly with pen and paper. But the Internet has changed all that. Among computer users today, between 50 and 90 percent of written letters take place through e-mail. That's much different from the days when everyone relied on ""snail mail"" . More and more new e-mail users are asking, ""How can I write better e-mail message?"" Here are six tips for you. (1) Who are you writing to? Who are you writing to? A friend, a classmate, a teacher or a boss? Be sure the tone of your e-mail message is right for the receiver. Using slang or abbreviations may be all right for your friends. But business letters should use full names and complete sentences. (2) Be direct. Readers of e-mail have little patience. Say what you want to say directly. (3) Use short sentences. E-mail is quicker and more convenient than snail mail. It's also much easier to throw away. Don't use long sentences. Make your sentences short and clear. (4) Give enough details . A terrible e-mail message reads like this: ""Did you get my e-mail?"" Someone reading this will wonder, ""Which e-mail? Sent when? About what?"" Today's e-mail users sometimes get many messages every day, so be sure your messages have enough details to be understood. (5) Use the subject line well Readers see what's in the subject line of your message before anything else. Don't say ""Hi, from Wang Peng""------ they can see who sent the message from the address. A short, direct explanation of the content of your message will get you a faster answer. (6) Don't be too slow to answer. Remember that in the world of e-mail, things happen fast. If you take longer than a week to answer someone's message, it may be too late."	['How To Write A Better E-mail']

Which of the following can best describe Sun?	"Lee's mother Sun became unexpectedly pregnant while married to a disabled man. Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life. When Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea. Lee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances. Her first album titled ""Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers"" was released in June, 2008. Lee speaks highly of her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, ""As time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend."""

According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?	"When Xia Min started drinking alcohol(,) with her classmates at a friend's birthday, she didn't realize what would happen to her. She drank a lot and fell into a coma . The 15year-old girl from Chongqing never recovered. Xia's death is warning to other students. A new rule went into effect on January 1, 2006. Teens are not allowed to buy or drink alcohol. Shops are not allowed to sell it to them. A 1999 Chinese law forbade shops to sell alcohol to youths under 18. But _ is not taken seriously by shopkeepers because it doesn't have specific rules. People hope the new rule will work. ""I tasted alcohol when having the dinner of the last New Year's Eve,"" said Lian Yuqi, a 16-year-old girl in Xiamen. She believes that the new rule will stop teens from drinking and help them grow in a healthy way. ""Although it may be a little disappointing not to have beer at parties, I think we can have soft drinks instead,"" she said."	['Shopkeepers can sell alcohol to teens above 18.']
The author uses power walking as an example mainly because _ .	"Sports can help you keep fit and get in touch with nature.However,whether you are on the mountains,in the waves,or on the grassland,you should be aware that your sport of choice might have great influence on the environment. Some sports are resource-hungry.Golf,as you may know,eats up not only large areas of countryside,but also tons of water.Besides,all sorts of chemicals and huge amounts of energy are used to keep its courses in good condition.This causes major environmental effects.For example,in the dry regions of Portugal and Spain,golf is often held responsible for serious water shortage in some local areas. There are many environment-friendly sports.Power walking is one of them that you could take up today.You don't need any special equipment except a good pair of shoes;and you don't have to worry about resources and your purse.Simple and free,power walking can also keep you fit.If you walk regularly,it will be good for your heart and bones.Experts say that 20 minutes of power walking daily can make you feel less anxious,sleep well and have better weight control. Whatever sport you take up,you can make it greener by using environment-friendly equipment and buying products made from recycled materials.But the final goal should be""green gyms"".They RYe better replacements for traditional health clubs and modern sports centers. Members of green gyms play sports outdoors,in the countryside or other open spaces.There is no special requirement for you to start your membership.And best of all,it's free."

What is the fourth advice meant to tell us?	"We can't help but grow older physically, but we can stay young in other ways. Do you want to stay young? If yes is the answer, here is what you can do: 1. _ . This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her. 2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down. 3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop."" 4.Enjoy the simple things. When the children are young, that is all that you can afford. When they are in college, that is all you can afford. When you are on retirement, that is all you can afford! 5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter. 6. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, or hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge. 7. Value your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help. 8. The tears happen. Endure sorrow, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive. 9. At every opportunity, tell the people you love that you love them."	"[""We needn't worry about the children and our late life.""]"
After Philip explained his new life, _ .	"Philip was a nine-year-old boy in a Sunday school class of 8-year-old girls and boys. Sometimes the third graders didn't welcome Philip into their group and usually tricked him. This was not because he was older, but because he was ""different"". You see, Philip suffered from a _ called Downs's Syndrome. This made him ""different"", with his facial characteristics, slow responses and mental problems. One Sunday after Easter, the Sunday school teacher gathered some plastic eggs that pulled apart in the middle. The teacher gave one to each child. On that beautiful spring day, the children were to go out and discover for themselves some symbol of ""new life"" and place it inside the plastic eggs. After the children returned to the classroom, the teacher opened their eggs one by one, asking each child to explain that symbol of ""new life"". The first opened egg contained a flower. Everyone cheered. In another was a butterfly.... When the teacher opened the last egg, it was empty. ""That's stupid,"" said someone. The teacher felt a pull at his shirt. It was Philip. Looking up, Philip said, ""It's mine. I did it. It's empty. I have new life, because the tomb is empty."" Not a sound was heard in class at all. From that day on, Philip became a real part of the group. They welcomed him, and whatever made him different was never mentioned again. Philip's family knew he wouldn't live a long life, for there were too many things wrong with him."	['The class fell silent.']
The CV has become such an important document because _ .	"There is a new type of small advertisement becoming increasingly common in newspaper classified columns.It is sometimes placed among ""situations vacant"", although it does not offer anyone a job, and sometimes it appears among ""situations wanted"", although it is not placed by someone looking for a job, either.What it does is to offer help in applying for a job. ""Contact us before writing your application"", or ""Make use of our long experience in preparing your curriculum vitae or job history"", is how it is usually expressed.The growth and apparent success of such a specialized service is, of course, a reflection on the current high levels of unemployment.It is also an indication of the growing importance of the CV, with the suggestion that it may now qualify as an art form in its own right. There was a time when job seekers simply wrote letters of application.""Just put down your name, address, age and whether you have passed any exams"", was about the average level of advice offered to young people applying for their first jobs when I left school.The letter was really just for openers, it was explained, everything else could and should be saved for the interview.And in those days of full employment the technique worked.The letter proved that you could write and were available for work.Your eager face and intelligent replies did the rest. There is no doubt, however, that it is increasing number of applicants with university education at all points in the process of engaging staff that has led to the greater importance of the CV."

The author intends to _ .	Many children first learn the value of money by receiving an allowance. The purpose is to let children learn from experience at an age when financial mistakes are not very costly. The amount of money that parents give to their children to spend as they wish differs from family to family. Timing is another consideration. Some children get a weekly allowance. Others get a monthly allowance. In any case, parents should make clear what, if anything, the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this, they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget. Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Older children may be responsible enough to save money for larger costs, like clothing or electronics. Allowances give children a chance to experience the things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save and maybe even invest it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice: you have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer services to help children and teenagers learn about personal finance. A savings account is an excellent way to learn about the power of compound interest . That may not seem like a lot. But over time it adds up.	"[""make parents aware of the children's allowances""]"
What do most people think of the changes in American schools?	American schools do not have separate classes for boys and girls. If boys want to cook or to sew, they can learn these things in classes that are no longer just for girls. If girls want to repair cars, they can now learn this in school. Most students like to have boys and girls on the same baseball team. Many boys and girls dress alike in school. They were blue jeans and sport shirts. Some have long hair and some have short hair. Sometimes a boy has longer hair than a girl. Even the language is different. Students learn to say fire fighter instead of fireman, police officer instead of policeman, and letter carrier instead of mailman. A person does not need to be a man to fight a fire or to deliver the mail. Most people think that these changes are good. They give all people an equal chance to be happy and to do what they want to do with their lives. Fathers like to tell their sons that they can grow up to be president. Today, mothers can tell the same things to there daughters.	['Good']
Which of the following can be used to describe Sarah's story?	"It was the first day of second grade, and Sarah had been looking forward to this moment. The night before, she laid out her favorite clothes: a white coat and a bright yellow shirt. When having breakfast, Sarah dropped some food on her shirt, so she had to change into her second-best clothes, blue jeans and a Jonas Brothers T-shirt. After breakfast Sarah rushed to catch the school bus and when she was just reaching the door the bus driver opened it. The door hit right in Sarah's face and blood dripped from her nose. The driver wanted to send her home, but she refused, ""It is the most important day of the year! I can't miss it!"" Before classes, Sarah went to her favorite swing. When rising high, she saw her best friend little Jack. She let go of the swing and waved to him with one hand. Unfortunately, she flew out of the swing and landed hard on the sand, breaking a leg and an arm. As she lay in the sand, she noticed a shiny thing on the ground beside her. With her good hand she took it. When Sarah' mother rushed into the ward she was surprised by what she saw: her girl was lying in bed with an arm and a leg in the splint , a broken nose, and blood stains on her second-best clothes. Expecting to see her child crying, she was confused when she saw a big, bright smile on Sarah's face. ""Sarah, look at you!"" her mother cried. ""You were hurt so badly and why are you smiling?"" ""Look, Mommy, I found a diamond!"" Sarah laughed. Life can be like that. It can be tough, even painful sometimes. But there are always treasures that make the pain worth suffering."

In order to raise the efficiency of the water supply, measures should be taken to _ .	Humanity uses a little less than half the water available worldwide. Yet occurrences of shortages and droughts are causing famine and distress in some areas, and industrial and agricultural by-products are polluting water supplies. Since the world's population is expected to double in the next 50 years, many experts think we are on the edge of a widespread water crisis. But that doesn't have to be the outcome. Water shortages do not have to trouble the world---if we start valuing water more than we did in the past. Just as we began to appreciate petroleum more after the 1970s oil crises, today we must start looking at water from a fresh economic perspective. We can no longer afford to consider water a virtually free resource of which we can use as much as we like in any way we want. Instead, for all uses except the domestic demand of the poor, governments should price water to reflect its actual value. This means charging a fee for the water itself as well as for the supply costs. Governments should also protect this resource by providing water in more economically and environmentally sound ways. For example, often the cheapest way to provide irrigation water in the dry tropics is through small-scale projects, such as gathering rainfall in depressions and pumping it to nearby cropland. No matter what steps governments take to provide water more efficiently, they must change their institutional and legal approaches to water use. Rather than spread control among hundreds or even thousands of local, regional, and national agencies that watch various aspects of water use, countries should set up central authorities to coordinate water policy.

What is the best title for the passage?	Nowadays many young people want to make money by making video games. Creating a good game often needs a lot of game developers. The graphic designers, the programmers, writing and music are all important to the final product. With the development of the Internet, _ games become more and more popular. In the past, if people wanted to play games together, they had to be in the same place. But now people in different cities, countries or even living on opposite sides of the world can play computer games together. Some people think video games are good. Playing games makes them very happy. Others think video games are bad. Some children spend a lot of time playing games, so they have little time to do sports. Playing games may cause the overexposure to violence.	['Video games']
It was in Paris that Alice Waters _ .	"It was 1963, in Paris. While walking through the fruit and vegetable market Alice Waters was struck by the display of brilliant color1s, the music of farmers selling their produce, and in the middle of a great city. She felt ""directly connected to the land."" Chez Panisse, a Berkeley restaurant, which was founded upon Waters' ecological philosophy, has been named ""The Best Restaurant in America"" by both the James Beard Foundation and by Gourmet magazine, many times in the past. Only the food grown in accordance with the principles of sustainable agriculture was used in the restaurant. Menus offered nightly at Chez Panisse have consisted only of fresh ingredients, harvested in season, and purchased from local farmers. Alice Waters has successfully demonstrated how a restaurant can develop successfully while contributing to the general welfare of the farming community. Sharing a meal between the people was one of the wishes of Alice Waters as she would love her customers to know each other. In 1996, inspired by the Garden Project at the San Francisco County Jail , Waters decided to apply her principles to education. The project was first started at the Martin Luther King Middle School in Berkeley with the idea to transform some land near the school into a garden and, in the process, to teach local school children about food and agriculture. In 1999, over 120 people came to help plant the first cover crop, which prepared the field for farming by adding nutrients to the soil. The student garden staff has had several years' worth of harvest, and has started growing gardens like herb and tea. Here, agricultural practices are continually being revised and updated and every year the Schoolyard staff attends the Ecological Farming Conference in Monterey. A kitchen classroom has also been created, where students learn about main foods eaten in other parts of the world. ""I believe that every child in this world needs to have a relationship with the land...to know how to nourish themselves...and to know how to connect with the community around them,"" says Waters. The middle school has become a model in itself. The students work the land and harvest the crops, while the cafeteria buys and prepares the produce for school lunches. This program will go a long way in teaching kids to value fresh food and their own contributions. This project is sure to inspire a national change in school curricula . In fact, many middle and high schools in California and Ohio have launched similar projects. In 1997, Alice Waters received the Humanitarian Award from the James Beard Foundation in recognition of her dedication and contribution towards environment. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education Secretary, Richard Riley, honored her with a John H. Stanford ""Education Hero"" award."	['took a fancy to a unique food culture']
Many people plan to go to Pic de Bugarach mainly because _ .	"FRANCE has destroyed the hopes of those who had planned to take refuge in one of the few places on Earth which some believe will be spared when the world ends on December 21 .Local officials banned access to the Pic de Bugarach,a mountain in the southwest where rumor has it that the hilltop will open on the last day and aliens will appear with spaceships to save nearby humans. Eric Freysselinard,the state's top representative in the area,said he was blocking access to the mountain for public safety reasons to avoid a rush of New Age fanatics ,sight-seers and media crews. Believers say the world will end on December 21,2012,the end date of the ancient Mayan calendar,and they see Bugarach as one of a few sacred mountains sheltered from the cataclysm . Mr Freysselinard said the 100 police and firefighters will also control approaches to the tiny village of the same name at the foot of the mountain,and if too many people turn up,they will block access there too.""We are expecting a few people who believe in this end of the world,but in extremely limited numbers,"" he said in the. nearby city of Carcassonne.""We are expecting greater numbers of people who are just curious,but in numbers we cannot determine. Above all,we are expecting lots of journalists,""he said. Films,documentaries and websites have promoted the idea that the ancient Mayan calendar predicts that doomsday is on December 21.The culture ministry in Guatemala-where half the population are of Mayan descent-is hosting a massive event in the capital just in case the world actually does end,while tour groups are promoting doomsday-themed getaways."

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to passage?	First aid is the aid or the help which can be given to an injured person first, that is, before any other help comes. Nowadays there is usually a telephone not far away and the first we should do, if a serious accident happens, call the phone for an ambulance. Sometimes our quick action may save someone's life. Shock. People often suffer from shock after receiving an injury, sometimes even when the injury is very tiny. The face turns grey, and the skin becomes damp and cold. They breathe quickly. They should be kept warm. Cover them with a blanket and give them a warm drink. Broken bones. Do not move the patient. Send for an ambulance at once. Bleeding. A little bleeding doesn't harm. It washes dirt from the wound. But if the bleeding continues, try to stop it by placing a clean cloth firmly over the wound until the bleeding stops or helps arrive. Poison. A person who has taken poison should be taken to a hospital at once. With some poisons, sleeping pills, for example, it is a good thing to make the patient throw up by pressing your fingers down his throat. Remember: When an accident happens, send someone to telephone for an ambulance at once. Keep the injured person warm and quiet. Give him plenty of air. Do not let other people crowd around him.

A future car will have all the following features EXCEPT _ .	"Have you ever imagined what kind of car we will be driving in 2020? It will be rather different from the type we know today, with the next 20 years bringing greater change than the past 50. The people who will be designing the models of tomorrow believe that environmental problems may well accelerate(,)the pace of the car's development. Today they are students on the transport design course at London's Royal College of Art. Their vision is of a machine with three wheels instead of four, electrically powered, environmentally clean, and able to drive itself along ""intelligent"" roads equipped with built-in power supplies. Future cars will pick up their fuel during long journeys from a power source built into the road, or store it in small quantities for traveling in the city. Instead of today's seating arrangements--two in front, two or three behind, all facing forward--the 2010 car will have a versatile interior with adults and children in a family circle. This view of the future car is based on a much more sophisticated road system, _ Cars will not need drivers, because computers will provide safe driving control and route finding. All the driver will have to do is to say where to go and the computer will do the rest. It will become impossible for cars to crash into one another. The technology already exists for the car to become a true automobile."	['running without anyone in it']
The author thought of his friend's question as a good one because _ .	"A friend of mine, in response to a conversation we were having about the injustices of life, asked me the question: ""Who said life was going to be fair, or that it was even meant to be fair?"" Her question was a good one. It reminded me of something I was taught as a youngster-life isn't fair. One of the mistakes many of us make is that we feel sorry for ourselves or for others, thinking that life should be fair or that someday it will be. It's not and it won't. One of the nice things about accepting the fact that life isn't fair is that it keeps us from feeling sorry for ourselves by encouraging us to do the very best we can with what we have. Accepting this fact also keeps us from feeling sorry for others because we are reminded that everyone is dealt a different hand; everyone has unique strengths and problems in the process of growing up, facing the reality and making decisions, and everyone has those times that they feel wounded or unfairly treated. The fact that life isn't fair doesn't mean we shouldn't do everything in our power to improve our own lives or the world as a whole. On the contrary, it suggests that we should. When we don't recognize or admit life isn't fair, we tend to feel pity for others and for ourselves, a self-defeating emotion that does nothing except make everyone feel worse. When we do recognize life isn't fair, however, we feel sympathy for others and for ourselves. And sympathy is a heartfelt emotion that delivers loving kindness to everyone it touches. The next time you find yourself thinking about the injustices of the world, try reminding yourself of _ . You may be surprised that it can push you out of self-pity and into helpful action."

"The writer thinks the campaign ""Eat up All on Your Plate"" makes sense because _ ."	"The message what the ""Eat up All on Your Plate"" campaign tries to convey is not new. Our ancestorshad poems about the importance of frugality in the consumption of food. But it makes a lot of sensewhen many are yet to have the awareness that food waste borders on a crime. The campaign has been started online and thousands of people have answered the call. Manyrestaurants have joined the program by announcing that customers are encouraged to order half a dish andtake home what they can't finish. However, it is estimated that 50 million tons of grain are wasted every year in China, enough tofeed 200 million people for a year. True, official banquets paid with public money contribute much to such waste. But it isimportant that everyone thinks about how they can do their bit to reduce food waste. We need to developthe habit of never ordering or cooking more than we can eat and feeling guilty when we dump ourleftovers. Many people have a bad habit of entertaining guests with more than enough food, believing that theyhave not satisfied their guests' appetites if there is no food left on the table. In fact, to be a good host theyorder more than their guests can possibly eat and their guests eat more than they want out of politeness. Such a mentality needs to change. People need to be made aware that it is impolite to force guests toeat more than they are comfortable with and it is insensible and uncivilized to waste food. Even if one iswealthy, ordering more than one can eat is a bad way to show off one's wealth."	['wasting food is still rather common in China']

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Next Stop: Planet Mars Fly me to the moon? That's not far enough. On September 14, 2011, NASA released designs for a superrocket, the Space Launch System (SLS). This time the final destination will be Mars. The SLS is a huge, liquid-fuelled rocket. If it is fully developed, it will be the most powerful rocket ever built. Its lift capability will be much bigger than that of the space shuttle of Saturn 5, the rocket that sent the Apollo missions to the moon. NASA is planning to launch its first unmanned test flight in 2017. It is hoped that the first crew will fly in 2021 and astronauts will make it to a nearby asteroid in 2025. NASA hopes to send the rocket and astronauts to Mars from the asteroid by the 2030s, according to the Associated Press (AP). NASA used liquid rockets to send Apollo, Gemini and Mercury into space, but later changed to solid rockets boosters because they were cheaper. Tragically, however, a booster flaw caused the space shuttle Challenger to crash in 1986. The new project plans to return to liquid fuel. According to AP, the rockets will at first be able to carry 77 to 110 tons of payload . Eventually they will be able to carry 143 tons into space, maybe even as many as 165 tons, NASA officials said. By comparison, the Saturn 5 booster could lift 130 tons and the space shuttle just 27 tons. However, unlike reusable shuttles, these powerful rockets are mostly one use only. New ones have to be built for every launch. This will be very costly. NASA estimates that it will cost about $3 billion (19 billion yuan) per year, or $18 billion until the first test flight in 2017. NASA hopes to make money by allowing private companies to send astronauts to the International Space Station like giant taxi services, so that the program can be ""sustainable"". ""This is perhaps the biggest thing for space exploration in decades,"" said Senator Bill Nelson, a former astronaut. ""The goal is to fly humans safely beyond low-Earth orbit and deep into outer space where we cannot only survive, but one day also live."""

Last week I saw the release of the second part, and _ does it shows. But watching the film as a foreigner I felt I was missing out on something. Not knowing my Cao Cao's from my Zhou Yu's, I was not even sure whom I wanted to win. Certainly after the opening scene, in which Cao Cao is seen watching a game of Cuju, an ancient Chinese variation of football, I knew who had my support. After all, any man who enjoys his football is someone after my own heart. But after Cao Cao resorted to some evil strategies against his enemies in the south, I wasn't so sure he was the man I should be rooting for. And there is a lot more toRed Cliff 2than just extravagant battle scenes. The film does not take itself too seriously. Conversations between leaders are littered with one-liners, many of which had the audience in laughter. There is even enough to keep fans of more romantic entertainment happy too. This includes a charming relationship between a southern spy and an innocent northern soldier. The characters' interaction provides some genuinely heart-warming moments in the middle of the battle. Clocking in at around two hours, the film certainly does justice to the history story. When I walked out the cinema, I felt as drained as Cao Cao's soldiers must have 1,800 years ago.

Pizzas were first made by _ .	When people think of food in the United States, they think mostly of fast foods like hamburgers and hot dogs. In fact, in the U.S. cities like New York and Los Angeles, there are thousands of different kinds of restaurants with foods from all over the world. So if you like to try different foods, the United States is the place for you. The United States has people from all over the world, and they bring with them typical foods from their countries. You can eat tempura in Japanese restaurants, tacos in Mexican restaurants, paella in Spanish restaurants, pasta in Italian restaurants, and you can also eat America's most popular food, pizza. Yes, pizza! Pizza is from Italy, but today it is an important part of the U.S. menu.

The United States has eating places for all tastes--and all pockets. You can buy a hot dog on the street and pay one or two dollars. Or you can go to a four-star restaurant and pay $200 for a dinner	['Italians']
Which might be the best title for the passage?	"As the light died out of the sky, and I watched the colour of the snow on the mountain tops change, I felt I was waking from my unhappy dream, and I began to understand how much I loved Agnes. She had been the one who had always guided and supported me, and now I realized I needed her love for the rest of my life. Had falling in love with Dora been a mistake? We had both been very young, it is true. I had always called Agnes sister, and now perhaps I no longer had the right to ask whether her love for me was more than sisterly. However, I decided to return, and travelled home to England, after three years of absence. I was delighted to find that Traddles had married his Sophy, and was doing well as a lawyer. My aunt had moved back to her old Dover house, and was living happily there with Mr.Dick and Peggotty. When I visited my aunt, I took the opportunity of asking her about Agnes. ""Has she--has she any young man she'd like to marry?"" I asked as lightly as possible. My aunt looked carefully at me as she replied, ""I suspect she has, David. She's never mentioned it to me, but I think--I feel sure she's going to marry soon."" I was firm with myself and did not show my feelings. I borrowed a horse and rode to Canterbury to ask Agnes myself. When I saw that beautiful, gentle face again, I knew I had come home. I knew how dear she was to me, and would always be. ""Agnes,"" I said, ""I am so grateful to you, for making me what I am, for helping me to be good! But I think you have a secret. Let me share it, Agnes, as your brother! Tell me whom you love!"" Agnes turned away from me and burst into tears. Somehow these tears did not sadden me, but gave me hope. ""My dear Agnes! Don't cry!"" ""David, leave me! I can't talk about it now!"" she sobbed. ""Agnes, you're dearer to me than anything in the world. Don't think I'll be jealous of any man you choose to marry. I only want you to be happy!"" She had stopped crying now and was calmer. ""If I have a secret, David, it is--not a new one. It has been my secret--for a long time!"" I was wild with hope. ""Not a new one!"" Did she mean ...? ""Dearest Agnes! Dare I hope to call you more than a sister!"" She was in my arms and sobbing again, but this time with happiness. ""I went away, Agnes, loving you! I returned home, loving you!"" We held each other for some time, sure now of each other's love. ""There is something I must tell you, David,"" she said gently, looking calmly into my face. ""I have loved you all my life!"" She added, ""And something else--before our sweet Dora died, she asked me--can you guess--to fill the empty place in your heart."" And Agnes laid her head on my shoulder, and cried. And I cried with her, although we were both so happy."	['Discovery of true love']
The family benefited a lot from the creative travel except.	"My husband, Michael, a manager of an ordinary company, came home from work one day saying, ""It's not looking good."" At midnight,I woke up seeing him sitting in a chair,his hand on his forehead. I was worried.I had to cheer him up and help ourselves financially. As an advisor for top companies and a teacher in creative thinking at the college of New Jersey for years, I thought of a good plan. What if we undertake an adventure while making money from it? As a family, we'd always talked about traveling more, but we'd been tied to routines. Now I saw no point in sitting around worrying when we could see the country. We'd take our three young kids, teach them on the road. It was the perfect time before they reached high school. We'd rent out our house. Michael disagreed at first but realized that with his cell phone, and computer, he could work anywhere. We listed our house for rent and created a brand strategy, logo, and website for us---familyofftrack.com---and persuade five companies to support us. Their ads on our site would help pay travel costs, and we'd promote their brands on our trip in exchange for their support. With everything done, we took off on April 3. All spring and summer, we visited national landmarks and treasured lands. By August when we returned home, Michael's company continued to slide and now may have to close down. But we've made the travel a permanent part of our lives. What's more, with a Chicago-based production company I've developed the Family Off Track brand by creating videos, educational programs and exhibits. And Michael has new ideas for management businesses. It's great to see the spark in his eyes again. Now I feel it even more. Together we taught our kids a lesson: Nobody ever made history by living 100 percent by the book in times of recession ."	"[""the total recovery of the father's company""]"

He was very short and he didn't play basketball very well when he joined the basketball team in his high school at first. But the next year, things changed greatly as he grew much taller. Michal Jordan became famous when he joined the university basketball team in North Carolina. Michael used his quickness and strength to reach the basketball. He played so well that people called him ""Air Jordan"". After college, Michael became a basketball team member in the Chicago Bulls. The NBA was very surprised at this high--flying player. He was named ""Rookie ""of the year in 1985 and ""the Most Valuable Player"" in 1987. He once set a record by getting 63 points in one game. ,,."	['Air Jordan']
In the writer's opinion people will get a good result at last if they _ .	Over the last six years I have learned what patience is. Growing up I did not have this virtue and it is a very important virtue to have. Now I can see that if you are patient you will almost always get what you want if you are supposed to have it. I gained patience when I lost my freedom. I knew that I would eventually get it back in time. I was locked up in prison for a period of six years because at 19 years old I was playing with a handgun and I accidentally shot and killed my friend. The first couple of years was the hardest.I was always stressed out about everything.Time was dragging by because I was always paying attention to it.While I was locked up,Tom who I talked to helped put this virtue in me.He told me that it was possible that he would never make it home but that being patient and believing that one day he would was what had made him feel better.After a while I realized why he said a lot of things to me.Once I stopped paying attention to the days and just kept in mind that I would get freedom,it seemed that my time passed quickly. Now I am home and can see that patience paid off for me. I now use this virtue in my daily activities. I know that sometimes life gets hard and that it will pay in the end to stay patient and not to get discouraged. So if you are having a hard time in life,be patient and it will eventually work out one way or another.	"[""keep patient and don't lose heart""]"
The research done by psychologist Rubin centers around _ .

Researching this matter called friendship ,psychologist Lillian Rubin spent two years interviewing more than two hundred women and men .No matter what their age ,their job ,their sex ,the results were completely clear :women have more friendships than men ,and the difference in the content and the quality of those friendships is ""marked and unmistakable ."" More than two -thirds of the single men Rubin interviewed could not name a best friend. Those who could were likely to name a woman .Yet three-quarters of the single women had no problem naming a best friend ,and almost always it was a woman .More married men than women named their wife/husband as a best friend ,most trusted person ,or the one they would turn to in time of emotional distress .""Most women ,""says Rubin ,""identified at least one ,usually more ,trusted friends to whom they could turn in a troubled moment ,and they spoke openly about the importance of these relationships in their lives ."" ""In general,""writes Rubin in her new book ,""women's friendships with each other rest on shared emotions and support ,but men's relationships are marked by shared activities."" For the most part ,Rubin says ,interactions between men are emotionally controlled -a good fit with the social requirements of ""manly behavior ."" ""Even when a man is said to be a best friend ,""Rubin writes ,""the two share little about their innermost feelings .Whereas a woman's closest female friend might be the first to tell her to leave a failing marriage ,it wasn't unusual to hear a man say he didn't know his friend's marriage was in serious trouble until he appeared one night asking if he could sleep on the sofa ."""

If a young man plans to control his own life, it's better for him to _ .	"It is natural that young people are often uncomfortable when they are with their parents. They say that their parents don't understand them. They often think that their parents are out of touch with modern ways: that that they are too serious and too strict with their children; and they seldom give their children a free hand. It is true that parents often find it difficult to win their children's trust and they are easy to forget how they themselves felt when young. For example, young people like to act right away without much thinking. It is one of their ways to show that they have grown up and they can face any difficult situation. Older people worry more easily. Most of them plan things ahead, at least in their minds, and do not like their plans to be upset by something unexpected. When you want your parents to let you do something, you will have better success, if you ask before you really start doing it. Young people often make their parents angry with their choices in clothes, in entertainment and in music. But they do not mean to cause any trouble; it is just that they feel cut off from the older people's world, into which they have not yet been accepted. That's why young people want to make a new culture of their own. And if their parents like their music of entertainment or clothes or their ways of speech, this will make young people especially happy. Sometimes you are so proud of yourself that you do not want your parents to say ""yes"" to what you do. All you want is to be left alone and do what you like. It is natural enough, after being a child for so many years, when you were completely under your parents' control. If you plan to control your life, you'd better win your parents over and try to get them to understand you. If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility, they will certainly give you the right to do what you want to do."	['do everything with a high sense of responsibility']
Which of the following is the first important factor should be considered when adopting a pet?	If your family is thinking of getting a pet, consider adopting from an animal shelter. Animal shelters are full of dogs, cats, rabbits, and more animals, all in need of loving homes. Some may come with emotional or behavioral issues, but most are happy, healthy, and ready for a loving home. Here are some tips for you to find great animals. Make some decision. Think about what you want in a pet and remember that all pets have different personalities. Cats tend to be more independent and need less affection, but kittens need lots of attention. Cats don't need to be walked, but you need to clip their nails and play with them. Dogs need to be walked at the very least twice a day. However, they are usually great companions and love to spend time with their family. Visit the shelter. Set aside at least a few hours to visit shelters in your area--remember that you may need to visit more than one visit. Try to bring along everyone who will be living with a new pet. Ask the shelter staff lots of questions. And never adopt an animal because you feel sorry for it--be patient so you find a pet who is truly a good match for your family. Get everything ready. Buy all necessary supplies and food well before the animal comes home. Make sure that the entire household is in agreement about rules and responsibilities--will the dog be allowed on the couch? Who will clean the litter box? Put it in writing before the pet arrives. Bring your new friend home! You'll probably be excited when your new pet arrives, but be sure to give them space and time to get adjusted to a new home and a new family. The pet may act differently once they leave the shelter. Interact with your pet a lot and get them used to a routine, and soon you'll be one big happy family !	['Think twice about the adoption.']
Beijing will experience sandstorms every March and April mainly because of _ .	Until late April, northern China had experienced eight severe sandstorms this year alone, worsening the air quality in half the region's cities. This year's sandstorms are considered more severe than before. Not only are they increasing in frequency and having more serious effects on air quality, but they are also occurring earlier in the season and affecting a wider area. The timing of the first sandstorm moved up by a week this year, and the sandstorm-affected area has extended beyond 3 million square kilometers. The reason for the frequent dust storms is worsening desertification in China's northern areas, caused by a combination of warm, dry weather and the rapid spread of agriculture. The dust-affected area is likely to expand to the northeast in the near future as a large area of grassland in Inner Mongolia's northern plain turns rapidly to desert. Due to its lack of rainfall and overall surface dryness in the spring, Beijing experiences sandstorms every March and April. The most recent sandstorm hit the capital on April 17 and was the worst in five years. For about 40 days every year, the pollutants cannot be diffused, as the city's location makes it a natural container for accumulating sand and dust. Rapid urban development is affecting Beijing's air quality as well. To _ the dust from hundreds of new construction sites, authorities have issued rules asking builders to cover all working areas, pack down loose dirt, and wash vehicle tires when leaving the sites.

What's the best title of the passage?	"In my mind, there is a moving story about a skinny young boy who loved football with all his heart. Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys,he got ly nowhere. Despite his hard training at all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played. This teenager lived alone with his father, and the relationship between the two of them was very special. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him. The young man loved football and was determined to try his best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a senior. All through high school he never missed a practice nor a game but remained a benchwarmer. Besides, his faithful father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a""walk-on"". Everyone firmly believed that he could never make the cut, but he did. The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games. This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, butactually he never got the real chance to play in a game. It was at the end of his senior football season that the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and he became totally silent. Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach,""My father died this morning. Is it all right if I miss practice today?""The coach put his arm gently around his shoulder and said,""Take the rest of the week off, son. And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday."" Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man quietly slipped into the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines , the coach and his players were surprised to see their faithful teammate back so soon.""Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today,""said the young man. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close play-off game. But the young man insisted, and finally feeling sorry for the kid, the coach gave in.""All right,""he said.""You can go in.""Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran, passed, blocked, and tackled like a star. His team began to succeed. The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds of the game, this kid got a pass and ran all the way for the winning touchdown. Finally, after the stands had emptied, the coach noticed that this young man was sitting quietly in the corner all alone. The coach came to him and said,""Kid, you were unbelievably fantastic! Tell me what got into you? How did you do it?"" He looked at the coach, tears in his eyes, and said,""Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that my dad was blind?""The young man swallowed hard and forced a smile,""Dad came to all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could make it!"""

We can infer from the news that _ .	"The Sauna World Championships ended in tragedy at the weekend when one of the two finalists collapsed and died. Vladimir Ladyzhenskiy, a Russian amateur wrestler in his 60s, suffered severe burns in the bizarre annual event in the southern Finnish town of Heinola. He was pronounced dead late on Saturday after he collapsed alongside reigning champion Timo Kaukonen of Finland roughly six minutes into the final round. The ""sport"" calls on participants to sit in a 230-degree (110 Celsius) room as water was tossed onto a _ stove, officials and witnesses said. Medical workers pulled both men out of the sauna in front of nearly 1,000 horrified spectators. Both were shaking and bleeding from what appeared to be severe burns, said Hakon Eikesdal, a photographer with the Norwegian daily Dagbladet. Kaukonen, about 40, was in hospital in stable condition Sunday, contest spokesman Ossi Arvela said. The event, which had over 130 participants from 15 countries, had been held since 1999. It will never be held again, Arvela said. A pint of water is added to the stove every 30 seconds and the last person to remain at the sauna is the winner. There was no prize other than ""some small things"" Arvela said. He declined to provide details. Arvela said Kaukonen -- the defending world champion -- had refused to leave the sauna despite getting sick. Sauna bathing is a popular past-time in Finland, which has an estimated 1.6 million saunas for a population of 5 million. Temperatures are normally kept around 158 to 176 degrees (70~80 degrees Celsius). ""I know this is very hard to understand to people outside Finland who are not familiar with the sauna habit,"" Arvela said. ""It is not so unusual to have 110 degrees in a sauna. A lot of competitors before have sat in higher temperatures than that."" Arvela said all rules in Saturday's competition were followed and the temperatures and times were similar to those in previous years."

How were the manager and his assistant in behavior?	"Mr. Black was the manager of a hotel in Atlanta. One weekend all of the hotels were full because of a large business meeting being held in the city. On Sunday night, three men came into Mr. Black's hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Black told them that there were no more rooms available. The men didn't know what to do because they had no place to stay in. Mr. Black wanted to help them. He remembered that there was an empty room at the far end of the first floor -- Room 112. It was a very small room, and had rarely been used as a guest room before. So, he asked the three men if they would mind sharing that small room. They replied that they would be very satisfied so long as there was a room for them to stay in for the night. Mr. Black then told them that the room would cost them $ 30 in total. On hearing this, each of the three men gave Mr. Black $ 10 before they left for their room. However, Mr. Black soon began to think that $ 30 was really too much for that small room. He called his assistant over and said, ""Here is $ 5. Give it back to the three men in Room 112. Each of them paid me $10. That's too much."" The assistant took the money. While he was on the way to that small room, he thought, ""How can three men divide $ 5? I'll give each of them only $ 1 and keep the $ 2 left to myself. The men will be happy to get anything back, and I can also make some money that way. After all, Mr. Black will never know anything about it."" So, the assistant returned only $1 to each of the three men. Each man had first paid $ 10. After the assistant returned $1 to him, each man had actually paid only $ 9. There were three men. $ 9x3=""$27."" The assistant kept $ 2. $ 27 + $ 2="" $"" 29. Where is the missing dollar?"

What are adults free to do according to the passage?	Some children cannot wait to grow up. Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places. In Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like. Even though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote. In China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party! No matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups.	['They are free to make their own decisions.']
All the following indicate the importance of a speech goal EXCEPT that _ .	A speech is a wonderful opportunity to inform, persuade or entertain. The best speeches often take on a combination of all three of these components . However, before you can go about the writing of a great speech, it is important to set goals. Goals keep you,your speech and your audience focused. What a goal is In the context of a speech, a goal is the purpose of the speech, and what it hopes to accomplish. For example, the goal of a eulogy might be to celebrate the life of a loved one. The goal of a speech at a political gathering would be to inform the crowd about the political position of a candidate and persuade them to vote and campaign for the candidatein question . Why a goal is important Without a goal, a speech is without direction. The goal informs the structure and content of the speech. For example, if a speech's goal is to convince people that smoking is bad for them, the speech will be structured with persuasive arguments to back up the goal. A speech with a goal of informing the audience will keep the information fair and factual. A goal is incredibly important to the speech's ability to connect with an audience. If the speaker is unaware of the goal of the speech, the audience will likely be unaware as well. This severely reduces the effectiveness of the message. Aside from informing the audience of the content and structure, a speech's goal drives the speaker to greater heights. If a speaker is asked to speak on a specific subject, but never establishes the goal, they won't know where to start in the research, organizing and writing of the speech. _ If you have been charged with delivering a speech, establishing a goal can seem difficult at first. There are several things to take into consideration. First, think about who you will be speaking to. The demographic of your audience will likely determine whether you will be able to persuade them, or whether they will be able to sit through(......). Second, think about the topic itself. If the topic is something controversial , it may worth your while to consider an informative approach to present both sides of the issue. Finally, consider your resources. A speech with an informative or persuasive goal usually requires a great deal of research, and sometimes takes more time to write.

To help David, the writer _ every Wednesday afternoon.	"One day, many years ago, when I was working as a psychologist in England, David was brought into my office. His face was pale and he looked at his own feet. David lost his father when he was two years old and lived with his mother and grandfather ever since. But the year before he turned 13, his grandfather died and his mother was killed in a car accident. His teacher told me that he refused to talk to others from then on. How could I help him? David didn't say a word. As he was leaving, I put my hand on his shoulder.""Come back next week if you like. ""I said. He came and I suggested we play a game of chess. He agreed. After that we played chess every Wednesday afternoon--in complete silence. Usually, he arrived earlier than agreed. It seemed that he liked to be with me. But why didn't he ever look at me? ""Perhaps he simply needs someone to share his pain with,"" I thought. Months later, when I was looking at his head, he suddenly looked up at me. ""It's your turn,"" he said. After that day, David started talking. He finally got friends in school and he even joined a bicycle club. He wrote to me a few times. Now he had re ally started to live his life. Maybe I gave David something. But I learned a lot from him. I learned how time makes it possible to get over what seems to be painful. David showed me how to help people like him.

It can be learnt from the passage that the health benefits of exercise _ .	America is a country on the move. In unheard of numbers, people of all ages are exercising their way to better health. According to the latest figures, 59 percent of American adults exercise regularly-up 12 percent from just two years ago and more than double the figure of 25 years ago. Even non-exercisers believe they would be more attractive and confident if they were more active. It is hard not to get the message. The virtues of physical fitness are shown on magazine covers, postage stamps, and television ads of everything from beauty soaps to travel books. Exercise as a part of daily life did not catch on until the late 1960s when research by military doctors began to show the health benefits of doing regular physical exercises. Growing publicity for races held in American cities helped fuel a strong interest in the ancient sport of running. Although running has _ in recent years as Americans have discovered equally rewarding--and sometimes safer-forms of exercise, such as walking and swimming, running remains the most popular form of exercise. As the popularity of exercise continues to mount, so does scientific evidence of its health benefits. The key to fitness is exercising the major muscle groups vigorously enough to approximately double the heart rate and keep it doubled for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Doing such physical exercises three times or more a week will produce considerable improvements in physical health in about three months.	['are self evident']
What the Queen really meant was that _ .	"A man in a very splendid restaurant started to take off his jacket. Seeing this, the head waiter ran to his table and said, ""I'm afraid I must ask you to keep your jacket on, sir, for it is not good manners to do it in such a smart restaurant."" ""Now listen"", said the man, ""I'll let you know that the Queen of England gave me permission to remove my jacket here."" ""The Queen of England?"" said the waiter in great surprise. ""Sure,"" replied the man, ""When I was in England last month, a friend of mine who had a very important position took me to see the Queen. It was rather hot, so I started taking my coat off. The Queen looked over and said, 'You may do that in the United States, but you may not do it here.' So I got the Queen's permission, right?"""

How did Wu Tong go to Taian?	"Dear Nancy, How are you? Now I want to tell something interesting. Last week we had a trip to Mount Tai. On Tuesday we went to Taian by bus, a city at the foot of the mountain. We had a good rest at a hotel. At about one o'clock early the next morning, we began to climb the mountain. It took us about four hours and a half to get to the top. The mountain is covered with trees. I didn't see such a beautiful place before. ""Look! The sun is going to rise!"" my friend Lim shouted. We all turned to the east and watched. Soon half of the sky because white, and a big, red ball was rising slowly. A few minutes later, the sky became bright . We stayed on the top and had a good time. After lunch we started going down. We got to the tour hotel at about four in the afternoon. Though we were tired, we were very happy. We came back to school the next day. Thank you very much for your last letter and the beautiful postcards. Hope to hear from you soon. Yours Wu Tong"	['By bus.']
What's the main idea of the passage _ ?	"Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability. People with autism have trouble communicating and with social skills. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the person also might repeat some behaviors and not want change in their daily activities. Some people with the condition need a lot of help. Others need less. CDC officials say autism affects one in every 68 children in the United States. More boys than girls are believed to have the condition. But the number of cases appears to be growing. It is unclear whether the growing number shows a real increase or comes from more knowledge about this disorder. Symptoms of autism Common signs of autism include trouble making eye contact and a delay in learning how to speak. Some people with severe autism never learn how to talk. Many people with autism also have difficulty understanding facial expressions and the feelings of others. They also have trouble making friends of the same age. Doctors have learned how to recognize autism, but much is still unknown about its causes. Researchers at Harvard University have come closer to finding answers. They found that women exposed to the highest levels of fine particulate air pollution late in their pregnancies are two times more likely to give birth to a child with autism. The findings appeared in Environmental Health Perspectives -- a publication of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The study found that the women who were around high levels of fine particulate matter air pollution were at highest risk of having an autistic child. The increased risk of these women was two times that of women who lived in areas with low levels of fine particulate pollution. The researchers found that the timing of exposure to pollution was important. They found no increased risk of autism in children whose mothers were around high levels of pollution before becoming pregnant. And the study found air pollution does not seem to increase the risk of children developing autism after they are born. What can pregnant women do? Mr. Weisskopf says pregnant women should avoid air pollution as much as possible. But he warns that other things may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. ""You can avoid being in extremely polluted cities during pregnancy if possible. You can also choose to go running in a park rather than next to a street. But that said, I think also it's very important to recognize that autism spectrum disorders is a very multi-factorial disorder. And there are lots of reasons why risk could be increased."" Autism is believed to result from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. For now, Marc Weisskopf says researchers are trying to identify the exact substances in air pollution that increase the risk of autism."	['autism and air pollution']
The Dominican Republic is famous for	South of Florida, many islands dot the ocean. One of them is Hispaniola. Its name points to the fact that Christopher Columbus visited the island in 1492. As a result, Spain ruled theisland for th e next 300 years. Two nations now share the island. Haiti makes up the western third. The Dominican Republic makes up the eastern two-thirds. The Dominican Republic's area is about 18,000 square miles with the population of 8 million. Most people live close to the island's coast. Like many other tropical islands, the Dominican Republic regards tourism as a key industry. The coastal citie s, especially, depend on tourists to fill their hotels and restaurants. The natural beauty of the beaches and of the forests draw Dominicans and tourists alike. When you're ready for something else,walk into town.Music,dancing,and people in Colourful masks will greet you at nearly every street corner. Whether you go to join them or get away from them, there will be a place for you in the Dominican Republic.	['tourism']
Why does France appear less foreign than Germany to Americans on their first visit to Europe?	"If you ask people to name the one person who had the greatest effect on the English language, you will get answers like ""Shakespeare,"" ""Samuel Johnson,"" and ""Webster,"" but none of these men had any effect at all compared to a man who didn't even speak English--William the Conqueror . Before 1066, in the land we now call Great Britain lived people belonging to two major language groups. In the west-central region lived the Welsh, who spoke a Celtic language, and in the north lived the Scots, whose language, though not the same as Welsh, was also Celtic. In the rest of the country lived the Saxons, actually a mixture of Anglos, Saxons, and other Germanic and Nordic peoples, who spoke what we now call Anglo-Saxon (or Old English), a Germanic language. If this state of affairs had lasted, English today would be close to German. But this state of affairs did not last. In l066 the Normans led by William defeated the Saxons and began their rule over England. For about a century, French became the official language of England while Old English became the language of peasants. As a result, English words of politics and the law come from French rather than German. In some cases, modern English even shows a distinction between upper-class French and lower-class Anglo-Saxon in its words. We even have different words for some foods, meat in particular, depending on whether it is still out in the fields or at home ready to be cooked, which shows the fact that the Saxon peasants were doing the farming, while the upper-class Normans were doing most of the eating. When Americans visit Europe for the first time, they usually find Germany more ""foreign"" than France because the German they see on signs and advertisements seems much more different from English than French does. Few realize that the English language is actually Germanic in its beginning and that the French influences are all the result of one man's ambition ."

What did Jack do after hearing his friend's joke?	"A Deaf Person's Joke Something was wrong with Jack's ears after he was much better from a serious illness. Several months later he went to a doctor. The doctor told him that he was deaf of both ears. Jack was sad. He was afraid to lose his work. So he did not like people to know this. One evening he asked some friends to dinner. While they were sitting at the table, one of his friends told an interesting joke. Everyone laughed and Jack laughed louder than anyone else. He said, ""That was a very interesting joke, but I know a more interesting one. Would you like to hear it?"" All his friends said OK to him, so Jack began to tell his joke. All his friends were listening to him with smiles. When the joke ended, everyone laughed louder than before and Jack laughed happily, too. He was very glad because he thought that his must be more interesting than his friend's. But he didn't know that he had made a fool of himself(;) because his joke was the same as the first one."

The text mainly tells us _ .	"Roman Pantheon is one of the greatest achievements of the ancient Romans. The ancient Romans were good architects and they built many wonderful buildings. Another good example of a Roman architectural style is the Roman Coliseum, which is a large building used for public sports events or entertainment. The Roman architectural style has been borrowed by many of the western countries. The architecture of Pantheon is unique to Rome. In Latin and Greek, pantheon means ""Temple of all the Gods"". Marcus Agrippa built the original Pantheon in 27 BC. But the Pantheon built by Agrippa was completely destroyed in 80 AD when a fire broke out. The Roman Pantheon that is visited by many tourists today was rebuilt in 125 AD by the Roman emperor Hadrian. Hadrian's architects followed the exact design of Marcus Agrippa. Historians believe that the Pantheon was a place of worship because it housed all the gods and goddesses of the ancient Romans. The Pantheon of Rome is an amazing example of ancient Roman architecture. This building has been in use for over 2000 years. The Roman Pantheon is famous for its design, size. The most unbelievable feature of this building is its huge concrete dome . The Pantheon's dome was thought to be the largest, until recent times. Phocas, the Byzantine Emperor presented the Roman Pantheon to Pope Boniface IV to save it from the destruction. In 609 AD, it was turned into a church. During Papal rule, it was used as a burial ground for kings and other famous people. There are tombs of Raphael (a painter), King Victor Emmanuel II, King Umberto I and many more in the Pantheon. Some of the buildings that were constructed on the model of the Roman Pantheon are The Rotunda - University of Virginia, Low Memorial Library - Columbia University, Grand Auditorium - Tsinghua University, Jefferson Memorial - Washington D.C. and Duomo - Florence."

What did a few lucky fishermen find when they return? _	The Sir Lankan coastline is filled with fishermen who use the sea as their main source of living. Their daily catch would define the life of their own and their families. But it only took a few hours to remove their life-long habitat right in front of their eyes. Some fishermen had set sail on Christmas night. A very few were lucky enough to return the next morning. But none found any of what they left behind the other night. They were made to lose their families by the very waters that they used to love the most. The few who made it through the day have been wondering about the meaning of their lives. They had used the sea for decades, but the sea used them for a single day. Is it justice ? Or killing? What would become of them? For whom would they go fishing again? As they struggle with their conflicting feelings, they also come to remind themselves of their struggle for survival. Where are they now? They didn't leave the beach, or the sea. They will be back because the sea is their home and the only means of living, so they will continue in their fight for destiny . But will it be the same? Sadly not. Even though they force themselves to forgive, they can't forget. They will never be able to get through the idea of _ turning against them. That fear would always run deep in their hearts. As the fishermen get ready to take on their duties once again, each would take with them a frightful story that reminds them of the day of betrayal , the day that rewrote their lives.

What is the main idea of the passage?	"BEIJING--Just as the Chinese people joyfully await the traditional Spring Festival, President Hu Jintao returned here Saturday after successfully concluding a four-day state visit to the United States,which opens a new chapter in cooperative partnership between China and the United States. During his visit,President Hu spared no efforts to make friends,to proclaim China' s philosophy of peaceful development and to express the Chinese people' s willingness to join hands with the world to greet a spring of harmonious development. In Washington,President Hu and his US counterpart,Barack Obama,agreed to build a China-US cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit,and marke d out priorities of the development of China-US relations for the future. Hu met with people from all walks of life in the United States,expounding to them the various policies of the Chinese government and China' s stand on developing China-US ties in the new era.

Which one is true?	Many overseas Chinese make their kids learn the Chinese language because they don't want them to lose their mother language. In the city of Portland in the USA, there is a weekend Chinese school in a church. In the school, there are Chinese kids and American kids. They study Chinese on Saturdays and Sundays. Teachers at the school are usually some overseas Chinese women. Miss Tian is one of them. She is from Beijing. She teaches her students many Chinese characters, sentences and Chinese songs. Most of these kids speak English better than Chinese, because they spend most of their time at the local school, and their classmates are American.Their teachers teach them in English. When the overseas Chinese children get home after school, their parents often speak Chinese to them. Only at that time do they think they are at home.	['Most kids speak English better than Chinese.']
Which of the following is NOT mentioned as the similarity between Mo Yan and Shen Congwen?	"When talking with young Swedish students, Mo Yan showed respect for Chinese authors that he learned writing from, particularly Shen Congwen, who was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize. ""Lu Xun, Lao She, Mao Dun and Shen Congwen, they are more qualified for the Nobel Prize than me,"" he said,. Among the writers he learned from, he said he especially felt close to Shen Congwen, as they have similar life experiences. Both of them left school early and did not get formal education. Shen quit after high school and Mo only finished the fifth grade. They both joined the army after school. "" We both learned from the book of life,"" said Mo. The themes of their writing are also similar. Both writers have their hometown as the theme and root of their writings. Shen'works are mostly about his hometown, Xiangxi, and most of Mo's stories are set in his hometown, Gaomi, in Shandong Province. Mo said he also learned from Shen how to deal with characters in a fiction. Unlike most Chinese writers, Shen has a humanistic touch towards all of his characters. Said Mo, ""In his works, there are no particularly bad person or good person. Even gangsters and thieves have their humane side,"" he said. ""I try to use the same approach in my writing. It shows the ability of a novelist when he treats all the characters as humans,"" he said. Mo said he also learned Lu Xun's depth and Lao She's humor. ""They are all my teachers, and I am the student,"" he said. ""I feel ashamed from my heart that teachers did not get the prize, but the student got it."""	['Sense of humor']
The best title of the passage is _ .	How often do you go on holiday? Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home. The Holiday Health Experiment was conducted by tour operator Kuoni and Nuffield Health, the UK's largest healthcare charity.	['Health Benefits from Holiday']
The main idea of this passage is _ .	What is your favorite color? Do you like yellow, orange, and red? If you do, you must be an optimist , a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grays and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference , and the effect that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress rings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark gray. Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a new shirt or a few colorful things. Remember also that you will know your friends and your enemies better when you find out what colors they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about your character when you choose a piece of handkerchief.	"[""one's color preference has something to do with his character and colors have effects on human beings""]"
What can you see if you walk on the Henderson Island today?	Henderson Island is a coral island raised above the South Pacific Ocean, No people live on it. The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life. All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life. On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?	"""Children should not be left unsupervised to play with a dog."" say experts in this week's British Medical Journal. Their advice is part of a review aimed at doctors who deal with dog bites. ""Dog bites and maulings are a worldwide problem, particularly in children."" write Marina Morgan and John Palmer. Every year 250,000 people who have been bitten by dogs attend minor injuries and emergency units in the United Kingdom, and half of all children are reportedly bitten by dogs at some time, boys more than girls. Accurate death figures are difficult to obtain, but in the past five years, two to three cases a year have made news headlines. Based on the latest medical evidence, _ advise doctors how to examine and treat a patient presenting with a dog bite. They discuss the risk of infection and when to refer to specialist care. For travelers bitten abroad, they suggest assessing the risk of rabies . In terms of prevention, they suggest that children should be taught to treat dogs with respect, avoid direct eye contact, and not tease them. They should be taught not to approach an unfamiliar dog; play with any dog unless under close supervision; run or scream in the presence of a dog; pet a dog without first letting it sniff you; or disturb a dog that is eating, sleeping, or caring for its babies. ""Dog owners also need to change their behavior"", says Rachel Besser, a children's doctor and lifetime dog owner, in an article. ""It is clear that not all dog owners appreciate that children should not be left unsupervised with a dog"", she says. Just as some parents are obliged to take parenting classes, she would like to see compulsive classes for expectant dog owners to teach them about the responsibilities of dog ownership. Educational programs are also needed to teach children about some precautionary behaviors around dogs. Finally, she would like to see animal doctors advising dog owners about bite prevention, and doctors promoting bite prevention when treating patients who have been bitten by dogs."

Why did the government start the website?	"The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an ""education"" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. ""Call me Haiz"", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value. First Lady Michelle Obama has said she would like to see advertisers marketing healthy foods for children."	['To attract the biggest market of buyers.']
According to the passage, Project Gutenberg is probably _ .	Every year many students went to the college bookstore to purchase the different textbooks that they need for their classes. Little do these students realize that, in doing so, they are throwing good money away. It may sound unbelievable but textbooks, in some cases, actually cost as much as, if not more than, college fees. Many people think that college bookstores are the most convenient source for textbooks. Titles are usually kept and students may purchase new textbooks or choose to buy second-hand books and save money. But the money saved by purchasing second-hand textbooks from college bookstores is small compared to the amount they could save by shopping online. More and more online booksellers have begun selling textbooks at heavily discounted prices. Online second-hand bookstores are another source for college books as they keep a large number of textbooks, which means sizable savings for students. Students should avoid purchasing their textbooks at the first store that they surf online since there are so many 'unreal' booksellers on the Net. Price isn't the only factor to consider when making an online purchase. Students should also consider shopping costs and delivery time when making their decision. Online auctions are another option for students seeking a bargain. This option, however, has its _ . A plus is that students can get incredibly cheap books. One problem is that while online bookstores have a system in place that ensure you receive your order within a reasonable amount of time, with an auction purchase, however, you must depend on the auction seller's timetable. One way that students can really save is by getting books for free. Project Gutenberg is one resource that English majors will find invaluable. Here students can legally download a huge collection of classic novels. In the past students needing help with their studies would often have to spend a lot of money buying expensive study guides. Today that is no longer the case. Cash-strapped students can now visit the website SparkNotes for free downloadable study guides as well as classics.

An old man and his wife used to live on the second floor. Bill's mother and the old lady were good friends. Unfortunately the lady died last month. Her husband could not live alone, so he had his grandson move over and live with him. The grandson has become a problem to all the neighbors, especially to Bill's family. The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. Bill is used to peace and quiet but the young man likes to listen to the radio late at night. Sometimes friends of his visit and they make a lot of noise. That is too much for Bill's family. Bill's mother once asked the old man politely if he was able to sleep well at night, but obviously the man didn't understand what she meant.

The author was deeply moved by her daughter's _ .	"I still remember the last time I went to the playground with two of my children. It had rained during the night and the playground was very muddy . They had just put on clean clothes, so I was a little worried about the mud on the playground. It was not long before Kathy got her beautiful skirt dirty on the playground. She dug through the rocks. I was about to blame her for getting her clothes dirty when she ran towards me with a smile on her face. When she got to me, she handed me a little heart-shaped rock and said, ""Here, Mom! Here is a heart for you --just because I love you! Keep it!"" With tears in my eyes, I thanked her. Should I blame her for getting her clothes muddy? No way! I still have that little heart-shaped rock. It is one of the best gifts that I have ever received. I realized that many times it was not necessary for us adults to worry about the small things our children did. Let them do what they'd like to. I will spend a lot more time on the playground with my children. I'm sure I will learn a lot from them. It makes me think of the days when my grandfather told me, ""You would not enter the kingdom of happiness until you pretended to be a small child."""	['special way to show her love']
The best title for this passage is _ .	Is war unavoidable? Can war be prevented? History tells that there were wars, great or small, in every century, in every decade. Throughout the ages, from the Stone age to the Atomic Age, men have been fighting, first with swords and shields , then with guns and cannons, and now, hydrogen bombs and missiles are used for military purpose. But, in spite of all these, it is still my belief that war can be prevented and peace can be won, but it requires the effort of every one of us. I am sure that we would not like to experience another world war. If it ever happens, two-thirds of the world and much of the civilization which men have gained through time, patience and effort will be destroyed. Will then the remaining one-third of the world be able to survive on its own? Our task now is not to blame the past, but to plan for the future. If there is peace in the world, men can use their rockets to explore the mystery of space, their submarines to explore the depth of the sea, their missiles to deliver mails and their fine equipment to penetrate the jungles of Africa, instead of using them military. Governments can use their money to build more schools, so that more children can be educated to be useful citizens. Scientists can use atomic energy to propel steamships and planes. They can also design new machines to increase the production of goods and thus improve the way of living of the people. How can a peaceful world be achieved? It requires, in my opinion, the understanding and friendship between all people from all nations. Let no one suffer discrimination by reason of color, race, religion, or national origin. Let the rich support the poor and the strong help the weak. We know that neither peace nor such a dream world can come true in a day or a month. It may even take decades or centuries. But let us plan and begin now.	['War and Peace']
When volunteers know most of the aged people are dying patients, they feel _ .	"Youth volunteers from Beijing University visited Song tang Hospital, a care clinic for the aged and dying patients, during the second Global Youth Service Day on April 21. Thirty student volunteers from the university's School of International Studies sat at the beds of the patients in their specially - decorated"" care huts"". They talked with them and gave massages to patients kept in their beds. I felt sorry that I could not offer more to these people than talking with them and trying to cheer them up. said Deng Yetao, 20, a third - year student. ""But it occurred to me that they need more care and love than babies. They are afraid of the coming death. Their loneliness is worse than physical pains."" ""Even though they are suffering a lot, the majority of the elderly people want to talk to us. Each of them has a lot of life experiences and philosophies to share. _ Said Mao Xiaohua, another third - year student. Mao talked with two elderly patients for a whole afternoon. The fact that most of the patients in the 80 - room clinic are aged people with diseases which will lead to death soon made the volunteers' hearts heavy. Ninety - one percent of the patients will spend the last days of their lives in the clinic, according to a survey by the hospital. Daily visits and services by social workers and youth volunteers are a very important part of their programmer. A total of 330, 000 Beijing students from 119 universities and colleges have visited the hospital. Many continue to offer services in their spare time. Some of them volunteer to hold the hands of dying patients during the last minutes of their lives. Yin Hang, a student from Beijing Medical College, said he felt"" the glory of life"" as he saw the fading smile on the face of the old man who passed into a deep unconsciousness while he was holding his hands."

The best title of the passage might be _ .	"To switch or not to switch, that is the question.Google's announcement of its Nexus One smartphone happened over a week ago and I'm still receiving lots of e-mails from readers asking the same question: Should they give up their iPhone for the Nexus One? Some people with iPhones, disappointed by American Telephone&Telegraph's inadequate service and the high monthly cost, are wondering if they have really got something to replace it.Does the Nexus One offer the functions that Apple has led them to expect? I'm on the fence myself, even though I never thought I'd be interested in anything but the iPhone.From my experience using the Nexus One, and from talking to people who have made the change, it's not necessarily about the differences between the iPhone and the Nexus One.The phones are extremely similar in design and general feel.Instead, the decision can be made based on the software services you use on your desktop. My friend Chad Dickerson received a pre-launch Nexus One from Google three weeks ago.He said Google's phone feels connected to certain services on the Web in a way the iPhone doesn't.""Compared to the iPhone, the Google phone feels like it's part of the Internet to me,"" he said.""If you live in a Google world, you have that world in your pocket in a way that's cleaner and more connected than the iPhone.""

Why are there fewer children with myopia in Sydney than in Singapore ?	"For better eyesight, doctors advise limiting the hours of screen time and encourage having enough eye resting time. However, another study shows that sitting in front of computer or TV screens for long hours is not the only reason formyopia . An Australian research team studied young children in Sydney and Singapore to find the reasons for myopia. The research team found that theprevalence of myopia among children in Sydney was lower than children in Singapore, even though they spent more time in front of computer and TV screens. The major finding is that children in Sydney spend longer hours on outdoor activities than those in Singapore. Indoor and outdoor sports activities both make the eyes focus on more distant objects, which prevents the eyes from changing shape. But outdoor activities may better help avoid myopia than indoor sports activities. Jane Gwiazda, who does research in sight problems, says: ""Natural light is good for eye growth. And extra vitamin D from the sun might contribute to eye growth."" Many doctors suggest that every child get its first eye test done when he/she is about two and half years old, and even if his/her sight seems perfect. It is necessary for myopic children to wear glasses to prevent headaches, trouble reading or injuries. It is also important that schools invite doctors to test their students' eyes. If that is not possible, school teachers should at least encourage parents and children to have regular eye examinations and wear glasses. And parents should remember not only to limit the total screen time for their children, but also to encourage them to spend time outdoors."	['Because Sydney children do more outdoor sports.']

One of the cows broke into the door of the store-house with her horns and all the animalsbegan to help themselves to the grains.It was just then that Mr.Jones woke up.The nextmoment he and his four men were in the store-house with whips in their hands,whipping in all directions.This was more than the hungry animals would bear.Together,though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they jumped upon their masters. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being struck with horns and kicked from allsides.The situation was quite out of their control.They had never seen animals act like thisbefore, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to beating andwhipping just as they chose frightened them.After only a moment or two, they gave up tryingto defend themselves.A minute later all five of them were in full fright down the road, with theanimals running after them joyfully."

What can we learn from the passage?	"It was the beginning of the school year a few years ago and I had a little boy in my class who came from a non - English speaking home, He was very quiet and shy, I wasn't sure how much he understood during the school day and I was especially concerned that he just stood by himself at break time and did not play, If I tried to talk to him , he would turn away and tightly shut his eyes to hide from me. After a day or two of this, I decided to seek the help from one of my outgoing and friendly little girls, I called her over and she ran to me , ready to help. I immediately began a long speech about what I needed from her, I asked her if she would try to get him to play, and I started talking quickly about all these suggestions on how she could start communication with him , I explained she could do that , she could try this idea, she could try that idea, ""Don't worry, I speak kid"" And she ran off. I stood there all alone, silently watching her, It took less than a minute for the two new friends to urn off, hand in hand , happily joining a game of tag taking place all over the gym. I often think of that small moment, about what I learned and how important it is for all teachers to speak kid --- big kid, little kid and middle kid , I know my focus must be on teaching students how to think , how to approach problems ,and how to figure out solutions and teaching them never to let _ away , We must be ready to learn from our students because those ""teachable moments ""during the school days are for us , the teachers, as well as our kids."

The old woman was happiest when _ .	"There once was a little boy who wanted to meet God. He knew it was a long trip to where God lived, so he packed his suitcase with bread and a six-pack of beer and started on his journey. When he had gone about three blocks, he met an old woman. She was sitting in the park just staring at some pigeons. The boy sat down next to her and opened his suitcase. He was about to take a drink from his root beer when he noticed that the old lady looked hungry ,so he offered her a chunk of bread. She gratefully accepted it and smiled at him. Her smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again, so he offered her some beer. Once again she smiled at him. The boy was delighted! They sat there all afternoon eating and smiling, but they never said a word. As it began to grow dark, the boy realized how sad he was and he got up to leave. He turned around, ran back to the old woman and gave her a hug . She gave him her biggest smile ever. When the boy opened the door to his own house a short time later, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on his face. She asked him, ""What did you do today that made you so happy?"" He replied, ""I had lunch with God. You know what? She's got the most beautiful smile I've ever seen!"" Meanwhile, the old woman, also radiant with joy, returned to her home.

The reason accounting for the hesitation to accept the idea of the Enviropig is _ .	"Farm-raised pigs are dirty, smelly animals that get no respect. They're also an environmental hazard. Their manure contains phosphorus ,which, when it rains, runs off into lakes and rivers, consuming oxygen, killing fish, stimulating algae overgrowth and emitting greenhouse gases. Doing away with the pig is not an option. Pigs provide more dietary protein, more cheaply, to more people than any other animal. Northern Europe still maintains the highest pig-to-human ratio in the world (2-1 in Denmark), but East Asia is catching up. During the 1990s, pork production doubled in Vietnam and grew by 70 percent in China--along densely populated coastlines, pig density exceeds 100 animals per square kilometer. The resulting pollution is ""threatening fragile coastal marine habitats including mangroves ,coral reefs and sea grasses ,""according to a report released in February by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. As it turns out, there is a solution to the pig problem, but it requires a change of mind-set among environmentalists and the public. Two Canadian scientists have created a pig whose manure doesn't contain very much phosphorus at all. If this variety of pig were adopted widely, It could greatly reduce a major source of pollution. But the Enviropig, as they call it, is the product of genetic modification--which is anathema to many Westerners. The Enviropig is one of many new technologies that are putting environmentalists and organic-food supporters in _ : should they remain categorically opposed to genetically modified (GM)foods even at the expense of the environment? Elsewhere, trees grown for paper could be made amenable to much more efficient processing, reducing both energy usage and toxic chemical bleach in waste water from paper mills. The most significant GM applications will be ones that help lessen the problem of agriculture , which accounts for 38percent of the world's landmass and is crowding out natural ecosystems and species habitats. Chances are, farmers will continue to grow their polluting organic pork, their allergenic organic soy and their neurotoxin sprayed organic apples. Worse still, they will make sure that no one else gets a choice in the matter of improving the conditions of life on earth--unless, that is, others rise up and demand an alternative."

What do the findings of the new research imply?	"Some pigs lend lo be optimistic while others have a more pessimisitic view , according to a new research that is meaningful to animal welfare. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, is the first to show that mood and personality interact in an animal, influencing judgment. Asher, a researcher at ihc University of Newcastle's Institute of Neurowcience, and her team housed groups of pigs in the two types of environments. One reflected sandard commercial conditions and the other was _ with more space and plenty of sell, deep straw. After the pigs got accusitomed to these new homes over a few weeks , the rescarchers picked 18 pigs from each type of housing arrangement to train and test their judgment. "" To do this, we trained each pig that in one comer of a training room there would be a bowl wilh chocolate sweets -- specifically M&Ms, pigs love M&Ms -- and in a bowl at the opposite side of the room there would be a bowl that would contain coffee beans, which pigs find bitter-tasting,"" senior author Lisa Collins of the Univerersty of Lincoln's School of Life Sciences said. Over n number of training trials , pigs leamed to go to the bowl reliably when it was in the corner where they had figured out to expect M&Ms.On the contrary,they quickly leamed to avoid the bowl when it was't in the comer where they would expect to find the coffee beans. The rescearchers next placed an unfamimliar bowl in different locations , to see how the pigs would react. Some gaily dashed to the bowl no matter what, exhibiting optimism that it would contain there favorite sweds. Others, however, behaved as though they expected it to contain coffee beans, displaying pessimism. The findings suggest that a one -- size- fits - all answer to animal welfare issues does not exist. Even if pigs are just equal lo bacon or other meal for some people, there is still cause for conccrn . Student have suggested that how an animal is trented during is lifetime can directly affect meal quality and taste."	"[""People should meet pigs' various needs.""]"
As for its first task, Washoe was involved with _ .	"Washoe, a female chimpanzee believed to be the first non-human to acquire human language, has died of natural causes at the research institute where she was kept.The chimp died on Tuesday night, according to Roger and Deborah Fouts, co-founders of The Chimpanzee and Human Communications Institute in Washington, where she lived. Washoe was born in 1965 in Africa, where she was captured by the Air Force and taken to the US for research use in the space program. In 1966, she left the program and began living with two scientists, Allen and Beatrix Gardner, who led a project to teach the chimp American Sign Language (ASL) in Washoe, Nevada, for which it was named. Washoe had been living on Central Washington University's Ellensburg Campus since 1980. She had a vocabulary of about 250 words. Also, Washoe taught sign language to three younger chimps: Tatu, 31, Loulis, 29, and Dar, 31 Primate researcher Jane Goodall, in Fouts' book Next of Kin, noted the importance of the work with Washoe. ""Roger, through his ongoing conversations with Washoe and her extended family, has opened a window into a chimpanzee's mind,"" Goodall said. Though previous efforts to teach chimps spoken languages had failed, the researchers believed there was a better chance using signs. But Washoe's language skills were disputed by scientists who believed that language is unique to humans. Among those who doubted that chimps could use language were linguist Noam Chomsky and Harvard scientist Steven Pinker. They believed primates simply learn to perform certain acts in order to receive rewards, and do not acquire true language."	['some space research']
Parents would not like their children to see commercials because _	Children in the United States are exposed to many influences other than that of their families.Television is the most significant of these influences,because the habit of watching television usually begins before children start attending school. Parents are concerned about the lack of quality in television programs for children.The degree of violence in many of these shows also worries them.Studies indicate that,when children are exposed to violence,they many become aggressive or insecure. Parents are also concerned at,out the commercials that their children see on television. Many parents would like to see fewer commercials during programs for children.And some parents feel that these shows should not have any commercials at all because young minds are not mature enough to deal with the claims made by advertisers. Educational television has no commercials and has programs for children that many parents approve of The most famous of these is Sesame Street,which tries to give preschool children a head start in learning the alphabet and numbers.It also flies to teach children useful things about the world in which they live. Even though most parents and educators give Sesame Street and shows like it high marks for quality,some critics argue that all television,whether educational or not,is harmful to children.These critics feel that the habit of watching hours of television every day turns children into bored and passive consumers of their world rather than encouraging them to become active explorers of it.

Through the passage the writer wants to tell people not to _ .	As we know, most of the material things in our daily life have to be bought with money. But money is not all powerful. Money can't buy many things such as time and true love. There are 24 hours in a day. Sometimes when we are very happy, we wish that the period of happiness would last longer. But no matter what we do, or how much money we are willing to pay, we cannot make a day last longer than 24 hours. On the other hand, when we are unhappy, money cannot make the unhappy time pass away more quickly. True love is another thing which money cannot buy. Suppose we have someone who really loves us very much. Once he dies, he can give us no more love. Can our money raise him from death and make him love us as before? Here we can see very clearly that money cannot buy us love. Money can buy us diamond things, beautiful clothes, but never time and love. So money, after all, is not all powerful.	['worship  money']

Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the passage?	"Sally Donovan is cooking when a paper plane flies across the kitchen and lands at her feet. She picks it up, unfolds it and finds a child's sketch of a tear-stained face with a speech bubble saying: ""I'm sorry I was naughty--I'm a bad person."" Sally, 42, draws a big smiley face on the back of the paper with ""I love you, Rose, and we're always going to look after you."" Then she folds it up and launches the plane back into the living room where her nine-year-old daughter is watching TV with brother Jamie, 13 and dad Rod, 40. Jamie often makes pictures for his parents too--like the one showing a swift river with them on one side and him trapped on the other side. It's one of the many unusual ways that Sally and Rob have learned to communicate emotionally with their abused children in an astonishing eight-year journey of hope, healing and love. Jamie was just four and half--sister Rose one when they were adopted by the Donovans in 2005. The youngsters had been taken from their natural mother and placed in foster care after a series of cruelty and neglect. They were left alone, hungry, and witnessed home violence on a regular basis. Sally and Rob spent three years trying for a baby before deciding to adopt, and were well aware of the youngsters' poor background. But they were still unprepared for raising a child permanently scared by abuse or the lack of support on offer. But now Sally has written a brilliant and heart-touching account of their family struggle in a book called ""No Matter What"". Sally said: ""These kids come to you with a story that what happened to them was their fault--because they are bad and unlovable. To show them they are loveable and none of it was their fault takes a lot of time. They both still say ""I'm bad"". Jamie is less stuck on it now but whenever life deals him a knock, he will fall back into 'that happened because I am stupid, I'm rubbish, I'm bad'."" Sally's book is humorous, heart-touching and so wildly honest that academics, charity bosses, parents and adoptees are praising it as a major contribution to child welfare work."

According to this passage, which of the following is NOT true?	"United States President George W. Bush is expected to issue a directive in the next few weeks. It will give the US Air Force a green light for the development of space weapons, US media reported last week. This would potentially start a new global arms race, some experts have warned. To keep that from happening, last Wednesday the White House explained that it was not considering putting weapons in space. It said it was making a shift inprefix = st1 /USspace policy to allow for protection of satellites. But some defense analysts and arms control advocates argue that the policy will pave the way for the US to put both defensive and offensive ( ) weapons in space. ""No one should be fooled,"" said Theresa Hitchens, an American weapons expert. The USis now restricted by a 1996 directive signed by President Bill Clinton. Plans for space weapons were vetoed by the Clinton cabinet. The directive emphasized the peaceful use of space , in agreement with almost unanimous ( ) global opinion. The USmilitary has placed importance on space and has sent up numberous satellites for troop communications and to provide intelligence and data to guide bombs to their targets. The US Air Force wants to develop space- based weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world within 90 minutes of receiving the order to open fire. These new weapons under development cover a wide range. They include hunter- killer satellites and orbiting weapons. And they use lasers, radio waves, or even dense metal tubes, known as "" Rods from God"", dropped from space to do the damage. There are many barriers to the setting up of this kind of program, experts say. First is the coast. It is estimated that the budget may be US $220 billion to US $ 1 trillion . The technical difficulties of developing reliable space weapons are also a problem. And, the program will draw strong criticism from around the world. Experts worry about starting a space arms race."

What would be the best title for the text?	They say love can cover a lot of crimes; yet never have I seen it more beautifully showed than in the life of a dog named Jessie. Jessie came into our lives at the age of six months. By that time he had already experienced the hard knocks of life. He was found abandoned on the side of the road, where we adopted him and took him home. From the beginning, it was obvious that Jessie was traumatized . He was afraid of everything: the car, the doors, the stairs, and just about everything else. We couldn't foresee where Jessie's fear would take us. Jessie was with us for about six months, when we became foster parents to a mixed-breed young dog. Jessie did not like her at all. We all lived in a nervous co-existence, until dinnertime. Within moments a food fight erupted between Jessie and this foster child. It all happened so fast, and I was in the middle. My husband managed to get in between the two dogs, grabbing Jessie by his collar. Jessie screamed all the way down the hall and into the bedroom. I, quickly put the foster dog into her own bedroom and hurried down the hall. The crashing I heard in the bedroom, scared me to death. But nothing prepared me for the scene I witnessed as I opened the bedroom door. There was my husband, on top of a terrified Jessie, holding back his head. Blood dripped from my husband's arm. To tell you the truth, as I was sitting beside my husband in the emergency room, I just didn't know what to do with Jessie. I was so angry at that dog. Day after day, week after week, however, my husband faithfully trained the dog that others would have put down. As his arm healed over the next months, something rare and beautiful began to take place. Jessie, under my husband's gentle persuasion, began to understand and obey. And Jessie adored him. I could see, that although the tempest had ruled Jessie's former life, affirmation and love had calmed the storm.	['Love Calmed the Storm']
What would be the best title for this passage?	"The lights dimmed,the musical hall grew quiet and out walked the conductor shiny and white and 4 feet and 3 inches tall. ASIMO, a robot designed by Honda Motor Co., met its latest challenge Tuesday evening: Conducting the Detroit Symphony , in a performance of ""The Impossible Dream"" from ""Man of La Mancha"". ""Hello, everyone,"" ASIMO said to the audience in a childlike voice, then waved to the orchestra. As it conducted, it perfectly mimicked the actions of a conductor, nodding its head at various sections and gesturing with one or both hands. ASIMO took a final bow to excited shouts from the audience. Later, cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined ASIMO onstage to receive an award for his efforts in music education. Honda spokeswoman Alicia Jones says it is the first time ASIMO has conducted an orchestra, and it may be the first time any robot has conducted a live performance. But ASIMO has its limits. ASIMO's engineers programmed the robot to mimic Charles Burke, the Detroit Symphony's education director, as he conducted the piece in front of a pianist about six months ago. But it can't respond to the musicians. ""It's not a communicative device. It simply is programmed to do a set of gestures,"" said Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra's musical director. ""If the orchestra decides to go faster, there's nothing the robot can do about it. Hopefully, I keep that under control."" But several musicians also said ASIMO was more realistic than they expected. ""The movements are still a little stiff , but very humanlike, much better than I thought,"" Hutchinson said."

Whose birthday is it?	"David is eight. One day his friend Rose says to him, ""This Sunday is my birthday. Can you come to my birthday party?"" David says, ""Yes"". On Sunday, David asks his mother if he can go to the party. His mother says, ""Yes, you can go, but you must be polite. Don't ask for any food. They will give you some."" ""All right, Mum."" David answers and he goes to Rose's house on his bike. There are lots of kids at the party. They play together for some time, and then Rose's mother gives them some food, but she forgets David. He waits and waits and then he takes his plate up and asks, ""Do you want a nice clean plate?"""	"[""Rose's""]"
This passage is mainly about _ .	"Pocket money Most British parents give their teenagers pocker money. Teenagers get between PS7 and PS20 a week. They spend it on fast food, designer clothes, the cinema, concert, magazines and mobile phones. Lazy parents? 37% of parents pay teenagers to clean the lounge, 66% of parents pay teenagers to take the rubbish out. Lazy teens? 51% of teenagers don't make their beds before they leave home.Only 13% of teenagers wash the car for money.Some parents even pay their teenagers to do their homework. Equality? Not yet! Boys get more money than girls for most odd jobs.For washing the dishes, boys get about PS4 and girls get about PS1. And if you need some more money? Teens get an extra PS250 a year out of their parents on top of pocket money!About 50% of teens get gifts of money from their grandparents.Go to Mum if you need extra money!She gives more than Dad.

Which of the following might be a bed of proper length according to Phil Heinricy?	"While small may be beautiful, tall is just plain uncomfortable it seems, particularly when it comes to staying in hotels and eating in restaurants. The Tall Persons Club Great Britain (TPCGB), which was formed six months ago to campaign for the needs of the tall, has turned its attention to hotels and restaurants. Beds that are too small, shower heads that are too low, and restaurant tables with hardly any leg-room all make life difficult for those of above average height, it says. But it is not just the extra-tall whose needs are not being met. The average height of the population has been increasing yet the standard size of beds, doorways, and chairs has remained unchanged. ""The bedding industry says a bed should be six inches larger than the person using it, so even a king-size bed at 6'6'' (6 feet and 6 inches) is falling short for 25% of men, while the standard 6'3'' bed caters for less than half of the male population."" Said TPCGB president Phil Heinricy, ""seven-foot beds would work fine."" Similarly, restaurant tables can cause no end of problems. Small tables, which mean the long-legged have to sit a foot or so away from them, are enough to make tall customers go elsewhere. Some have already taken note, however. At Queens Moat Houses' Caledoman Hotel in Edinburgh, 6'6''beds are now put in as standard after requests for longer beds from taller visitors, particularly Americans."	"[""7'""]"
What is the best title for the passage?	For many years scientists have said that the earth is getting warmer. Now they have found something new-hot cities! In the southern US, they have found that cities become very hot in summer. For example, the city of Atlanta in Georgia has roof temperature of up to 50oC while it is 27degC in the streets! At night, the outside of buildings stays so hot that the heat of the city causes storms over the city! China also has the same kind of problems. Every year more farmland is used for factories or offices. More housing is needed, too. As people become richer, they buy more cars. New roads are needed and new car parks are built in the city centers. This all makes cities hotter. It isn't easy to change the situation. City planners say that we should plant more trees in the middle of cities. Every new street should have trees on both sides, they say. Trees make the temperature lower, so we should have more trees in our parks and squares. We should also paint our roofs white. If we do this, they do not become so hot. Every roof in a hot and sunny country should have solar roof panels. The electricity from these can be used to run the air conditioners in the buildings. People continue to cut down forests around the cities. This makes the problem worse. Cities are growing faster and faster. By the year 2025, four fifths of the population will be living in cities. If we go on like this, there will not be enough farmland to feed everyone in the world	['Cities Are Getting Hotter']
The study from Semmelweis University in Hungary intended to prove that _ .	"""You get excited about everything because you were born in the summer!"" Does that sound like something your grandparents used to say to you? Of course, you're a learned person who doesn't believe in such things. But scientists now say that it might not all be superstition . Researchers from Semmelweis University in Hungary recently asked 366 university students to fill out a questionnaire. The answers given included things like ""My mood often changes for no reason"", ""I love to deal with new projects, even if they're risky "", and ""I complain a lot"". They then compared students' answers to their birthdays. They found that the season of your birth may have some effect on who you are. Researchers found that people born in the summer were more likely to quickly change between sad and happy emotions. People born in the winter, however, were less likely to become angry. Spring birthdays were more likely to make people overly positive, while people born in autumn were less likely to be depressive . So, why could the seasons cause such differences? ""Biochemical studies have shown that the season in which you are born affects some monoamine neurotransmitters ,"" lead researcher Xenia Gonda said in a written statement. ""This led us to believe that birth season may have a longer-lasting effect."" Monoamine neurotransmitters are given off from neurones . They affect our emotions. So the researchers believe they might have an effect on the development of our personalities. Different seasons also have different food and nutrients to offer. In addition, mothers usually get more physical exercise and enjoy more sunlight in warm seasons than in cold seasons. All these are ""environmental factors "" which may influence a person's personality, said Gonda. But the research only included a survey and didn't follow participants over time. More research is needed before a final answer can be given on the connection between season and personality. Don't worry, though. Even if the connection is proven, it won't mean that your birth month completely decides who you are. Being happy or sad is up to you."

The city editor makes sure that the news in the city is covered and that as many local stories as possible get into each edition. The city editor monitors the local general assignment, beat and specialty reporters. The state editor supervises reporters who cover communities and areas outside the city but still within the circulation area of the newspaper. The national editor _ reporters in bureaus in cities outside the circulation area of the newspaper. Most newspapers rely on the wire services for national news, but some have correspondents who work in other cities and report to the national editor.	['the managing editor']
What is the best title of the text?	"Facebook is now used by 30 million people in the UK, around half the population. Joanna Shields, vice president of Facebook Europe, made the announcement this morning at a media conference in London. Globally, Facebook has more than 500 million registered users, a milestone it hit last summer. Last July it had 26 million registered UK users. In the last eight months, it has attracted four million extra UK users, bringing the UK total to 30 million. Facebook, the brainchild of Mark Zuckerberg while he was still studying at Harvard University, was launched in February 2004. The pace of its global growth has sped rapidly - Facebook had only 150 million registered users in January 2009. One third of women aged between 18 to 34 check Facebook when they first wake up, before even going to the toilet, according to the research. 21% check Facebook in the middle of the night, while 42% of the same group think it is fine to post drunken photos of themselves onto the social network, a study by Oxygen Media and Lightspeed Research found. Shields was speaking this morning at the Financial Times Digital Media and Broadcasting Conference about the power Facebook's referrals can bring to media sites, such as newspapers and TV services. She explained that the average Facebook user has 130 friends who they share links to media sites with regularly. ""Media companies which take advantage of that are really seeing the benefits,"" Shields said. Shields refused to be drawn on whether Facebook would develop its own mobile phone operating system and also said it was ""silly"" that Google had recently _ the feature which allowed Google users to refresh their contacts with Facebook friends."

The students from _ performed best in the test.	"Asia tops the OECD solving skills test QUESTION: Can you quickly learn to set a thermostat ? Don't look down upon such a task. It shows your ability to solve problems in creative ways, said the OECD . The OECD recently gave a problem-solving test to 85,000 students. They were all 15 years old, and from 44 countries. The test give each student four to eight everyday problems to solve. For example, they had to set a thermostat, and find the quickest way to a place. Students from Singapore and South Korea did the best job, said the OECD. They were quick learners, curious and able to solve problems that they were not familiar with. Students from Japan and China were also among the _ groups. They did a better job than those from countries like the US, Canada, Australia, the UK and France. Problem-solving skills are important, said the OECD.

From this passage we know that the news of Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in Literature was_.	"The breaking news of Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday evening soon aroused public curiosity of the 57-year-old Chinese writer: Why was he favored by the Swedish Academy? Less than half an hour after the announcement from Stockholm, Mo's works turned to ""sold out"" status at China's major online book sellers. One lucky buyer wrote in an online comment: ""Rushed to purchase, but to my shame, I have not read any of his novels."" Although Mo was entitled one of the top China's literature awards before the Nobel Prize, he is not the most popular novelist in China, in either the book market or in reputation. Chinese media seemed to be shocked as some journalists were reported to be on their way overnight to Gaomi City of East China's Shandong Province, Mo's birthplace where he stayed with his family. Born in 1955 into a rural family, Mo dropped out of school and became a farmer when he was a teenager. He joined the army and devoted himself to writing. Mo's novels were translated into several languages. For more than a century, Nobel Prize has been regarded by the world as recognition to an individual or even a nation's cultural and scientific advances. ""I think the reason why I could win the prize is that my works present lives with unique Chinese characteristics, and they also tell stones from a viewpoint of common human beings, which transcends differences of nations and races,"" Mo said on Thursday evening to Chinese journalists. Mo also said many folk arts originated from his hometown, such as paper cuts and traditional new year paintings, have inspired and influenced his novels. Mo's prize may give powerful encouragement to the country's writers as the more reflective of Chinese lives their works are, the more possible they arise as world literature."

What can we learn from the passage?	"Katie was in big trouble. She was such a sweet kid; a third-grade teacher always dreamed of having a classroom filled with Katies; she was never ever a discipline problem. I just couldn't imagine why she had made her parents so angry. It seemed that Katie had been running up sizable charges in the lunchroom. Her parents explained that Katie brought a great homemade lunch each day, and there was no reason for her to buy school lunch. They assumed a sit-down with Katie would solve the problem, but failed. So they asked me to help them get to the bottom of this situation. So the next day, I asked Katie to my office. ""Why are you charging lunches, Katie? What happened to your homemade lunch?"" I asked. ""I lose it,"" she responded. I leaned back in my chair and said, ""I don't believe you, Katie. "" She didn't care. ""Is someone stealing your lunch, Katie?"" I took a new track. ""No. I just lose it,"" she said. Well, there was nothing else I could do. The problem was still unsolved the next week when I noticed a boy who was new to the school sitting alone at a lunch table. He always looked sad. I thought I would go and sit with him for a while. As I walked towards him, I noticed the lunch bag on the table. The name on the bag said ""Katie"". Now I understood and I talked to Katie. It seemed that the new boy never brought a lunch, and he wouldn't go to the lunch line for a free lunch. He had told Katie his secret and asked her not to tell anyone that his parents wanted him to get a free lunch at school. Katie asked me not to tell her parents, but I drove to her house that evening after I was sure that she was in bed. I had never seen parents so proud of their child. Katie didn't care that her parents and teacher were disappointed in her. But she cared about a little boy who was hungry and scared. Katie still buys lunch every day at school. And every day, as she heads out of the door, her mom hands her a delicious homemade lunch."	"[""Katie's secret of lunch was discovered by the author by accident.""]"
According to the passage which of the following is not TRUE ?	"The crisis at the damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi Nuclear Power Station in northern Japan has raised worries about radiation risks. We spoke Tuesday with Jonathan Links, an expert in radiation health sciences. He is a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland. Professor Links says workers within the nuclear plant are the only people at risk of extremely high doses of radiation. JONATHAN LINKS: ""Of course, we don't know what doses they've received, but the only persons at risk of acute radiation effects are the workers."" For other people, he says, there may be a long-term worry. People can get cancer from low doses of ionizing radiation, the kind released in a nuclear accident. Professor Links says scientists can use computers to quickly model where radioactive material has blown and settled. Then they measure how large an area is contaminated. He says if the situation is serious enough, officials could take steps like telling people not to eat locally grown food or drink the water. JONATHAN LINKS: ""But that would only be the case if there was a significant release and, because of wind direction, the radioactive material was blown over the area, and then settled out of the air into and onto water, plants, fruits and vegetables."" The reactors at Fukushima are on the Pacific coast. But Professor Links says people should not worry about any radioactive material leaking into the ocean. JONATHAN LINKS: ""Even in a worst-case scenario accident, the sea provides a very high degree of _ . So the concentration of radioactivity in the seawater would still be quite low."" Japan is the only country to have had atomic bombs dropped on it. That memory from World War Two would create a stronger ""psychological sensitivity"" to radiation exposure, Professors Links says. Next month is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the explosion and fire that destroyed a reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine. The nineteen eighty-six event was the world's worst accident in the nuclear power industry. A new United Nations report says more than six thousand cases of thyroid cancer have been found. These are in people who were children in affected areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. The report says that by two thousand five the cancers had resulted in fifteen deaths. The cancers were largely caused by drinking contaminated milk. The milk came from cows that ate grass where radioactive material had fallen. To get the latest updates, go to www.unsv.com.

The example of a sugary soft drink in Paragraph 3 is given to show _ .	"As the saying goes, man struggles upwards; water flows downwards. Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans. But downhill isn't the only way that water moves .A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption. This flow isn't the type we usually think about .These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports. They call this a flow of ""virtual water "". We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap. However,92%of the water used by people goes into growing crops,according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra. He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats .These products are shipped around the world. For example, consider a sugary soft drink. Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half-liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water--about 95%--is used to grow and process the ingredients .Another 4%goes into the packaging and labeling. In Hoekstra's calculation, when one country produces a half-liter of soda and sells it abroad,it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator. According to Hoekstra's new report,dry countries like Israel and Kuwait,both in the Middle East,get the majority of their virtual water from other countries,through imported products. More surprisingly, some wetter countries,like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, also get the majority of their virtual water from other places. That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries. In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources .In China even less of the water associated with its products."	['how virtual water is used']

Animals' living on generation after generation depends on_.	"From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions . It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating , and which are to be avoided ; when to attack and when to run away . The animal is , in fact , playing a very dangerous game with its environment , a game in which it must make decision--a matter of life or death . Animals' ability to act reasonably is believed to come partly from what we may call ""genetic learning"" , which is different from the individual learning that an animal does in the course of its own lifetime . Genetic learning is learning by a species --animals of the same kind--as a whole , and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to act in the right way . However , the role of genetic learning depends upon how similar the future environment is to the past . The more important individual experience is likely to be , the less important is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game . Because most animals live in ever changing evironments from one generation to the next , it is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning . In the great majority of animals , their particular ways of acting in a new environment are a compound of individual experience added to the action patterns animals are born with .That is why animals can survive ."

Which city is not included in the six cities?	The Chinese mainland and Taiwan today extended the number of regular cross-Straits direct passenger flights from 108 to 270 a week. Six cities, which are Hefei, Harbin, Nanchang, Guiyang, Ningbo and Jinan, are joining another 21 mainland cities in operating direct passenger flights to Taiwan, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said. The 108 direct passenger flights previously operated were all classed as chartered flights. The new services will contain both regular chartered and scheduled flights. Among the 27 designated mainland terminals , 25 will launch scheduled direct passenger flights from Monday to Saturday, to Taipei's Taoyuan or Kaohsiung airports. Scheduled direct _ flights will belaunched between Shanghai, Guangzhou on the mainland and Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, which will bring the total number of weekly chartered and scheduled cargo flights to 28, according to the CAAC. The mainland and Taiwan began direct air and sea transport links and postal services on Dec 15 last year. Previously, air and sea connections, including mail, were routed through a third location, usually Hong Kong. On Nov 4 last year, the mainland and Taiwan agreed to regular direct passenger charter flights across the Straits. Before that, flights were only offered on weekends and during the country's four major traditional festivals - the Spring Festival, Tomb-Sweeping Day, Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival.

What would be the best title of the text?	"My school has no cafeteria . Students bring their own lunches and eat in the classroom with their teachers. At first, I didn't think I needed to be ""on"" during lunch, since it was technically a free time for students. However, I was surprised to learn that even in a classroom with fewer students, social segregation happened. The entire class crowded around a table just to avoid one or two other students sitting by themselves on the other side of the room. Students refer to one as the ""cool"" one and another as the ""loser"". There were only three tables. After witnessing this, I made a new classroom rule. Every day at lunch, we would put all the tables together and everyone including me would sit around the big table. Students could sit wherever they wanted at the table. This way, no one was excluded from the group. At first, there was much grumbling at this. But gradually the complaining stopped. Students who didn't usually talk to each other during free time started to share conversations. Students were occasionally requested to bring something for others to taste. This started a new tradition: weekly food sharing. In other situations, students make unpleasant comments about their classmate's food, but not during these lunches. Students were careful to thank the sharer, even if they didn't like the offering. Many students tried a food they had never tried before and some cooked a family recipe with their parents for the first time. Eating together gave us the opportunity to practice social graces . Students learned to ask about and respect each other's food choices. They also gained knowledge about their classmates' lives and cultures by tasting each other's food and practicing open-mindedness."	['My new classroom rule']
The duck in the story _ .	There is a brown female Canadian duck that weighs only four hundred fifty grams. The duck had flown to the southern state of Florida for the winter.A hunter shot it on January fifteenth and took it to his home in the city of Tallahassee.He put it in the refrigerator .Two days later the man's wife opened the refrigerator door.The duck lifted its head and looked at her.It was alive! The family took the duck to a doctor who treats animals.The doctor gave the duck to the Goose Creek Animal Sanctuary .Animal sanctuaries provide homes for animals and teach people about their care. The doctor said it was easy to understand why people thought the duck was dead. He said ducks generally do not move a 1ot,especially after being shot.And he said its low body temperature helped it survive in the refrigerator. _ was enough to make the duck famous around the world.The Tallahassee newspaper published the story that was re-printed in many different countries.But that was not the end of the story. Workers at the wildlife sanctuary named the duck Perky.And they got the doctor to give an operation to repair the duck's damaged wing.During the operation,Perky stopped breathing--not just once but two times.The doctor tried to save Perky by giving her oxygen.But he finally said the duck had died.A few seconds later, however, Perky began to move.Reports say the people in the operating room were so happy that they cried. Workers at the wildlife sanctuary say Perky will not have any more operations. It seems the drugs that were used had side-effects on her.Perky is expected to live at the sanctuary.And a local company has begun to sell T-shirts showing a picture of the lucky duck. Money from the sale of the shirts will help pay for Perky's care.	['was considered dead before being put in the refrigerator']
How many examples does the author offer to describe the future life?	"When a magazine for high school students asked its readers what life would be like in twenty years, they said: Machines would be run by solar power. Buildings would rotate so they could follow the sun to take maximum advantage of its light and heat. Walls would ""give light"" and ""change color with the push of a button."" Food would be replaced by pills. School would be taught by electrical impulse while we sleep. Cars would have radar . Does this sound like the year 2000? Actually, this article was written in 1958 and the question was, ""what will life be like in 1978? The future is much too important to simply guess about, the way the high school students did, so experts are regularly asked to predict accuately. By carefully studying the present, skilled businessmen, scientists, and politicians are supposedly able to figure out in advance what will happen. But can they? One expert on Cities wrote: Cities of the future would not be crowded, but would have space for farms and fields. People would travel to work in ""airbuses"", large all-weather helicopters carrying up to 200 passengers. When a person left the airbus station he could drive a coin-operated car equipped with radar. The radar equipment of cars would make traffic accidents ""almost unheard of"". Does that sound familiar? If the expert had been accurate it would, because he was writing in 1957. His subject was ""The city of 1982"". If the professionals sometimes sound like high school students, it's probably because future study is still a new field. But economic forecasting, or predicting what the economy will do, has been around for a long time. It should be accuate, and generally it is. But there have been some big mistakes in the field, too. In early 1929, most forecasters saw an excellent future for the stock market. In October of that year, the stock market had its worst losses ever, ruining thousands of investors who had put their faith in financial foreseers. One forecaster knew that predictions about the future would always be subject to significant error. In 1957, H.J. Rand of the Rad corporation was asked about the year 2000, ""Only one thing is certain,"" he answered. ""Children born today will have reached the age of 43."""	['Four']

What is Cleveland?	"Sweetest Day is celebrated on the third Saturday in October as a day to make someone happy. It is an occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to remember not only the sick, the aged, and children who have lost their parents, but also friends, workmates, s and neighbors whose helpfulness and kindness we have enjoyed. Over 60 years ago, when a Cleveland man noticed that some people, such as children who lost their parents and patients who lay in bed, too often felt forgotten and _ , he developed in his mind the idea of showing them that they were remembered. He did this by giving them small gifts. With the help of his friends and neighbors, he gave those people small gifts on a Saturday in October. During the years that followed, other Clevelanders began to take part in the celebration, which came to be called ""Sweetest Day"". Over time, the Sweetest Day idea of spreading cheer to the poor, the sick and children who had lost their parents was broadened to include everyone, and became an occasion for remembering others with a kind act or a small gift. Soon the idea spread to other cities all over the USA. Sweetest Day is not based on any single group's religious beliefs or on a family relationship. It is a reminder that a thoughtful word or deed enriches life and gives it meaning. Because for many people remembering takes the form of gift giving, Sweetest Day offers us the opportunity to show others that we care, in a positive way."	['A city in America.']

Tom,who proudly put the letter on his wall,wrote back to say that his great,great grandfather,the artist Petrus Johannes Arundzen,had been commissioned to copy Dutch masters' on display at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. Angela at once replied that she would contact the Royal Collection to find out what had happened to the art works.She kept her word and two weeks later wrote to Tom to tell him what had happened to the _ ,explaining they now form part of the print collection in the Print Library.

Which statement is true according to the passage?	"Kincaid looked at his watch: eight-seventeen. The truck started on the second try, and he backed out, shifted gears, and moved slowly down the alley under hazy sun. Through the streets of Bellingham he went, heading south on Washington 11, running along the coast of Puget Sound for a few miles, then following the highway as it swung east a little before meeting U.S Route 20. Turning into the sun, he began the long, winding drive through the Cascades. He liked this country and felt unstressed stopping now and then to make notes about interesting possibilities for future expeditions or to shoot what he called ""memory snapshots."" The purpose of these causal photographs was to remind him of places he might want to visit again and approach more seriously. In later afternoon he turned north at Spokane, picking up U.S. Route 2, which would take him halfway across the northern United States to Duluth, Minnesota. He wished for the thousandth time in his life that he had a dog, a golden retriever, maybe, for travels like this and to keep him company at home. But he was frequently away; overseas much of the time and it would not be fair to the animal. Still, he thought about it anyway. In a few years he would be getting too old for the hard fieldwork. ""I must get a dog then."" He said to himself. Drives like this always put him into a sentimental mood. The dog was part of it. Robert Kincaid was alone as it's possible to be--an only child, parents both dead, distant s who had lost track of him and he of them, no close friends. He thought about Marian. She had left him nine years ago after five years of marriage. He was fifty-two now, that would make her just under forty. Marian had dreams of becoming a musician, a folksinger. She knew all of the Weavers' songs and sang them pretty well in the coffeehouse of Seattle. When he was home in the old days, he drove her to the shows and sat in the audience while she sang. His long absences--two or three months sometimes--were hard on the marriage. He knew that. She was aware of what he did when they decided to get married, and both of them had a vague(not clear) sense that it could all be handled somehow. It couldn't when he came from photographing a story in Iceland and, she was gone. The note read, ""Robert, it didn't work out, I left you the Harmony guitar. Stay in touch."" He didn't stay in touch, neither did she. He's signed the divorce papers when they arrived a year later and caught a plane for Australia the next day. She had asked for nothing except her freedom."	"[""Kincaid would have had a dog if he hadn't been away from home too much.""]"
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Robots are being used for the first time in hospitals. ""Robot-nurses"" perform a variety of tasks such as delivering medicine, food and laboratory samples to sickrooms and taking away waste. Patients aren't treated by robots, as this is still done by medical staff. The idea is to employ robots to transport supplies between departments. ""Nurses often have to break off from what they are doing to gather supplies,"" says Peter Seiff, who makes the robots called TUGs. Research shows any interruption in medical work can lead to errors --- a nurse may forget whether she has given medicine and may give a patient double the dose or none at all. The robots vary in size according to what job they perform, but normally take the shape of a metal box on wheels, with a box on the side containing their software. After being programmed, the robots are able to find their way around a hospital unassisted. They also contain scanning technology to create electronic pictures or a ""memory"" of routes on their hard drives to help them go through passages, doors and other obstacles. Each robot is also monitored at the producer's headquarters in case it runs into any difficulties. Trials show TUGs reduce the time it takes for a patient to receive medicine, and stop drugs from going missing. A study at the University of Maryland Medical Centre in the U.S. found that when three TUGs were used over the course of a year, the average length of time from the drugstore receiving a prescription to the patient receiving it dropped from 74 minutes to 30 minutes and saved nurses 6,123 hours finding medicines. It also cut the number of medicines that went missing to zero. ""The biggest complaints we receive from patients is that the nurses don't spend enough time with them. Anything that frees nurses is a _ ,"" says Katherine Mulligan, director of nursing at the hospital, ""The TUGs allow nurses to spend more time focusing on patient care. Nurse satisfaction has improved."""	['Robots can help nurses save a lot of time.']
What was the 'disaster'?	Daniel Olin was 11 years old when his parents moved to Canada. He liked his new school and made friends there, but then things at home started to change. His mum and dad began to argue and the arguments got worse and worse until one day, Daniel's mum left. With his father working long hours, Daniel felt very lonely and very unhappy. He wanted to escape, to run away. And that's what he did. Very early one terribly cold morning when the snow was deep on the ground, he packed a bag with some clothes, some chocolate and a map of Canada and set off to a forest. He ran and ran until he could hardly breathe. His feet were heavy with the snow but he still walked on through deep snow, not even watching where he was going. Then, disaster struck. A rock hidden by the deep snow caught his feet and Daniel fell to the ground. He had broken the bone. He was very cold and was starting to feel tired, but he knew that if he fell asleep in the snow, he would certainly die from the cold. A tree shook ahead. From within the branches , a pair of yellow eyes watched Daniel. The puma had been following him. A puma is a large wild cat with claws that could tear Daniel into pieces. But instead of moving in for the kill, the puma walked up to Daniel and lay across his chest, arms and legs. Daniel was too frightened to move, but soon the warmth of the animal reached Daniel and he began to feel better. From time to time, the puma pressed his muzzle against Daniel and rocked his head gently. Clearly, the puma knew that Daniel must not fall asleep. This animal should have been a real danger to Daniel and yet the boy began to feel safe. They remained like that for several hours until Daniel and the puma heard voices. The rescue team had found them.	['Daniel fell down and got hurt.']
What was people's attitude towards crying over novels in the early 18th century?	"What does it mean to cry over a book? ""I'm a reader who did not weep,"" Ruth Graham, a well-known critic, wrote. ""Does this make me heartless? Or does it make me a grown-up?"" Tears have played a surprisingly important part in the history of the novel. Readers have always asked about the role that emotion plays in reading: What does it mean to be deeply moved by a book? Which books are worthy objects of our feelings? In different times, people answered those questions in different ways. In the early eighteenth century, when the novel was still a new form, crying was a sign of readers' virtue. ""Sentimental"" novels, full of touching scenes, gave readers an occasion to exercise their ""finer feelings."" Your tear proved that you were likely to feel the suffering of others. At that time, sentimental novels were hugely popular, but also easy to attack. Tears, after all, had no necessary connection to actual virtue, and they could be not true As the critic John Mullan points out, by the end of the eighteenth century, the word ""sentimental"" had acquired a new meaning -- ""addicted to low emotion"" -- bringing it closer to the meaning that it has for us today. In the nineteenth century, the meaning of tears evolved in two different directions. Some writers sought to waken ""higher"" feelings in their readers: Victorian sentimentalists wrote touching scenes in an effort to inspire social and political reform. However, the ""sensation"" novel, a different type of Victorian best-seller, showed that tears could be enjoyable in themselves. Sensation novels were the leaders of the modern thriller and mystery. Heavy on secrets, and madness, they were known for creating physical ""sensations"" in their readers -- trembling, a fast beating heart, and tears. But these were tears without moral purpose or effect. Today's debate about crying while reading looks back on all of this history. The debate, in fact, is about why books matter to us, and what reading is ""for."" Talking about what makes us cry is a way of talking about ourselves."	['Positive.']
From the passage, what can we infer ?	"A few minutes before six o'clock, Mr. Smith decided to leave. He was about to start the car when a gunman jumped up from the back seat. He held a gun to Mr. Smith's head. ""Drive me to Paris!"" he shouted. ""All right"", Mr. Smith answered. He started the engine, pulled away from the side of the street and drove down. Being eighty-one years old, he knew he could not fight the gunman. He knew he needed help. Where were the police? As he drove through a crossing, he looked up and down the side streets, hoping to meet a police car. But he could see nothing. ""Just my luck,"" he thought, ""If I was driving too fast, there would be a police car on every corner."" Suddenly he pushed his foot down on the accelerator , and the car ran much faster. ""What are you doing?"" shouted the gunman. ""Keeping off the police,"" Mr. Smith answered. ""I thought I saw a police car back there."" He ran lights, drove the wrong way on one-way streets. On two-way streets he drove on the wrong side of the road. Not one policeman saw him. Again Mr. Smith's plan was not working. He had to try a new plan. He turned a corner and saw the police station in front. Then he drove his car as fast as he could towards the police gate. The car hit a police motorbike down and stopped. Mr. Smith shouted, ""Help! Help!"" Then he reached back to grab the man's gun. At the same time the policeman heard the noise and quickly caught the gunman."	['Mr. Smith is a wise man.']
What does the passage mainly tell us?	George Washington Carver showed that plant life was more than just food for animals and humans. Carver's first step was to analyze plant parts to find out what they were made of. He then combined these simpler isolated substances with other substances to create new products. The branch of chemistry that studies and finds ways to use raw materials from farm products to make industrial products is called chemurgy. Carver was one of the first and greatest chemurgists of all time. Today the science of chemurgy is better known as the science of synthetics . Each day people depend on and use synthetics made from raw materials. All his life Carver battled against the disposal of waste materials, and warned of the growing need to develop substitutes for the natural substances being used up by humans. Carver never cared about getting credit for the new products he created. He never tried to patent his discoveries or get wealthy from them. He turned down many offers to leave Tuskegee Institute to become a scientist in private industry. Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric light, offered him a laboratory in Detroit to carry out food research. When the United States government made him a collaborator in the Mycology and Plant Disease Survey of the Department of Agriculture, he accepted the position with the understanding that he wouldn't leave Tuskegee. An authority on plant disease--especially of the fungus variety--Carver sent hundreds of specimens to the United States Department of Agriculture. At the peak of his career, Carver's fame and influence were known on every continent.	['It mainly tells us about Gorge Washington Carver, a great chemurgist.']
We want to have nice neighbours because _ .	"When we buy a house, we all want to have nice neighbours, because most of us think that it is helpful to live with some good neighbours. But what kind of neighbour is good? The answers are different from people to people. Here are my answers. First, it is very important to respect each other. If our neighbours try to know more about our life, what will we feel? He or she may also talk with others about our life. Do you want to live with him or her any more? The answer is ""No"". We will feel very sad to have this kind of neighbour and move away quickly. Next, a good neighbour is always ready to give us a hand when we need him or her. For example, if we are not at home, our good neighbours will watch our house for us. Finally, a good neighbour should love the environment . He or she never puts rubbish here and there. Good neighbours should keep the place clean, because the good environment can make us comfortable and happy. I think we all should learn to be good neighbours, and I also hope everyone will have good neighbours and live a happy life."	['it is helpful to live with good neighbours.']
According to the text, writing can help you a lot in the following ways EXCEPT _ .	"Have you ever noticed what happens to an idea once you express it? Just talking about it or writing it down causes you to make it clear in your own mind.How can you use this to increase your brain power? Start writing. By putting thoughts into words, you are telling yourself the logic behind what you think, feel, or only partly understand.Often, explaining a thought is the process of understanding.In other words, you increase your brain power by exercising your ""explain power."" Try this experiment.Explain how you'll increase your brain power, even if you have no idea how right now.Just start with anything, and create an explanation.For example, start with ""I'll learn chess,"" or ""I'll read an article on the mind every week."" Explain how that will help.You'll be surprised how often this becomes a workable plan, and if you actually do this, you'll have a better understanding of your brain twenty minutes from now. Another benefit of writing is that it helps you remember.Many, if not most, highly productive people are always taking notes.You can try keeping it all in your head, but if you keep a journal of your ideas the next time you're working on a big project, you'll probably have more success. Want to understand a topic? Write a book about it.That's an extreme example, but if you are learning something new, write a letter to a friend about it, and you will understand it better.Want to invent something? Write an explanation of the problem, why you want to solve it, and why it is worth solving, and you're half-way there. Writers don't always write because they clearly understand something beforehand.Often, they write about something because they want to understand it.You can do the same.Writing will help bring you to an understanding.Give it a try."

According to the passage, a happy person is most probably	""" To seek happiness is to look for it"" was once said by the famous French author Jules Renard. Look for it? Sure...but don't spend a lifetime trying, especially if it's well within your reach but you're just too blind to see it. Discover the three keys to happiness that you have already understood, but that you are just too afraid to find it. 1. Accepting Yourself The idea of happiness is difficult to understand if you are not at peace with yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are. Your next step will be to improve your attitude for tomorrow, for the next day, for the day after that, and so forth. By beginning to accept reality, you will come to the final point of true happiness. Only when you are at peace with yourself, will you finally be able to admit that you are, in fact, a happy person. 2. Forgiving Others Forgiving others is a true show of humanity which also allows us to feel more at ease. When you learn to forgive, you also learn to keep a firm hold on your life. To forgive is to open the doors of personal satisfaction. Yet you simply open your mind to answer, "" Do I really want to allow my anger to grow and eat me from inside out?"" 3. Helping Your Neighbors When a friend seems to be suffering from a state of depression , it's quite easy to help him or her out of the trouble. The best attitude to have in this situation is to make him or her understand that he or she is not alone. If you come to save a friend in need, you'll feel a lot more at peace with yourself. You will feel high--spirited by knowing that someone is looking at life on the brighter side thanks to your kind words. ,."	['a kind helper']
When the Western Hemisphere is having day, the Eastern Hemisphere is having _ .	"The word ""day"" has two meanings. When we talk about the number of days in a year, we are using ""day"" to mean 24 hours. But when we talk about day and night, we are using ""day"" to mean the time between sunrise and sunset. Since the earth looks like a ball, the sun can shine on only half of it at a time. Always one half of the earth is having day and the other half night. A place is moved from day into night and from night into day over and over by the spinning of the earth. At the equator day and night are sometimes the same length. They are each twelve hours long. The sun rises at 6 in the morning and sets at 6 in the evening. For six months the North Pole is tilted toward the sun. In those months the Northern Hemisphere gets more hours of sunlight than the Southern Hemisphere. Days are longer than nights. South of the equator nights are longer than days. For the other six months the North Pole is tilted away from the sun. Then the Southern Hemisphere gets more sunlight. Days are longer than night. North of the equator nights are longer than days. Winter is the season of long nights. Summer is the season of long days."	['night']
Whose garden is the best?	Mr. Green has a small garden in front of his house. There are lots of flowers in it. But he has only a few trees. His neighbor Mr. Black has a garden, too. Mr. Black's garden is smaller than Mr. Green 's garden. He has fewer flowers than Mr Green but more trees. Mr. Brown is Mr. Green's another neighbour. Mr. Brown's garden is the smallest one of the three. He has the fewest flowers of them all, but the weeds in his garden are the tallest. There is always a lot of work to do in his garden, but Mr. Brown doesn't have enough time to work in his garden, so his garden is the worst.	"[""We don't know""]"
Bergqvist designed and built the world's first igloo hotel because _ .	"Holidaymakers who are bored with baking beaches and overheated hotel rooms head for a big igloo. Swedish businessman Nile Bergqvist is delighted with his new hotel, the world's first igloo hotel. Built in a small town in Lapland, it has been attracting lots of visitors, but soon the fun will be over. In two weeks' time Bergqvist's ice creation will be nothing more than a pool of water. ""We don't see it as a big problem,"" he says. ""We just look forward to replacing it."" Bergqvist built his first igloo in 1991 for an art exhibition. It was so successful that he designed the present one, which measures roughly 200 square meters. Six workmen spent more than eight weeks piling 1,000 tons of snow onto a wooden base; when the snow froze, the base was removed. ""The only wooden thing we have left in the igloo is the front door,"" he says. After their stay, all visitors receive a survival certificate recording their success. With no windows, nowhere to hang clothes and temperatures below 0degC, it may seem more like a survival test than a relaxing hotel break. ""It's great fun,"" Bergqvist explains, ""As well as a good start in survival training."" The popularity of the igloo is beyond doubt: it is now attracting tourists from all over the world. At least 800 people have stayed at the igloo this season even though there are only 10 rooms. ""You can get a lot of people in,"" explains Bergqvist. ""The beds are three meters wide by two meters long, and can fit at least four at one time."""	['he believed people would enjoy trying something new']
Why did Loftus ask the volunteers to answer some questions?	"A study published in September suggests there is a surprising way to get people to avoid unhealthy foods: change their memories. Scientist Elizabeth Loftus of the University of California at Irvine asked volunteers to answer some questions on their personalities and food experiences. ""One week later,"" Loftus says, ""we told those people we'd fed their answers into our smart computer and it came up with an account of their early childhood experiences."" Some accounts included one key additional detail. ""You got sick after eating strawberry ice-cream."" The researchers then changed this detail into a manufactured memory through leading questions --- Who were you with? How did you feel? By the end of the study, up to 41% of those given a false memory believed strawberry ice-cream once made them sick, and many said they'd avoid eating it. When Loftus published her findings, she started getting calls from people begging her to make them remember hating chocolate or French fries. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. False memories appear to work only for foods you don't eat on a regular basis. But most importantly, it is likely that false memories can be implanted only in people who are unaware of the mental control. And lying to a patient is immoral , even if a doctor believes it's for the patient's benefit. Loftus says there's nothing to stop parents from trying it with their overweight children. ""I say, wake up --- parents have been lying about Father Christmas for years, and nobody seems to mind. If they can prevent diseases caused by fatness and all the other problems that come with that, you might think that's more moral lie. Decide that for yourself."""

What is the purpose of the passage?	In Asia,there are many places for people to go to teach English. Most of the teachers are young and sociable,and there are a lot of parties there. Korea is usually the place most people go,because they have the most benefits and highest salaries by working only twenty hours a week. Japan is also a good choice,but only if you stay there for a long time will you save some money. China is a new rising star and lots of people are going there. Like Japan,the pay is quite good,but the cost of living in China is much cheaper. You can save a sizable amount and complete all your loans back home. Besides,Chinese people are enterprising and you can learn a lot from them. In China,Taiwan is a good place to go,especially for females who want to earn much,but there are not many adult classes offered. The Middle East offers very high salaries and great packages for teachers,all of which is tax free. However,you must be a certified teacher and have a few years' experience if you want to teach there. Most of the people who tend to teach there are older and more conservative,so they don't expect a party scene. Italy and Spain are two beautiful countries where you can try your fortune. Fashion industry in Milan would love to hire wellknown Englishspeaking people to work with international models and designers. Tourism is another industry in these countries,where English knowledge is useful. Moreover,by teaching in Europe you have the ability to travel every weekend to a new country and visit a new culture besides a good salary. Europe has a lot to offer. Teaching English overseas is a really rewarding experience. It is a great way for people to see a new place,and these countries and places are a great place for you to go if you are interested.

The author's consultant was angry with him because _ .

What are you worried about?""she asked.I hesitated.She was obviously very involved in his care and it was only fair that I told her the truth.""Well.we need to prove it's not cancer.""I said and talked briefly about some of the tests I was going to order.

As it turned out, it wasn't cancer.But I did learn that when someone is stressed and worried about their loved one they're sometimes selective in what they hear and as a doctor it's important to be mindful of this.In being truthful,I'd made the situation worse."

According to the passage, which of the following is not the cause of severe water shortage?	"prefix = st1 /Gland, Switzerland - Rivers on every continent are drying out, threatening severe water shortages, according to a new WWF report. The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. ""All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,"" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. ""Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later."" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. ""Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,"" Pittock adds. ""Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary."" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given the resources to make them work, says WWF. ""The freshwater crisis is bigger than the ten rivers listed in this report but it mirrors the extent to which unabated development is _ nature's ability to meet our growing demands,"" says Pittock. ""We must change our mindset now or pay the price in the not so distant future.""(373)"	['Less rainfall']

When Paul was a boy, _ .	"When Paul was a boy growing up in Utah, he happened to live near a copper smelter , and the chemicals that poured out had made a wasteland out of what used to be a beautiful forest. One day a young visitor looked at this wasteland and called it an awful area. Paul knocked him down. From then on, something happened inside him. Years later Paul was back in the area, and he went to the smelter office. He asked if they had any plans or if they would let him try to bring the trees back. The answer from that big industry was ""No."" Paul then went to college to study the science of plants. Unfortunately, his teachers said there weren't any birds or squirrels to spread the seeds. It would be a waste of his life to try to do it. He was told everyone knew that even if he was knowledgeable as he had expected, he wouldn't get his idea accepted. Paul later got married and had some kids. But, his dream would not die. And then one night he did what he could with what he had. Under the cover of darkness, he went secretly into the wasteland and started planting. And every week, he made his secret journey into the wasteland and planted trees and grass. For fifteen years he did this against _ . Slowly rabbits appeared. Later, as there was legal pressure to clean up the environment, the company actually hired Paul to do what he was already doing. Now the place is fourteen thousand acres of trees and grass and bushes, and Paul has received almost every environmental award Utah has. It took him until his hair turned white, but he managed to keep that impossible vow he made to himself as a child."	['he had determined to stop the copper smelter polluting the area']
Why is Mrs. Reed bitter towards Jane?	Jane arrives at Thornfield, having been met at the George Inn. Mrs. Fairfax confuses her a little at first, because _ is so informal and welcoming. But in due course Jane discovers that Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation , but without success; her aunt dies that night.	['Because Mr. Reed loved Jane more than his own children.']
What is the audience's reaction to the social problems that Jerry Springer talks about?	"TV talk shows dominate daytime television. And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one is different in style. But no two shows are more opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows. Jerry Springer could easily be considered the king of ""rubbish talk"". The contents on his show are as surprising as possible. For example, the show takes the forever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives. Like Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its top, but Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and the quality of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors. Compared with Oprah, the Jerry Springer looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a ""final word"". He makes a small speech about the main idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable. Clear as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main viewers are middle-class Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and ability to deal with life's tougher problems. The Jerry Springer show, on the other hand, has more of connection with the young adults of society. These are 18-to-21-year-olds whose main troubles in life include love, relationship, sex, money and drugs. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned through the show's exploitation (,)."	['They are interested in them.']
In the writer's opinion, a good stage school should _ .	"When a group of children politely stop a conversation with you, saying: ""We have to go to work now,"" you're left feeling surprised and certainly uneasy. After all, this is the 1990s and the idea of children working is just unthinkable. That is, until you are told that they are all pupils of stage schools, and that the ""work"" they go off to is to go on the stage in a theatre. Stage schools often act as agencies to supply children for stage and television work. More worthy of the name ""stage school"" are those few places where children attend full time, with a training for the theatre and a general education. A visit to such schools will leave you in no doubt that the children enjoy themselves. After all, what lively children wouldn't settle for spending only half the day doing ordinary school work, and acting, singing or dancing their way through the other half of the day? Then of course there are times for the children to make a name and make a little money in some big shows. Some stage schools give their children too much professional work at such a young age. But the law is very tight on the amount they can do. Those under 13 are limited to 40 days in the year; those over 13 to 80 days. The schools themselves admit that not all children will be successful in the profession for which they are being trained. So what happens to those who don't make it? While all the leading schools say they place great importance on children getting good study results, the facts seem to suggest this is not always the case."

The author dreamed of being a pilot when _ .	My passion started decades ago as a kid on a flight to India. I was attracted by how such a large airplane was able to glide smoothly above the clouds. I made it a goal to become a pilot. I am now a pilot for American airlines. Though being a pilot consumes my life,it is a job worth doing. My job is slightly different compared to that of a typical pilot. Most pilots have their routes they fly. They then familiarize(...)themselves with the routes. However, in my case,I participate in any job where a pilot is immediately required. It is true that some days I might have a workday from nine in the morning to five in the afternoon. In fact,some days,I might even begin my work at three in the morning when I am needed to fly. Sometimes, as for the typical day,I do not have one. Having been on the job for over two decades,I have learned some important life lessons. As I greet passengers boarding the airplane,I realize I,along with other airline pilots, have enhanced the lives of those who we are serving. In fact, there is one particular experience that I will never forget. A family was walking in from the gate, explaining that their beloved one was ill and had to be taken to a big hospital in another city immediately. It was at this point that I realized just how important my job was. Therefore, my life as an airline pilot is definitely not for everyone. However,my job is something I enjoy thoroughly and will continue to do till I am old enough. As a pilot, I have been able to experience so many different types of situations in different places throughout the world. For anyone interested in piloting, I would recommend going for it.

The purpose of the passage is to _ .	"Some years ago, a Miami woman walking through an office building noticed two men standing together.Several minutes after her leaving, the men murdered a person working in the building.The police determined that the woman was the only witness and could possibly describe them.However, her memory of the men proved disappointingly unclear.Several days later, psychologist Ronald Fisher was brought in to obtain a more complete account from the woman.His interview produced a breakthrough--the woman reported a clear picture of one of the suspects.The important information enabled the police to arrest the suspect and close the case. The police asked Fisher for help because of his rich knowledge in cognitive interview, a kind of memory - rebuilding process.Memory researchers have found that people trying to remember a past event often only recall part of the relevant information.Human memory is selective and it is often _ by stress.But a person's accurate recall of an event or understanding of a question can be improved using specific interviewing techniques.The ""cognitive interview"" was developed in the late 1990s.It encourages the witness to take an active role in recalling information rather than giving answers only to someone else's questions.The witness first describes what happened in his or her own words, with no interviewer interruptions.The interviewer then goes further with specific techniques, such as having the witness tell the details of what happened from different perspectives . The cognitive interview focuses on guiding witnesses through four general recalling techniques: thinking about physical surroundings and personal feelings that existed at the time of past events; reporting everything that connects to mind about those events, no matter how broken it is retelling events in a variety of time orders, such as from beginning to end, end to beginning, forward or backward; and adopting different perspectives while recalling events. Experiments with police detectives trained in this demanding interview method find that they obtain nearly 50% more information from witnesses than before training, while error rates remain about the same.It is proved that cognitive interviews are quite important tools in improving the accuracy and completeness of witness testimony ."

The students in Hangzhou Yongjin Middle School had an activity about _ .	"What is the hottest topic at your school? In Hangzhou Yongjin Middle School, it's money. The school had an activity called ""making a living"" recently. About 800 Junior 1 and Junior 2 students were divided into 112 teams. They went out to make money by selling things. What did they choose to sell? Some sold newspapers; some chose bottled water; some sold environmentally friendly shopping bags and bamboo baskets. Huqi's team decided to sell educational books in front of the Children Activity Centre. They thought parents would like to buy books for their children. But unfortunately , they came across urban management officers . The officers asked them to leave. ""We played hide-and-seek with the officers for the whole morning,"" said Hu. ""Finally we gave up and moved to other place. Wang Yongyi and her team sold ice cream in a square. They didn't meet any officers. But few people were interested in what they were selling. The team then put up a board saying the money was to help the ""Project Hope"" for country kids. It worked. More people came to their stall. A foreigner even gave them 100 yuan. Meng Zhaoxiang and his team were luckier. They sold all their cakes in four hours, spending 39.5 yuan and getting back 80 yuan. ""It was not easy to make the money,"" said Meng. ""Some people just looked. Others just tasted but didn't buy. Now I know how hard it is for our parents to earn the money we need to lead happy lives."""	['earning money']
According to the passage, removing chlorine from water _	"About 1 in 15 households drink bottled water today, spending about $ 4 billion a year on it. Although the reasons for the trend are many, bottled water's health benefits fall near the top of the list. Surveys have found that about 25 percent of bottled water drinkers choose the beverage for health and safety reasons; another quarter believe it is pure and free of contaminants . Regardless of its pristine image, bottled water is not necessarily any purer or more healthful than what flows right out of the tap. Consider that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the bottled water industry watchdog, does not require that bottled water meet higher standards for quality, such as the maximum level of contaminants, than public water supplies regulated by the EPA. For the most part, the FDA simply follows EPA's regulatory lead. Granted, bottled water is often filtered to remove chemicals such as chlorine that may impart a certain taste. But that doesn't make it any safer. In fact, about 25 to 40 percent of bottled water comes from the same municipal water supplies as tap water. Furthermore, some bottled waters do not contain any or enough of the fluoride needed to fight cavities. The only way to determine whether a certain water contains the mineral is to check with the company that bottles it. This is not to say that bottled water is necessarily any better or worse, from a health standpoint, than tap water. It's certainly preferable to tap water for those who like its taste. The problem is that many consumers pay 300 to 1,200 times more per gallon for bottled water than for tap water because they think bottled water is the more healthful of the two. Bottlers add to the confusion by sprinkling terms such as ""pure"", ""crystal pure"" and ""premium"" on labels illustrated with pictures of glaciers, mountain streams, and waterfalls, even when the water inside comes from a public reservoir. However, the FDA has set forth regulations requiring clear labeling of bottled waters. The mini glossary of bottled waters explains what some of the terms used on bottles really mean."

We can infer from the passage that _ .	"""Mark Twain"" was the name used by Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835~1910) when he wrote books.His father was a lawyer,but a poor one,who lived in Florida,Missouri.The family was so poor that Samuel did not receive much teaching.He had to learn all that he could from the people whom he met.His father died when he was very young,and then there was even less money than before. Many of the men in this part of America worked in the ships on the great Mississippi River,and he did this himself at one time (1857). Where did he find the name ""Mark Twain""? It came from the great river itself.It was part of one of the cries used by men who worked in the ships.When a man called ""By the mark twain!"" he meant that the river was ""two marks deep"" there,that is to say,six feet deep ( ""Twain"" is an old form of the word ""Two"".) Samuel Clemens often heard these words when he was young,and he used them as a pen name all his life. During his work on the Mississippi he met travelers of all kinds,and this helped him a great deal when he started to write.But the number of travelers became smaller when war started in America in 1861.Many of the great ships on the river stopped work.Samuel left then and went to Nevada with his brother,who was at that time Governor of Nevada.There,near the town of Carson,Samuel became a gold miner,but he never made much money at the time.He soon saw that life in the gold mines was not for him.He also tried writing for the newspapers in Nevada,and this seemed more hopeful.He found that he could write. He went to Europe in 1867 and visited France and Italy.In 1870 he married Olivia Langdon,and two years later he was spending nearly all his time writing.Among his books is his own story (1908). He is now always known as Mark Twain,and many people do not even know that his family name was Clemens.He traveled in America and in England,and went to Oxford in 1907.He was one of the great American writers of the time,and could make his readers laugh--a thing which few writers can do.He died in 1910."

Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"One day, I heard an American boy said to a Chinese girl student, ""You speak very good English. "" But the girl answered, "" No, no. My English is very poor. "" The foreigner was quite surprised at the answer. Thinking he had not made himself understood or the girl had not heard him clearly, he said, "" Yes, indeed, you speak very well. "" But the girl still kept saying, ""No. "" In the end, the American boy could not understand and didn't know what to say. What's wrong with the girl's answer? She didn't accept a compliment in the same way as the American people do. She should answer, ""Thank you"" instead of ""No"". She really understood what the American boy had said, but she thought she should be modest. In the west, people will feel proud and confident when they are praised. So if someone says the dishes you have cooked are very delicious, you should say, ""Thank you."" In our country, we think being modest is a virtue and being proud is a bad thing, but in my opinion, being confident does not mean being proud, so sometimes you should be confident instead of being modest. If you are modest and say, ""No, I'm afraid I can't do it well"", while working in a western country, the others may think that you really cannot do it. If you often say, ""No"", you will certainly be _ by others. When asking for a job, if one says something like''Yes,I can certainly do it""instead of ""let me have a try"",he or she will expect to get it. So in the west, you should be brave to show your self-confidence."	['In China, people think being modest is a virtue.']

Which of the following statement does the text support?	"Keeping a busy social life among lots of friends may keep people thinner than spending hours doing some exercises, according to scientists. They say that socialising and meeting with friends help increase levels of brown fat in the body which burns calories to produce heat. Living in an exciting social environment was found to reduce fat in mice's belly by half over four weeks, even if they ate more. US researchers say that social excitement aids weight loss by turning white fat into brown. White fat stores calories and makes us fatter, while brown burns energy to produce heat. Turning white fat into brown is extremely difficult,normally requiring long- term stay in cold conditions or exciting part of the body's nervous system. However, scientists from Ohio State University now think that having a busy social life is an even more effective way of changing white fat into brown. The team came up with their theory by studying the effects of various living environments on mice. Those, who lived alongside a greater number of mice, had more space and toys to excite themselves and then lost far more weight over the course of the study than their ""couch potato"" fellows. Study author, Dr Matthew During, whose team's findings appear in the journal Cell Metabolism, said, ""I'm still amazed at the degree of fat loss that occurs."" Explaining how new technology had threatened face-to-face socialising, he added, ""It's not just a sedentary( )lifestyle and high calorie foods, but an increasing lack of social activities."" Co-author Dr Lei Cao said,""Loneliness is a potential factor for cancer and death; it's equal to cigarette smoking to a certain extent. Social activities are very vital.,,"	['Levels of brown fat can be increased by socialising.']
Meditations manage their daily tasks better because they _ .	"In meditation ,people sit quietly and focus their attention on their breath .As they breathe in and out ,they attend to their feelings .As thoughts go through their minds. They let _ go. Breathe .Let go .Breathe .Let go . According to a recent study at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre,Massachusetts. Three months of training in this kind of meditation causes a market change in how the brain allocates attention. It appears that the ability to let go thoughts that come into mind frees the brain to attend to more rapidly changing things and events in the outside world. Expert mediators are better than other people at catching such fast-changing stimuli( ),like facial expressions. The study provides evidence for changes in the workings of the brain with mental training. People can learn and improve abilities of all sorts with practice, everything from driving to playing the piano. The study has shown that meditation is good for the brain. It appears to reduce pressure and promote a sense of well-being. In an experiment, 17 volunteers with no meditation experience in the experimental group spent three months meditating 10 to 12 hours a day .A control group also with no meditation experience meditated for 20 minutes a day over the same period .Both groups were then given the tests with two numbers in a group of letters. As both group looked for the numbers , their brain activity was recorded. Everyone could catch the first number .But the brain recordings showed that the less experienced mediators tended to grasp the first number and hang onto it, so they missed the second number .Those with more experience gave less attention to the first number .as if letting it go ,which led to an increased ability to grasp the second number ,This shows that attention can change with practice. Just ask Daniel Levision , who meditated for three months as part of the study .""I am a much better listener,"" he said . "" I do not get lost in my own personal reaction to what people are saying."""	['have more stimuli for life']
Neither of the two mice ran away immediately because _ .	"One day when some government officials were building a barn , they found a mouse hole in a corner and used smoke to make the mice inside the hole come out. A while later they indeed saw mice running out, one after another. Then, everyone thought that all the mice had escaped. But just as they began to clean up, they saw two mice squeezing out at the mouth of the hole. With some efforts, the mice finally got out. However, it was strange that after they came out of the hole, they didn't run away immediately. Instead, one chased after the other near the mouth of the hole. It seemed that one was trying to bite the tail of the other. Everyone was puzzled , so they stepped near to take a look. They realized that one of the mice was blind and couldn't see anything, and the other was trying to allow the blind mouse to bite on his tail so that he could pull the blind one with him to escape. After seeing what happened, everyone was speechless and lost in thought. During the meal time, the group of people sat down in a circle and started to chat about what happened to the two mice. One serious American official said, ""I think the relationship between those mice was that of king and guard ."" The other thought for a while and said, ""That is why!"" A smart Frenchman said, ""I think the relationship between those two mice was that of husband and wife."" Again the others thought for a while, and all felt it made sense. A Japanese said, ""I think the relationship between those two mice was that of mother and son."" Once again the others thought for a while, and felt this was more reasonable. So they expressed agreement another time. At that moment, one Chinese asked, ""Why did those two mice have to have a certain relationship?"" Suddenly, the group looked back at the Chinese and stayed speechless. The American official, the French and the Japanese who had spoken earlier all lowered their heads in shame , and did not dare to answer. In fact, the true love is not built on friendship, loyalty or blood relationship. Instead, it is based on no relationship."	['one was trying to help the blind one']

People have always wondered how the 36-year-old Canadian can be so skillful in the Chinese language even though it is considered by many as one of the most difficult languages in the world. But to Dashan, the great challenge was _ due to his deep interest, proper method and the excellent environment he created for himself. ""Interest is the best teacher."" That is a universal principle. Even if he hadn't fully realized what attracted him to the Chinese department at the University of Toronto inCanada, he was already deeply interested in Chinese culture when he decided to have further study inBeijing. Entering the Chinese department ofPekingUniversityin 1988, Dashan felt like a duck in water. Study is always a hard job, no matter how much interest you have. Therefore, effective ways are necessary to improvement. "" _ "" is Dashan's belief. As a freshman at theUniversityofToronto, the student did study the textbooks. They did help him build a solid foundation. However, that's far from enough to grasp the Chinese language. Starting in his junior year, Dashan began to read original Chinese novels, Chinese newspapers and even the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. ""Only the material for Chinese native readers could give me a proper sense of the language,"" he said. That the language is the daily means of communication is the principle that Dashan always keeps in his mind. What you have really learned depends on what you can use, not necessarily your mastery of textbooks. To learn in daily life requires a favourable language environment, which is also necessary for improvement. Dashan admits it is hard for Chinese English learners to be brought into a good English speaking environment, but he insists, ""To listen and speak as much as possible does help."""

Which of the following statements is the author's opinion? _ .	"How to improve my life? Many people think that they have to accept whatever life throws at them. They'll say, ""This is my fate, my destiny. I cannot change it."" Of course not! You don't have to suffer needlessly. Your destiny depends on you, not on any other external factors. I know someone who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows. Huh! Is this what she calls ""doing her best""? She believes she has tried her best and just accepts it in her heart that this is the life that God has intended for her to live; that her luck can only change if God wills it. Of course God wants us to be happy and live our life to the fullest, but we have to do our share of exerting the effort to live the life of our dreams. Remember that you reap what you sow. You just don't sit around and wait for a million dollars to fall from the sky. You have to get off the couch, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone. Don't expect your luck to change unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a temporary setback; but use it as feedback. Learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively; you also have to act positively. If someone's life is in the trouble, do you just hope and pray that things will turn out fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best. In other words, don't just stand (or sit ) there, do something to improve your life."	['Your luck can be changed by your efforts']
Which of the following is NOT a reason for the author's renting an iPad instead of buying one?	"Because I am extremely vulnerable to both slick advertising and peer pressure, I've been thinking about getting an iPad. But here's the problem: I'm cheap, and the iPad's not. If I'm going to fork over at least $499 for a new device, I want to try it out and make sure it's not just a larger, shinier version of my iPhone. But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for $15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods. The Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land). But regardless of whether the sharing is free or involves a fee, these transactions often come with a stick-it-to-the-man attitude. ""Borrow these things from your neighbors,"" reads one earnest request on neighborrow.com, ""The owner-ship has SAILED!"" All of these sites are encouraging something academics call collaborative consumption - in other words, peer-to-peer sharing or renting. Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social. In an era when families are scattered around the country and we may not know the people down the street from us, sharing things - even with strangers we've just met online - allows us to make meaningful connections. ""This isn't just about saving the environment or saving a dollar,"" says SnapGoods CEO Ron Williams, who came up with the idea after renting a stranger's motorcycle via Craigslist. ""This is about saving yourself by making informed consumer decisions."" I'm not sure if I got a thrill when I borrowed Goodwin's iPad, but it did feel good to make a connection. In the end, though, I decided not to purchase an iPad. Sorry, Steve Jobs. I'm just not that into owning things anymore."	['The iPad is so expensive that he cannot afford it.']
Which of the following is TRUE about GM foods?	"The world has a fast growing population and people need more land for houses, factories, highways, and so on. The farmland is decreasing with each passing day. How to meet the need of feeding the growing population? One way is to introduce some high-output gene into a crop to enable it to produce more. Biologists over the years have discovered genes which can raise output of the crops, resist pests, improve taste, etc. However, in many western countries there is widespread concern over the safety of""Genetically Modified""(GM) foods, because they think there may be serious problems of environment, health, safety, morality and so on. As a scientist I must admit GM foods involve great risks to humans. In fact in Europe they're called ""Frankenstein foods"" by many. Frankenstein is a character in a novel. He was a very clever scientist. He created a monster , which eventually killed him. Soybeans can be made into many foods. However, it's hard to _ . Therefore, it's very important we have to make sure the soybean, if genetically modified, is free from any poisonous matter harmful to human beings. For this we need very good testing. We do have some testing on some animals, but no completely satisfactory testing has ever been made so far. They're entirely new, and their problems are entirely unknown. It takes time to develop persuasive tests to know whether they're harmful to us or not. We may not be able to tell what may happen if we take GM foods. Some of them may be resistant to antibiotics . Then many of the medicines we have today will have no effect on people eating GM foods. A more likely case is the GM foods may contain genes some people are allergic to. GM products have already come into our lives but most people even know nothing about it. At least we have to be clear about what we are eating. The China Consumers Association is calling for labeling on GM foods so that consumers will know before they buy them."	['Sometimes consumers can hardly tell GM soybeans from natural ones.']
The author tries to persuade the readers to accept his arguments mainly by _ .	"Who's in control of your life? Who is pulling your string? For the majority of us, it's other people - society, colleagues, friends, family or our religious community. We learned this way of operating when we were very young, of course.We were brainwashed.We discovered that feeling important and feeling accepted was a nice experience and so we learned to do everything we could to make other people like us.As Oscar Wilde puts it,""Most people are other people.Their thoughts are someone else's opinions,their lives a mimicry ,their passions a quotation."" So when people tell us how wonderful we are,it makes us feel good.We long for this good feeling like a drug--we are addicted to it and seek it out wherever we can.Therefore,we are so eager for the approval of others that we live unhappy and limited lives,failing to do the things we really want to.Just as drug addicts and alcoholics live worsened lives to keep getting their fix ,we worsen our own existence to get our own constant fix of approval. But just as with any drug,there is a price to pay.The price of the approval drug is freedom--the freedom to be ourselves. The truth is that we cannot control what other people think.People have their own schedule,and they come with their own baggage and,in the end,they're more interested in themselves than in you.Furthermore,if we try to live by the opinions of others,we will build our life on sinking sand.Everyone has a different way of thinking,and people change their opinions all the time.The person who tries to please everyone will only end up getting exhausted and probably pleasing no one in the process. So how can we take back control? I think there's only one way--make a conscious decision to stop caring what other people think.We should guide ourselves by means of a set of values--not values imposed from the outside by others,but inborn values which come from within.If we are driven by these values and not by the changing opinions and value systems of others,we will live a more authentic,effective,purposeful and happy life."

From the data of the survey, we learn _ .	"Most parents of kids under age 8 don't worry about how much time they spend watching TV or using other media, from computers to smart phones to tablets PCs, according to a new survey that found a child's use of media often reflects how much time parents spend in the similar way. We generally found that media use is not a source of conflict in the home"" for families with young children, Ellen Wartella, a researcher from Northwestem University, told USA Today. She led a survey of 2,326 parents who have children 8 and younger.It found that in 80 percent of families, children's media use was not a problem, with 55 percent ""not too"" or"" not at all"" concerned about it. It also showed parents have more positive than negative feelings about how media consumption affects a child's learning and the development of creativity.The exception is video games, which are viewed more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices.""Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's school performance, attention time, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium,"" the researchers said in a news conference about the survey. The findings exposes a generational shift in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,"" said Wartella.""Today's parents grew up with technology as a central pact of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents, instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair. "" The researchers identified three media environments created by parents: media-centric (39 percent of families) , media-moderate (45%)and media-light (16%). Children in media-centric families spend at least three hours more each day watching TV or using computers, video games and tablet PCs don't make parenting easier.And 88 percent of parents say they are most likely to turn to toys or activities to keep their children occupied.Slightly fewer turn to books (79%) and TV(78%). The survey didn't look at how media affects children. That's a topic that the American Academy of Pediatrics has handled a number of times. The AAP says studies have found too much media use can lead to attention- problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders and being fat. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illegal and risky behaviors. By limiting screen time and offering educational media and non-electronic formats such as books, newspapers and board games, and watching television with their children, parents can help guide their children's media experience. Putting questionable content into context and teaching kids a700ut advertising contributes to their media literacy ,"" it says. The pediatricians' group says parents should have ""screen-free zones"" and TV should be turned off during dinner. At most, it recommends children and teens engage with entertainment media for no more than two hours a day and that should be high-quality content. It is important for kids to spend time on outdoor play, reading, hobbies and using their imaginations in free play."" Kids under 2 should not use television and other entertainment media because their brains are developing quickly and they learn best from direct human interaction,"" the group says. An article on screen time by t.he Mayo Clinic also notes problems linked t.o over screen time, including being fat, irregular sleep , behavioral problems , weak school performance , violence and less time for active and creative play."

"Why do almost all parents dislike the term ""summer school""?"	"Each new school year brings fresh reminders of what educators call the summer learning gap. Some call it the summer learning setback. Put simply, it means the longer kids are out of school, the more they forget. The only thing they seem to gain is weight. Most American schools follow a traditional nine-month calendar with winter and spring breaks and about ten weeks of summer vacation. Some schools follow a year-round calendar. They hold classes for about eight weeks at a time, with a few weeks off in between. The National Association for Year-Round Education says there were fewer than 3,000 such schools at last count. They were spread among forty-six of the fifty states. But many experts point out that the number of class days in a year round school is generally the same as in a traditional school. Brenda McLaughlin is a research director at the National Centre for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University. She says studies of year-round schooling have not found strong learning gains. Lead researcher Paul von Hippel said, ""Year round schools don't really solve the problem of the summer learning setback. They simply spread it out across the year."" Across the country, research shows that students from poor families fall farther behind over the summer than other students. Experts say this can be prevented. They note that many schools and local governments offer programmes that can help. However, calling such programmes ""summer school"" could be a problem. The director of the summer learning centre at Johns Hopkins, Ikon Fairchild, said research with groups of different parents in Chicago and Baltimore found that almost all strongly disliked the term ""summer school"". In American culture, the idea of summer vacation is connected to beliefs about freedom and the joys of childhood. The parents preferred other terms like ""summer camp, ""extra time"" and ""hands-on learning."	"[""They cherish the children's rights and freedom.""]"
The true statement is that _ .	"New research is strengthening evidence that eating vegetables may be some of the best health advice. A study of 500, 000 Americans has found that just one extra serving of fruit or vegetables a day may reduce the risk of developing head and neck cancer. Many studies have shown that diet plays a role in cancer. Cancer experts now believe that up to two-thirds of all cancers come from lifestyle such as smoking, diet and lack of exercise. Tobacco and alcohol use increases the risk of head and neck cancer, which affects the mouth, nose, sinuses and throat. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute asked men and women aged 50 and older about their diets, then followed them for five years to record all diagnoses of head and neck cancer, the sixth-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The study found eating six servings of fruit and vegetables per day per 1, 000 calories cut the risk of head and neck cancer by 29 percent compared to eating one and a half servings. An adult needs around 2, 000 calories a day. ""One more serving of fruit or vegetables per 1, 000 calories per day reduced head and neck cancer risk by 6 percent,""said Neal Freedman, a cancer prevention fellow at the NCI. A second study in 183, 000 people of California and Hawaii found a diet high in flavonols might help reduce pancreatic cancer risk, especially in smokers. Flavonols are common in plants but highest in onions, apples, berries, kale and broccoli. The study found that people who ate the most flavonols reduced risk of developing pancreatic cancer by 23 percent than those who ate the least."	['having more vegetables means no cancers']

How many types of word games are mentioned in the passage?	"About 15 years ago, readers of The Independent, a daily national newspaper, were asked by its travel journalists what they missed when they were away from home, and what they looked forward to when they returned. Apart from ""family"", ""friends"" and ""favorite foods"", many people mentioned ""the Sunday newspapers"" and ""the crossword puzzle"". It's certainly true that among their many hobbies, the English enjoy words, above all reading them and playing with them. Reading books is one of the most popular relaxation activities, with approximately 100,000 books a year published. Over 80 per cent of the population regularly read a daily newspaper, and there are more newspapers per person than any other country except Japan. The weekend newspapers generally contain hundreds of pages, and even the most popular hobbies -- fishing, stamp collecting, train-spotting, bird-watching, walking, sports, pets, flower-arranging, knitting and pigeon-fancying -- have at least _ , if not several specialist magazines, devoted to them. In fact, many people probably spend more time reading about their hobbies than actually doing them. It's also undoubtedly true that word games, puzzles and competitions are hugely popular in newspapers, on the radio and even on television. One of the most popular television games in the 1980s and 1990s was ""Call My Bluff"" where two teams of players had to guess which of three meanings of an unfamiliar word was correct. In many cases newspapers have a word games section, such as a ""Words within Words"" competition where the aim is to make as many words as possible with the letters of a single word. Above all, crossword puzzles are the most familiar word game, with clues ranging from words which have the same meaning as other words, to the ""Cryptic"" where the meaning of the word is expressed in a very indirect way, and in a variety of linguistic and cultural references. Apparently, some people choose their newspaper not because of the quality of the news coverage but because of the crossword puzzle. You may think that you would need an excellent command of the English language to enjoy playing with words as much as the English do. But many of the word games are very simple and good fun, and in fact, the only skill you must have is to speak and listen or read and write a little."	['3']
Which of the following reasons for anxiety is not mentioned in the passage?	Are you stressed out, scared or worried all the time? Do you avoid going to certain places, seeing friends or doing certain things because of your worries? Do your worries keep you awake at night? If you've answered yes, you may be suffering from anxiety. Anxiety is a normal and necessary part of life. Anxiety is your brain's way of telling you about danger. It is anxiety which helps you jump out of the way if a car is speeding towards you. But if it gets out of hand, anxiety can get in the way of you getting on with life and can become a real problem. If this is the case for you, treatment may be a helpful way for you to get your anxiety under control. Anxiety is a normal part of life. Some people may feel uneasy if moving to a new place and some may get overly anxious in certain situations. There are lots of reasons for this. One main reason is after a stressful thing which has happened in your life. So, if you are involved in a car crash, it's quite likely that you will be more worried than other people around cars and driving. Being anxious also probably runs in families. If your parents suffer from anxiety then you are more likely to be anxious too. This is probably partly due to genetics, and partly because of how things are when you're growing up. Even though people don't talk about it much, anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems. About 1 in 4 people will have an anxiety problem at some time in their life. If you have an anxiety problem it's hard for other people to understand why something that doesn't worry them, like being in a crowd of people, can be so scary for you. This can make you feel separated and lonely, as may become worse and worse. The good news is there are lots of excellent treatments available for anxiety. These include talking therapies and drugs.

What happened to Gibb in the 1966 Boston Marathon?	"In 490 B.C. the Greek messenger, Pheidippides , ran about 40 kilometers from the town of ""Marathon""to Athens to announce the victory of Athens over Macedon . Since then ,the 42-kilometer ""Marathon""race has become a great test for athletes. However, for many years , only men were allowed to run this race , because the distance was said to be unbearable for women. In 1966, an American women named Roberta Gibb proved that idea wrong. Gibb had always enjoyed running .One day in 1964 , she saw the Boston Marathon happening as she was running in the woods. Since running meant a lot to her, she began training harder , hoping to join the marathon some day. Gibb finally applied to run in the 1966 Boston Marathon, but she was not given entrance because the Boston Marathon Association considered that women were not strong enough to run 42 kilometers . Yet, this was no obstacle to Gibb, for she knew she had the physical and mental strength to complete the race .On the day the 1966 Boston Marathon was held , Gibb hid in the bushes and jumped into the race when it began. She finished the race in 3 hours and 21 minutes, defeating two thirds of the men in the race and proving that women could run the marathon. Although what Gibb did was only to realize her dream, in doing so she showed the world that women could accomplish greater things than many people believed they could."

In the passage, the writer intends to tell us that _ .	"When I met him, I had a lot of anger inside me.

I could have ended up that way, too, but Mr. Clark wouldn't let that happen. Mr. Clark worked long hours, making sure I did my work. My grades rose. In fact, the scores of our whole class rose. One day, he took our class to see The Phantom of the Opera, and it was the first time some kids had ever been out of Harlem. Before the show, he treated us to dinner at a restaurant and taught us not to talk with our mouths full. We did not want to let him down. Mr. Clark was selected as Disney's 2000 Teacher of the Year. He said he would draw three names out of a hat ; those students would go with him to Los Angles to get the award. But when the time came to draw names, Mr. Clark said, ""You're all going."" On graduation day, there were a lot of tears. We didn't want his class to end. In 2001, he moved to Atlanta, but he always kept in touch. He started giving lectures about education, and wrote a best-selling book based on his classroom rules, The Essential 55. In 2003, Mr. Clark took some of us on a trip to South Africa to deliver school supplies and visit orphanages . It was the most amazing experience of my life.

In the author's opinion, the construction of a theatre will _ .	"Letter to the Editor A heated debate is currently going on in our town. Should we allow the cinema to be constructed in the Havenswood Shopping Center? There is just one large area left to build on, and the theater would use up all of that space. Some people are excited at the idea of finally having our own movie theater. Others would rather travel ten miles to the nearest theater to keep our quiet town the way it is. They say it is enough to have Marvin's Movie Video Rentals. After all, Marvin's store keeps thousands of the latest videos. There are certainly benefits to renting videos. For one thing, you can plan your own schedule when it is convenient for you. You can relax on your sofa, and take a break whenever you need one. You can also talk to others without bothering any strangers seated nearby. In addition, it is a less expensive way to view a movie, especially if more than one person is watching the video. On the other hand, seeing a movie in a theater is an experience all its own. First, you can see the movie on a wide screen as the filmmaker intended. To be viewed on a television screen, a film must be changed in some way to make it smaller. One is the ""pan-and-scan method, which involves removing some of the details in the picture. The other way, called ""letterboxing, keeps the image the way it is on the big screen, with one annoying exception; because the big-screen style is wide, the same picture on a television screen must be long and narrow. Another problem is sound. The sound from a television cannot compare with the sound system in a theater. Your experience of a movie improves when you can clearly hear all of the sounds. Furthermore, at home, viewing companions often talk during a movie, which makes you miss out on what's happening in the film. Besides, having a movie theater will not mean that you can't still go to Marvin's! You will just have a choice that you didn't have before. Isn't it time for Havenswood residents like me to enjoy a little progress?"	['offer people another experience']
_ not only can save energy but also can do some exercise.	"""Green"" is more than just a color. It also means taking special steps to protect the environment--the water, the land, and the air we breathe. Why green? Plants are green, and without them the earth wouldn't be such a lovely home for us human beings. Every day, people make choices that affect the amount of trash and pollution that gets produced in our world. What can you do? A whole lot, actually. Here's a four-step guide to being green: Reduce the amount of stuff you use and throw away. Reuse stuff when you can. Recycle cans, bottles, paper, books, and even toys, Sometimes water can be. For instance, some communities take used water - like from the washing machine and shower - and clean it up so it's safe to use for watering the grass and flowers. Enjoy the Earth - walk in the woods, plant a tree, and eat some of the delicious food it produces. Here's a list of other stuff you can reduce: Close the switches when you're not using lights. Turn off the water when you're brushing your teeth.. When you can, walk or ride your bike instead of driving in the car. You'll use less gas - and get some exercise! Turn off for your phone and MP3 player when you're not using them. Put your computer to ""sleep"" instead of leaving it on with the screensaver running."	['Walking to work']

Once, at his 70th birthday party, a friend asked Freud if he could put his work into several words.""Well,""said Freud, ""we take the sick out of their trouble and return them to the common suffering."" As a devoted son, Freud often visited his old mother. His mother usually spent her summer in a small mountain town in Austria. The King Josef usually spent his summer there, too.

What is the writer's attitude towards parents' renaming their children?	"A new semester has just started and a number of parents are registering to change their children's names, in the hope that it will change their temper or help their children drop bad habits, like addiction to the Internet. One mother surnamed Shi renamed her son, a primary school student, Hengfu, which means eternal happiness in Chinese. She decided to change the boy's name because he always did poorly in study. She has had him tutored after school, but he always earns low marks in school. So Shi turned to a name-giving master. ""I hope the special recipe could bring him good luck,"" the mother said. Teachers in the city say a few students in every school, most nearing graduation, change their names at the start of every new semester. A naming agency said it has found names for nearly 1,000 students since setting up the shop in 1998. The store said its professionals analyzed the defects of a person's original name, and suggested a new one based on the person's birthday and other fortune-telling skills. Buying a new name costs between 800 yuan and 10,000 yuan. Parents also have to register the name at the local police department for a small fee. This will legally change their child's name on all documents, including ID cards and passports. Hu Jie, a university student who changed her name in her final year of high school, said the new name confused her. ""I always had no idea who my classmates were calling when they used my new name,"" Hu said, adding that she wished she had kept her old name. But parents may be ignoring one thing: name changes might encourage kids to believe that fate is more important than their own efforts."	['Negative.']
What does the writer mainly discuss in the passage?	"The popularity of farmers' markets combined with concerns over food security is making the number of school leavers taking agriculture courses increase rapidly, according to a study. Large numbers of 16- to 18-year-olds are going to study subjects such as agriculture, food and gamekeeping despite having no background in farming. Jeanette Dawson, principal of Bishop Burton College, said women were also taking up courses at an increasing rate. She said it was related to a series of food scandals such as the discovery of horsemeat in frozen meals stocked by major supermarkets. But the movement was also promoted by an increased awareness of the importance of local food and produce, she said. The number of students taking courses in ""land-based subjects"" has increased by a quarter in the last 12 months alone - from 5,138 to 6,482. Mrs. Dawson said there were a lot of young people who weren't from farming backgrounds. But there had been a growth in the number of them accessing agriculture programes with a view to a career in the industry. She said agriculture was an ""applied science, with the great outdoors as its laboratory"". And it was increasingly seen as an attractive job for school leavers. ""I never underestimate the ability of teenagers to pick up on it. The more it is in the media, the more it interests young people. Whenever I go in my local pub, it has on the blackboard where the sausages are from. Everyone is interested in buying local food and knowing where their food is from. The comments were made as Bishop Burton prepares to expand, with a PSI3 million project to build a new campus in Lincolnshire. The site - due to open in September 20l5 - will be the college's second in the county, in addition to one at nearby Riseholme."	['Why agriculture courses are becoming popular among students.']
More young people drop out of college because _ .	"There is no denying that over the years college education has been accepted without the slightest doubt. All high school graduates should go, says conventional wisdom and statistical evidence, because college will help them earn more, become ""better"" citizens and be more responsible than those who don't go. But college can never work its magic for everyone. Now with half our high school graduates attending college, those unfit for the pattern are getting more. College graduates are selling shoes and driving taxis; college students interfere with each other's experiments and write false letters of recommendation in the fierce competition for admission into graduate schools. Others find no stimulation in their studies, and consequently have to drop out, which is often encouraged by college administrators. Some observers say the fault lies with young people themselves --- they are spoiled and expecting too much. But that's a condemnation of the students as a whole, and doesn't explain all campus unhappiness. Others blame our society. Both are partly right. We have been told that young people have to go to college because our economy can't absorb an army of untrained eighteen-year-olds. But disappointed graduates are learning that it can no longer absorb an army of trained twenty-two-year-olds, either. Some campus watchers suggest that college may not be the best, the proper or the only place for every young person after finishing high school. It seems that through the rosy glow of our own college experiences, we may have been looking at those surveys and statistics upside down. Perhaps college does not make people intelligent, ambitious, happy, or quick to learn things--maybe _ . Intelligent, ambitious, happy, quick-learning people are merely those who are attracted to college in the first place. And perhaps all those successful college graduates would have been successful even without college education. This is heresy to those who have been brought up to believe that if a little schooling is good, more has to be much better. But contrary evidence is beginning to pile up."

Where did Bill and Sam play?	One Saturday morning Ann was going on business. Before starting, she took her son Sam to her friends, Bill and Kate, and asked them to look after him for the day. Sam, an independent boy of six years old, had black hair and was wearing a pair of jeans and a bright yellow shirt. At eleven o'clock Bill took Sam into town. Sam walked along behind Bill, looking at the windows of all the shops they passed. After lunch they went to the park and walked about. The whole place was very crowded. Bill stopped to buy some chocolate. When he turned round to give some to Sam, the boy wasn't there. Bill ran round calling Sam, but he couldn't find him. About an hour later, just in front of a shop, he saw the black hair, the pair of jeans and the bright yellow shirt. The boy looked as if he was waiting for someone to come out of the shop. Bill ran across the road, took the boy by the hand and hurried off, as it was quite late. The boy began to cry and pull hard, but Bill, who didn't know much about children, couldn't understand a word the boy was saying. All the boy made was a lot of noise. When they got home at last, Bill went straight to the kitchen, with the boy still crying. At the door Bill stopped with an amazed look. There, sitting at the kitchen table with Kate, was a small boy with black hair, in a pair of jeans and a bright yellow shirt.	['In a park.']
According to the passage, the first and most important thing to be other people's friend is _ .	Friendships can be difficult -- because often people aren't as honest and open as they should be. Sometimes, people finally get hurt. Most problems with friendships come up because people are just too selfish to care about the things that their friends need. They care about their own needs much more, which makes it hard for friendships to work. However, being selfish is part of human nature. A person is put together in order to take care of themselves and their own needs, not necessarily those needs of other people. Even though being selfish is something that all humans are born with, it is something that everyone should be against. The best thing to remember when you are a friend to anyone is that you need to treat your friends the same way that you'd like to be treated . This is wonderful advice for a friendship, because it is really the only way to make sure that you are giving your friends everything you would want to be given in a friendship. Whenever you have a question about how you should treat a friend, it is easy to find an answer simply by asking yourself what you would like your friend to do for you, if he or she was in your shoes. Even if you're always thinking about how you'd like to be treated, and your friends are too, there are problems that come up from time to time in each friendship, and it is important to understand how to deal with these problems so that you can build stronger and healthier friendships. Problems like friends getting boyfriends or girlfriends and not spending enough time with their friends, or even friends finding new friends and leaving old friends behind are problems that will probably come up with one or more of your friendships. It is important to know how to deal with these friend problems so that you can keep your friends and make new ones. No one wants to have a broken friendship.	['to treat your friend as you like to be']
From this passage, we can infer that _ .	"""Any time! Any where! Decades ago there was no such thing"" - ""Communication"". Then, September 7th 1987, the global system for mobile communication or GSM was born. And international agreements that laid out the standards, regulations and practices gave rise to a global mobile phone industry. To be honest, the world's first mobiles were not so attractive and the range of effectiveness wasn't very good. But they became a must-have among those wealthy people who could afford that. However, by advantage of GSM which has many different elements to it, we can all enjoy the ability to go around the world in 217 countries, land in that country and know that a phone would work. There are other cell phone systems using different technology in the world. The majority of the United States and parts of South America have been using something called CDMA which is very rare in Europe. In some Asian countries like China, GSM and CDMA both exist at the same time. But the GSM Association claims 85% of the global mobile phone market. They estimated there are now about 2.5 billion different users who make more than 7 trillion minutes of calls everyday, and that's not all. 20 years later, the mobile phone is so much more than just a phone. You can use it to send text messages, take pictures, show video, even surf the internet. ""The phone itself is involved from just being a communication tool, to be a tool for round-the-clock connectivity, you can not live without it even in a minute."" Mobile consultant Nick Lane also points out with so many customized styles and features, your mobile phone will become a symbol of you. Where will the global mobile phone industry be in another 20 years? Certainly, there will be more connections than better coverage. As for where else technology will take us, one can only imagine."	['most of the mobile phone users in the world now are using the GSM mobile phone']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"Helen Thomas, born on August 4, 1920, is a famous news reporter, a Hearst Newspapers columnist, and member of the White House Press Corps. She served for fifty-seven years as a correspondent and White House bureau chief for United Press International (UPI). She is called ""First Lady of the Press"". Born in Kentucky, Helen Thomas was raised in Detroit, Michigan where she attended public schools and later graduated from Wayne State University. Upon leaving college, Helen served as a copy girl in an old company in Washington. In 1943, Ms. Thomas joined United Press International and the Washington Press Corps. Thomas served as president of the Women's National Press Club from 1959 to 1960. In November, Helen began covering then President-elect John F. Kennedy, following him to the White House in January 1961 as a UPI correspondent. She later became White House Bureau Chief for UPI, where she was employed until her resignation on May 17, 2000. Thomas then became a White House correspondent and columnist. Thomas was the only woman journalist traveling with then President Nixon to China in January, 1972. She has traveled around the world several times with Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, during the course of which she covered every Economic Summit.The World Almanachas cited her as one of the 25 Most Influential Women in America.

The most important character of this kind of bike is its _ .	"Zipped into a bag, it looks like a large umbrella. Unfolded, it goes along the street like any other bicycle. It's the ""A-bike"", the brainchild of British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, who made history in the 1970s by developing the world's first pocket calculator. He described his new invention as ""the world's smallest, lightest foldable bicycle"". ""My original thought was that if you could have a bicycle that was dramatically lighter and more firm than the ones that exist today, it would change the way in which bicycles are used,""said Sinclair. The mini-bike, showed in Singapore last week and set to go on sale worldwide in 2005 at a price of nearly US$300, is built for riders as heavy as 112 kilograms and is height-adjustable . It takes about 20 seconds to fold or unfold. Its wheels are a quarter the size of those on a regular bicycle, but Sinclair promises a smooth ride for most cyclists. ""You require no extra energy to ride the A-bike and it can go up to 15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour),"" he said. Constructed mainly of plastic, the 5.5-kilogram bicycle folds into a package of less than 0.03 cubic meters . Sinclair also invented the first pocket TV in 1984 and the futuristic C5 electric tricycle in 1985. He said he hoped the bicycle would attract common citizens, officials, campers or anyone needing transport for a short trip and he said the next step for the A-bike was to add an electric motor in a few years."

Children can study better and easily on TV because _ .]	Most children like watching TV. It's very interesting. By watching TV they can see and learn a lot and know many things about their country and the world. Of course, they can also learn over the radio. But they can learn better and more easily on TV. Why? Because they can hear and watch at the same time. But they can't see anything over the radio. TV helps to open children's eyes. It helps to open their minds , too. They learn newer and better ways of doing things. Many children watch TV only on Saturday or Sunday evening. They are always busy with their classes. But a few children watch TV every night. They go to bed very late. They can't have a good rest. How about you, my young friends?	['they can hear and watch at the same time']
In the accident, the baby _ .	"The TV shows a baby's pram rolling off a train platform as the mother makes a mad rush to save her son, but she is too late and it falls onto the rails in front of an incoming train. This heart-stopping scene happened yesterday at Ashburton station in Melbourne, Australia. But the story has a happy ending: the six-month-old baby survived with just a cut on his forehead, although the pram was dragged about 35 metres by the braking train. The nurse Jon Wright said the boy just ""needed a feed and a sleep"" and didn't need to stay in hospital. ""Luckily, he was strapped into his pram at the time, which probably saved his life. I think the child is extremely lucky, "" Wright told theHerald Sunnewspaper after the baby was taken to hospital with minor injuries. Fortunately the train was already slowing down to stop at the station so it stopped quickly when the driver put on the brakes as soon as he saw the pram fall in front of him. Rail firm Connex is to look into how the pram rolled off the platform. The accident came one day after Connex started a child safety awareness activity warning parents to keep babies strapped into their prams at all times while on platforms. The accident happened at the same time as the ""balloon boy ""story in the US, in which a six-year-old Colorado boy was reported to be trapped in a flyaway balloon. However, he was later found hiding in the family's garage. Many people believe that it had all been a publicity _ by the parents. No such doubts surround the baby on the train platform."

According to the Bible, _	"The term ""to extend an olive branch"" means to make an offer of peace or reconciliation . This term has Biblical origins, coming from the section of the Old Testament that deals with the flood; the sign that the flood is over is an olive branch brought back to the ark by a dove. Olive branches were also symbols of peace in Ancient Greece and Rome, and they continue to be used in various works of art that are meant to suggest peace. Some people have suggested that the olive was a very deliberate and well-considered choice as a metaphor for peace, because olive trees famously take years to mature. War is typically very, hard on the trees because people cannot take the time to nurture them and plant new ones. Therefore, the offer of an olive branch would suggest that someone is tired of war, whether it be an actual war or a falling out between friends. In Ancient Greek and Roman times, people would offer actual olive branches. In Rome, for example, defeated armies traditionally carried olive branches to indicate that they were giving in, and the Greeks used them into weddings and other ceremonies. In the modem era, the branch is usually metaphorical, rather than actual, not least because the plants can be a bit difficult to obtain. Many people agree that peace negotiations at all levels of society are a good idea. Between nations, obviously, it is important to extend an olive branch to ensure mutual safety and to help the world run more smoothly. This act can also be important on a personal level, as resolving conflict and learning to get along with others is viewed as an important life skill in many cultures. At some point m their lives, many people will be advised to extend an olive branch to settle a dispute or resolve an issue. Some people believe that it takes an immense amount of courage to take this action, as it often comes with an admission of wrongdoing and regret."	['an olive branch means flood is over']
What idea does the writer of the passage support?	"While many young people may resist getting a ""real job"" or becoming independent, these are the things that make you happy and give you purpose. Some people underestimate the satisfaction of working, thinking they'll be miserable. The 20-somethings that do work are happier than those who don' t or are underemployed. If you invest in your career early,you'll have longer to build it up. 70% of wage growth happens in the first 10 years, so you need to get the best job you can get and negotiate your salary. No one can be sure that people who will wait until their 30s to get going are expecting to experience later to catch up with those of their ages. Many 20-somethings don't know what they want to do, so they hang around the house or in. low-level jobs waiting for the spirit to move them. Not making a choice is a choice. These 20-somethings think they are keeping their options open, but they are actually closing doors. Resumes start to look thin, their peers begin surpassing them and they may get stuck in underemployment. It will take about 10,000 hours(or about five years)to really master their jobs. If you're wondering why colleagues seem so smart and confident, it's partly because they've been doing it longer. Young people should learn as much as they can in their first jobs and remember it will take some time to really get good. The 20-something brain is still developing, which is in charge of critical emotion with reason. This, _ less on-the-job experience, means 20-somethings are more sensitive to surprise and criticism. They are more likely to take feedback personally. Step back and get some perspective. You're not going to be fired because your boss is angry. Hear the criticism and learn from it. The brain doesn't fully mature until your mid-20s, particularly the parts that plan for the future and manage emotions. That doesn't mean you should sit around and wait for it to develop. In. fact, what you learn and experience in your 20s becomes hardwired into your brain and this is the best chance you have to change your brain and change how you think and react. What people do in their 20s determines who they'll be as adults."	['A lesson should be learned from criticism.']

Which word can best describe the writer's attitude towards eating together with families?	When was the last time your family sat down together to have a dinner? The speed at which we live today no longer allows for slow eating habits. Most people work long hours. There is lots of fast food and eating out is now on the increase. Often, food is eaten in front of the television in silence, or a child eats alone in front of the computer. When I was a child, every evening around the same time, one of the children would be asked to set the table, and then we'd go and wash our hands: before the meal. This was the time of day when we would talk about our day at school. But now things have changed a lot. A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food. Parents' likes and dislikes of a certain food will also influence a child's own likes and dislikes. Studies have shown that children who often eat with their families have better results at school than children who eat with their families less than twice a week. Regular meal times give children the chance to discuss their problems with family members. They can also learn to respect others around the table. Talking to your children over dinner is the best way of having their-trust. Children learn good eating habits from their parents at a very young age. Family meals are important. Prepare them for your children.	['Supportive.']
Which of the following best illustrates a child's originality?	Children are often far more gifted than what their parents or teachers can realize.IQ tests do not measure creative talents.By depending on them to measure intelligence,therefore,we miss out on the talents of many of our most gifted youngsters.Most children start life with valuable creative potential.Unfortunately,many of them have it knocked out of them,so to speak,by the time they reach the 4th grade.It is not that parents and teachers deliberately squelch creativity;or rather,they fail to recognize it.By simply observing the child at work or at play,you may detect creativity,if you look for the following key signs: *Curiosity.The child's questioning is persistent and purposeful.He is not content with given explanations,and he would rather dig under the surface. *Flexibility.If one approach doesn't work,the child quickly thinks of another. *Sensitivity to Problem.He is quick to see gaps in information.He is sensitive to contradictions between prior rules and what he hears or reads. *Selffeeling.He has a feeling of being somebody in particular.He is selfmotivated,selfdirected,and can work alone for long periods provided it's on his own project. *Originality.He has surprising,uncommon,interesting ideas.His drawings and stories have a style that marks them as his own. *Insight.He has easy access to realms of the mind that noncreative people visit only in their dreams.He toys with ideas that easily come to him. Qualities like these count very little in IQ tests,which measure memory,vocabulary,mathematical ability and general reasoning.These abilities are valuable,and the creative child does usually have them.However,the child with a socalled genius IQ of 180 is in reality no more likely to be a genius than the child with a slightly aboveaverage IQ of 120.In fact,evidence suggests that some children with high IQs may develop memory and logical reasoning powers at the expense of insight,imagination,and adventurous qualities that are essential to geniuses.

In the author's opinion,those who spend money on expensive houses and cars _ .	Wealth is what you accumulate ,not what you spend.If you make $1 million a year and spend $1 million,you're not getting wealthier,you're just living high. The most successful accumulators of wealth spend less than they can afford on houses,cars,vacations and entertainment.Why? Because these things offer little or no return.The wealthy would rather put their money into investments or their businesses.It's an attitude. Millionaires understand that when you buy an expensive house,you buy an expensive life-style too.Your property taxes ,insurance,and the prices of nearby services tend to be higher. The rich man's attitude can also be seen in his car.many drive old cars.Sam Walton,billionaire founder of the Wal-Mart Store,Inc,drove a pickup truck. Most millionaires measure success by net worth ,not income.Instead of taking their money home,they put as much as they can into their businesses.Why? Because the government doesn't tax wealth;it taxes income you bring home for consumption . The person who piles up net worth fastest tends to put every dollar he can into investments,not consumption. The best wealth-builders pay careful attention to their money and seek professional advice. The self-made rich develop clear goals for their money.They may wish to retire early,or they may want to leave something to their children.The goals vary,but two things are consistent:they have a goal in mind-- the amount they want to save by age50,perhaps--and they work unceasingly toward that goal. One thing may surprise you.If you make wealth---not just income--your goal,the expensive house you've been dreaming about won't seem so attractive.you'll have the attitude.

It can be inferred from the passage that in the research _ .	"Fumbling with the buttons to find a good song while driving has been linked to increased risk of crashes, but is listening to music risky? ""It depends on the music,"" says a report published in the October issue of Accident Analysis & Prevention. The study found teenage drivers who played their own music had significantly more traffic violations compared with background music designed by the researchers to minimize driving distractions, or no music. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University in Israel recruited 85 drivers about 18 years old; just over half were male. The _ were each assigned to drive six challenging road trips that were about 40 minutes long, accompanied by an experienced driving instructor. Music was played on four trips, two with selections from the drivers' playlists, mostly fast-paced vocals, and two with background music, which was a mixture of easy listening, soft rock and light jazz designed to increase driver safety. No music was played on two trips. Subjects rated their mood after each trip and in-car data recorders analyzed driver behavior and errors. All 85 subjects committed at least three errors in one or more of the six trips; 27 received a warning and 17 required steering or braking by an instructor to prevent an accident. When the music was their own, 98% made errors; without the music, 92% made errors; and while listening to the safe-driving music, 77% made errors. Speeding, following too close, inappropriate lane use, one-handed driving and were the common violations. The male subjects were more aggressive drivers and made more serious errors than female subjects. The teens played their own music at a very loud volume but significantly decreased the sound level when listening to the safe-driving music, researchers said. Mood ratings were highest on trips with driver-preferred music."	['driver-preferred music increased the mood ratings']

And he was far ahead of Wilson, the man in the second place. When the race was almost over, some people stood up and left. ""Why did stay?"" they thought. They were sure they knew who would win. But things did not go as they thought. A strange noise came from Dick's car. It slowed down. Something was wrong. Dick knew his car would not go far. His only hope was that he would make it to the finish. But on his last lap , the car stopped. Wilson's car roared by. Dick saw it go by. He knew he could not win now. ""But I can finish the race,"" he thought. And he got out of his car. So did his assistant. They began to push the car to the finish. Wilson went by them again and again. He was on his last lap. He was going to win. Dick and his friend did not care. They went on pushing. At first, all eyes were on Wilson. He crossed the line. And the race was over. He won! Dick and his friend pushed on. At last, the car crossed the line. By then all the people shouted for them. They shouted more than they did for Wilson. This was a different kind of winner!"	['The United States']

When the author first saw the cat, she _ .	When my father was dying, I traveled a thousand miles from home to be with him in his last days. It was far more heartbreaking than I'd expected, one of the most difficult and painful times in my life. After he passed away I stayed alone in his apartment. There were so many things to deal with. It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. But one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep. The next morning I checked with neighbors and learned that the cat had been abandoned by his owner who's moved out. So the little cat was there all alone, just like I was.

From this passage, we can infer that _ .	"He met her at a party. She was so outstanding that many guys were chasing after her, while he was so ordinary. At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him. She was surprised but due to being polite, she promised.

Which of the follow words can best describe the father?	"A light drizzle was falling as my sister Jill and I ran out of the Methodist Church, eager to get home and play with the presents that Santa had left for us and our baby sister, Sharon. Across the street from the church was a Pan American gas station where the Greyhound bus stopped.It was closed for Christmas, but I noticed a family standing outside the locked door, huddled under the narrow overhang in an attempt to keep dry. I wondered briefly why they were there but then forgot about them as I raced to keep up with Jill. Once we got home, there was barely time to enjoy our presents. We had to go off to our grandparents' house for our annual Christmas dinner. As we drove down the highway through town,I noticed that the family were still there, standing outside the closed gas station. My father was driving very slowly down the highway. The closer we got to the turnoff for my grandparents' house, the slower the car went. Suddenly, my father U-turned in the middle of the road and said, ''I can't stand it!"" ''What?"" asked my mother. ''They've got children. It's Christmas. I can't stand _ ."" When my father pulled into the service station, I saw that there were five of them: the parents and three children--two girls and a small boy. My father rolled down his window. ""Merry Christmas,"" he said. ""Howdy ,''the man replied. ''You are waiting for the bus?'' my father asked. The man said that they were. They were going to Birmingham, where he had a brother and prospects of a job. ""Well, that bus isn't going to come along for several hours, and you're getting wet standing here. Winborn is just a couple miles up the road. They've got a shed with a cover there and some benches"". My father said. ''Why don't you all get in the car and I'll run you up there."" The man thought about it for a moment, and then he beckoned to his family. They climbed into the car. They had no luggage, only the clothes they were wearing. Once they settled in, my father looked back over his shoulder and asked the children if Santa had found them yet. Three gloomy faces gave him his answer. ""Well I didn't think so,"" my father said, winking at my mother,""because when I saw Santa this morning, he told me that he was having trouble finding all, and he asked me if he could leave your toys at my house. We'll just go to get them before I take you to the bus stop."" All at once, the three children's faces lit up, and they began to bounce around in the back seat, laughing and chattering. When we got out of the car at our house, the three children ran through the front door and straight to the toys that were spread out under our Christmas tree. One of the girls spied Jill's doll and immediately hugged it to her breast. I remember that the little boy grabbed Sharon's ball. And the other girl picked up something of mine. All this happened a long time ago, but the memory of it remains clear. That was the Christmas when my sisters and I learned the joy of making others happy."	['Kindhearted.']
Tim Berners-Lee decided to write a program that would let academics from across the world share information on a single place when .	"Tim Berners-Lee is the man who wrote the software program that led to the foundation of the World Wide Web. Britain played an important part in developing the first generation of computers. The parents of Tim Berners-Lee both worked on one of the earliest commercial computers and talked about their work at home. As a child he would build models of computers from packing material. After graduating from Oxford University he went on to the real thing. In the 1980s, scientists were already communicating using a primitive version of e-mail. While working at a laboratory in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a program, which let him store these messages. This gave him another idea: write a program that will let academics from across the world share information on a single place. In 1990 he wrote the HTTP and HTML programs which form the basis of the World Wide Web. The next year his programs were placed on to the Internet. Everyone was welcome to use them and improve them if they could. Programmers used this codes to work with different operating systems. New things like web browsers and search engines were developed. Between 1991 and 1994 the number of web pages rose from 10 to 100,000. In 1994 Tim Berners-Lee formed the newly formed World Wide Web consortium , or W3C. More than 200 leading companies and laboratories are represented by W3C. Together they make sure that everyone can share equally on the web. ""The Web can help people to understand the way that others live and love. It helps us understand the humanity of people."" he says."	['he worked at a lab in Switzerland']
Which of the following statement is NOT TRUE?	"As rules, laws are people's rights and responsibilities toward society. Laws are agreed on by society and made official by governments. Some persons look on laws with fear, hatred, or annoyance. Laws seem to limit people's freedom to do many things they would like to do. Though laws may prevent us from doing things we wish to do at the moment, laws make everyone's life safer and more pleasant. Without laws we could not hold on to our property; we could not go to bed at night expecting to wake up in the morning and find that we had not been robbed; no stores in which we buy food, clothes, and other necessities could stay open and sell to us. Our banks would not be safe places to keep our money. Social life would be impossible without laws to control the way people treat one another. It is not the laws that should be feared but the trouble that comes to everyone when laws are broken. Once this is understood, a citizen will not fear or hate the law. Understanding the need for good laws and the evil results of breaking laws is the first requirement of good citizenship and government. Philosophers once believed that in prehistoric time people lived without laws in a ""state of nature"". People were free to do as they pleased unless someone stronger stopped them by force. As a result, life became so dangerous and unsafe that leaders had to create laws to protect life and property. This is no longer believed to be true. Scholars now think that as soon as people began living in small groups, they worked out rules for getting along with one another. In time everyone accepted and supported the rules. Manners, customs and beliefs controlled the living habits and behavior of the group. Such rules and habits of life are called folkways. Folkways are probably the real meaning of human laws, as well as of religion, morals, and education. As life became more complex, folkways became more complete guides to living. After thousands of years, some of the important folkways were put into writing as the earlier laws. And as life grew more and more complicated with faster transportation and the rise of modern industry and big cities, more human acts and interests had to be ruled by law. This led to a great increase in the number of laws. But we know that unless laws are enforced, they cannot protect us. Poorly enforced laws invite crime and violence. So we agree that the best protection against crime is planned social change and law reform -- to reduce the causes of crime and to encourage people to obey the laws. Such a solution would join a sound system of law enforcement with forces working to prevent crime. To attain this goal, all citizens must understand the need for good laws and for their enforcement."

"How does the passage show us ""Wenchuan has risen from the ruins""?"	"Do you still remember the terrible earthquake in 2008 in Sichuan, which killed at least 87,000 people and left millions homeless? On the twelfth day after the earthquake, Premier Wen Jiabao said, ""A new Wenchuan will rise from the ruins ."" Now his words have come true. Three years has passed and the worst-hit areas in Sichuan have risen from the ruins. So far, 95% of the reconstruction projects have been completed. Nearly 3,000 schools, 1,000 hospitals and more than 5 million homes have been built. Now everyone has been provided with a home, a job and social security . Dong Xinjun, a villager in Qingchuan, said volunteers from Zhejiang taught him how to grow mushrooms and now he makes about 3,000 yuan more than before every year. Zhu Lihu, the headmaster of a village primary school in Qingchuan, told us that teaching equipment had been greatly improved. Now they have new classrooms, a library and a computer room with 20 computers. On May 8th, 2011, Premier Wen Jiabao made his 10th visit to Sichuan Province after the earthquake. He visited a lot of middle schools and neighborhoods. At Beichuan Middle School, Premier Wen _ a student named Zheng Haiyang, who lost both of his legs in the earthquake. The students told Premier Wen that their new school was very beautiful. And they would never forget that it was built with the hearts and strength of people across the whole country. Premier Wen believes that the people in Wenchuan have a ""strong will"" and a ""bright future"". They will never back down, but stand bravely on this land."	['By giving facts and examples.']
What is tailgating?	Football is America's most popular sport, and by football I don't mean soccer. American football is a unique sport with its own rules, regulations, and fans. Being a football fan means something different than being a fan in other sports; football fans have their own culture and customs. Since football is a violent, contact sport, its games are played infrequently. Usually fans have to wait an entire week before they can see their favorite team play again. This means that football fans take advantage of the days they can cheer for their teams. One custom that football fans have is called tailgating. Tailgating describes when a big group of people gets together before a game and has a small party. Tailgating usually lasts a few hours and involves lots of good food and beverages. It is most common to grill food at a tailgate, especially hamburgers, hotdogs, sausages, and any other type of meat. It is not unusual to see people drinking lots of beer, throwing footballs around, talking to (or arguing with) other fans, etc. Tailgating happens for other sports too, but it is much more important to football fans. Sports fans in every country have unique and strange ways to celebrate their favorite teams and players. Football in America is no different.

It is implied that _ .	"How could I turn down an opportunity for a weeklong cruise on a luxury motorsailer in the Andaman Sea? Without a second thought, I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore, and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia. The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001, when it was relatively quiet. Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles. Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat, Alain, the captain, took us on a tour of Blue Gold's impressive accommodations. The master suite had a king-size bed, with a lounge area and ""his & hers"" wardrobes. The VIP cabin had a queen-size bed, also with a lounge area. Both had ensuite bathrooms. The first evening aboard was the perfect start to our voyage--a small cocktail party followed by a light meal of seared tuna salad. It was exactly what our jet-lagged bodies craved, and we all slept very well aboard what would become our new home for the next 7 days. In the morning after breakfast, we sailed to Pulau Ta Ngah (also spelled ""Pulau Tengah""; pulau means island in Malay). In the 1970s the site had been a Vietnamese refugee transit camp. Not long after the end of the war, the camp was shut down and the island was gazetted as a marine park by the Malaysian government. Officially ""uninhabited,"" it does boast a golf course, but we were unable to determine if it was still in operation. The most intriguing event on the island occurs in July when the giant leatherback turtles lay their eggs on a beach on Ta Ngah."	['the author liked the party and meal provided in the voyage']
What should people do to protect themselves from mobile phone radiation?	Many children think mobile phones are cool. They come in fun colors and let you talk with friends anytime and anywhere. In the U.S., more than 90 million people use mobile phones. Many of these people are children. For children, mobile phones are more than phone calls. They are fashionable. Most mobile phone users don't think about the health problems caused by mobile phones. Some scientists say that mobile phones give off radiation that might be bad for the users. One newest study shows that mobile phone radiation might raise a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer . Other scientists say mobile phones don't' threaten people's health. They say that they have not found any link between phone use and cancer. Scientists say that people can protect themselves from mobile phone radiation. One way is to use a headset .

What do you think of the man? _	"In the old time, there was a man. He wanted to buy a pair of new shoes. Hemeasured his feet with a straw , and then went to a shoe shop in town. The man in the shop took out a pair of new shoes, and let him try it on. But when he looked into pocket, he found that the straw was not there. So he said, ""I'm sorry. I forget to bring the size here! Let me go home to get it back."" After that, he ran out of the shop. It was very far from his home to the shoe shop. When he got back home, he was very tired.

Nowadays, if an average woman weighs 110 pounds, then a physically perfect woman should weigh about _ .	"Women, as all research suggests, are far more critical of their appearance than men. Most of them are likely to feel dissatisfied with their reflection in the mirror. It is quite possible that men looking in the mirror are either pleased with what they see or indifferent. Research shows that men generally have a much more positive body-image than women---if anything, they may tend to over-estimate their attractiveness. Some men looking in the mirror may literally not see the flaws in their appearance. Why are women so much more self-critical than men? Because women are judged more on their appearance than men, and standards of female beauty are considerably higher and more inflexible. Women are continually bombarded with images of the ""ideal"" face. And constant exposure to idealized images of female beauty on TV, magazines and billboards makes exceptional good looks seem normal and anything short of perfection seem abnormal and ugly. It has been estimated that young women now see more images of outstandingly beautiful women in one day than our mothers saw throughout their entire adolescence. Also, most women trying to achieve the impossible standards of female beauty have in fact become progressively more unrealistic during the last century. In 1917, the physically perfect woman was about 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed nearly 10 stone. Even 25 years ago, top models and beauty queens weighed only 8% less than the average women, now they weigh 23% less. The current media ideal for women is achievable by less than 5% of the female population---and that's just in terms of weight and size. If you want the ideal shape, face etc., it's probably more like 1%."	['85 pounds']

According to Norwegain researchers' finding, which of the following is linked to boys' IQ?	"Boys at the top of the pecking order either by birth or because their older brothers died score higher on IQ tests than their younger brothers. Norwegian researchers now report that it's a matter of what they call social rank in the family that gives the first born the highest scores or, if the first born had died young, the next oldest. Kristensen and Bjerkedal studied the IQ test results of 241,310 Norwegian men drafted into the armed forces between 1967 and 1976. All were aged 18 or 19 at the time. The average IQ of first-born men was 103.2, they found second-born men averaged 101.2, but second-born men whose older brother died young scored 102.9. And for third-borns, the average was 100.0. But if both older brothers died young,the third-born score rose to 102.6. The findings provide ""evidence that the relation between birth order and IQ score is dependent on the social rank in the family and not birth order as such."" they concluded. _ since at least 1874,when Sir Francis Galton reported that men in noticeable positions tended to be firstborns more often than would have been statistically expected. Since then, several studies have reported higher intelligence scores for firstborns, while other analyses have questioned those findings and the methods of those reports. ""These two researchers prove that how study participants were raised, not how they were born, is what actually influences their IQs,"" said Sulloway, an American professor, who was not part of the research team. ""The elder child pulls ahead,"" he said, ""perhaps as a result of learning gained through the process of tutoring younger brothers and sisters"". ""The older child benefits by having to organize and express its thoughts to tutor youngsters"", he said, ""while the later born children may have no one to tutor."""	['Position in the family']

What does this passage mainly talk about?	BEIJING - China's railway rates for freight and passenger transport will continue to be set by the government, announced a senior official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top economic planner, on Friday. Cao Changqing, head of the NDRC's department of price, said that the country will continue to implement government-set or government-guided prices for the railway sector after the China Railway Corporation (CRC), a State-owned company that takes over the commercial functions of the former Ministry of Railways (MOR), went into business on March 17. Cao said the railway sector, constituting China's main public transport facilities, is a key basic industry. Its pricing scheme is concerned with both the sector's normal operation and development, as well as the daily traveling and vital interests of the general public. The state will be very cautious in making any price adjustment in the railway sector, taking into account various factors including operation, construction, public acceptance and coordinated development with other modes of transport, according to the NDRC official. Under Chinese law and regulations, hearings will be held before adjustments in the basic passenger train ticket fare, Cao said. In China's latest railway reform, endorsed at the just-concluded annual session of the country's top legislature, the former MOR was dismantled into two parts, with the newly created CRC carrying out business functions and a state railways administration fulfilling administrative functions.	"[""China's railway pricing scheme unchanged""]"
According to the author, the patients improved mainly because _ .	Many people think that listening is a passive business. It is just the opposite. Listening well is an active exercise of our attention and hard work. It is because they do not realize this, or because they are not willing to do the work, that most people do not listen well. Listening well also requires total concentration upon someone else. An essential part of listening well is the rule known as 'bracketing'. Bracketing includes the temporary giving up or setting aside of your own prejudices and desires, to experience as far as possible someone else's world from the inside, _ . Moreover, since listening well involves bracketing, it also involves a temporary acceptance of the other person. Sensing this acceptance, the speaker will seem quite willing to open up the inner part of his or her mind to the listener. True communication is under way and the energy required for listening well is so great that it can be accomplished only by the will to extend oneself for mutual growth. Most of the time we lack this energy. Even though we may feel in our business dealings or social relationships that we are listening well, what we are usually doing is listening selectively. Often we have a prepared list in mind and wonder, as we listen, how we can achieve certain desired results to get the conversation over as quickly as possible or redirected in ways more satisfactory to us. Many of us are far more interested in talking than in listening, or we simply refuse to listen to what we don't want to hear. It wasn't until toward the end of my doctor career that I have found the knowledge that one is being truly listened to is frequently therapeutic In about a quarter of the patients I saw, surprising improvement was shown during the first few months of psychotherapy , before any of the roots of problems had been uncovered or explained. There are several reasons for this phenomenon, but chief among them, I believe, was the patient's sense that he or she was being truly listened to, often for the first time in years, and for some, perhaps for the first time ever.

Only a few minutes had passed when the man made Van stop his car again and drove him off, and he himself drove away very quickly. Van stood in the snow for a moment and then walked around to look for a taxi. Another half an hour had passed when Van got out of the taxi and ran into the hospital. But it was too late and nothing could be done. The man who had taken Van's car was standing by the person all the time. He was so sad! Only then did Van know that the man was the father of that badly hurt person!"	['Too Worried to Be Helpful.']

Experts are still not 100 percent sure that the two girls are fraternal twins because _ .	"Two years ago, the Funk family of suburban Chicago adopted a Chinese baby girl who had been abandoned on a sidewalk near a Yangzhou textile factory. Last year and halfway across the United States, the Ramirez family of suburban Miami adopted a girl who had been abandoned a week later on the same spot. Both families named their daughters Mia. It turns out, a first name and Chinese heritage aren't the only things the three-year-olds have in common. The girls' mothers--Holly Funk and Diana Ramirez--met on a website for parents who had gone through international adoptions. After a flurry of e-mails comparing photographs and biographical details, DNA testing proved the families' suspicions: The girls are probably fraternal twins. ""I was in shock,"" said Ramirez, who lives with her husband Carlos in Pembroke Pines, Florida. ""Well, now this is for real."" The Internet and Web groups revolving around international orphanages are increasingly being used to link adopted children with biological kin . The site that the Funks and Ramirezes used has a membership of 137 people, with 15 sets of twins and seven sets of siblings whose relationships have been confirmed. At a reunion on Friday at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, Mia Diamond Funk Mia Hanying Ramirez shyly surveyed each other, then reached for each other's hand. DNA tests established an 85 percent probability that the girls are at least half sisters. Scientists did not have a biological parent to test and reach a greater certainty, but given their ages and physical similarities, experts say it is likely they are fraternal twins. Douglas and Holly Funk hope to take Mia to Miami in October. Both sets of parents say they are committed to staying in touch and often let the twins talk to each other on the phone."

According to the passage, your success in high school mainly lies in _ .	High school students are some of the busiest people in the world. To get the most from all you do, you must be in control of your time. Otherwise decision that affect how well you play the game, what position you play and when you get to play will be decided for you. Your success in high school depends on your use of time. Here are some important things to remember. *Begin each term by filling in a master plan. First fill in things you must do (classes, work, practice, etc. that you can't change.) Then find the most effective use for these times. *Set a regular time and place for study. This will save your time in the long run. If you have a study hall in your school, use it! *Use daylight hours to study whenever possible. For most people for every hour of study done in daylight hours, it will take them one and a half hours to do the same task at night. *Take breaks. Don't plan marathon study time. Have a short rest before you study again. *By using flash cards or summary sheets, you can use odd times to study while you're waiting for class to start or for a friend to pick you up. *If possible, plan study time with a partner. Choose your partner wisely however. Make sure you study, not socialize. *Do the most difficult tasks for times when you are active. (For example, when you're energetic, it will become easier to solve maths questions; when you're tired, it will be impossible!) *Make a daily checklist. Do the most important tasks first.

What will most British people think of the new reform according to William Hague?	"Britain's longterm unemployed could be forced to carry out manual work or risk losing their welfare benefits under plans being put forward by the government. The U.S.style scheme would see the longterm jobless ordered to take up fourweek placements in order to get them used to having a fulltime job. The idea is part of major reforms, due to be unveiled this week, to make cuts to Britain's huge welfare bill, reduce dependency on benefits and weed out those earning money but not declaring it, papers said. ""What we are talking about here is people who have not been used to working having both the opportunity and perhaps a bit more of a push as well, to experience the workplace from time to time. The vast majority of people in Britain will think that is the right thing to do."" Foreign Secretary William Hague told BBC TV. Shortly after the ConservativeLiberal Democrat Union took power in May, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith unveiled plans to simplify the complex web of benefits available to reduce errors and inefficiencies. Duncan Smith said the system had become regressive and was not giving people the right encouragement to work as many were financially better off unemployed. Under his plans separate benefits for items such as housing, income support or disability will be replaced by a ""universal credit"" system whereby individual households would get a single welfare payment to ensure those in work would be better off. The Observer newspaper said that in return, longterm unemployed would be told to take up work placements of at least 30 hours a week for a fourweek period. If they refuse or fail to complete the programme, their jobseekers' allowance, worth 64.30 pounds a week for those over 25, could be stopped for at least three months."

The writer didn't eat at dinner table because _	"Yesterday, Dad and I made a big snowman. I was very cold, so Dad made some delicious soup and bread.

If you decide to change, you should start by _ .	"Life is full of change, and this leads to growth. Change is what keeps our lives moving, and allows us to achieve what we desire and deserve. Like it or not, we need to be willing to go with the flow, and be adaptable when something doesn't go according to plan. A catalyst is a person that causes something else to happen, and if you're not currently a catalyst for change, here are some things you can do to become one. Take a look at what you've got going on in your life right now. Write down everything that comes to mind. Is there anything that jumps out at you that you're not content with? Is there something that isn't moving forward as quickly as you would like it to? Identifying what you want to change is the first step to getting somewhere with it. Take the initiative to make change happen. Once you have identified what you want to work on changing, write down several possible ""next steps"" you can take to realizing that change. Whatever it is you want to change, you won't get very far without having specific actions in mind to carry out. Start small, and then focus on items that are a bit more involved or difficult and just keep going! When carrying out a change, it's great if you're able to _ , particularly if they can help you implement that change in some way. Be receptive to feedback, but realize that others' opinions are not golden. Also remember to give feedback when asked for it. Be sure it's genuine and that you are able to stand behind it. Create an environment for change. There is nothing more discouraging than trying to create change in an environment that is not conducive to it. It's like trying to stick to a diet in a house that is filled with chips, cookies, ice cream and chocolate; you are just making it more difficult for yourself. Change is good, and often leads to process improvement, increased productivity and efficiency. Take the initiative, and make changes to your life to get to where you want to go faster than you are going right now."	['making sure you know what to change']

Who created Joy?	"Perfume has been in existence for a long time. These days, certain perfumes are considered comparable to great works of art. Here are a few of the most famous perfumes in history. Chanel No.5 This perfume is probably the best-selling scent in the history of fragrance . Created by Ernst Beaux for Coco Chanel in 1921, it has been described as ""the world's most legendary fragrance"", and remains the company's most famous perfume. Shalimar Jacques Guerlain created this vanilla fragrance in 1925. The perfume takes its name from the Garden of Shalimar, which was built by Emperor Shah Jehan for one of his wives. It was an immediate hit in 1925 and is still extremely popular today. Joy Joy is famous for having been the most expensive perfume in the world at one point. It was created in 1930 by Henri Almeras for Jean Patou to lift the bad mood that had swept over the world after the 1929 stock market crash. L'Air duTemps Francis Farbon created Nina Ricci's L'Air du Temps in 1948. The fragrance is known for its spicy carnation and gardenia scents as well as its beautiful crystal bottle (designed by Lalique). Eternity Calvin Klein's second perfume was created by Sophia Grojsman in 1988. Known for its light, flowery scent, the perfume was listed in the Fragrance Hall of Fame in 2003. It is recommended for daytime wear. Angel This wildly popular perfume was created in 1992 by Olivier Cresp for Thierry Mugler. The perfume was an instant success. The perfume has often been described as ""delicious"", owing to its chocolatey scent. The perfume comes in beautiful star-shaped bottles. Angel perfume also comes in several bath and body products."

How well the members learn in the Project X program is shown by _ .	"As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder. Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage. Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X. Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme. ""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities. One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti. Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."""	['their annual creative performances']
If the blood soak through the cloth, you should _ .	External bleeding Apply direct pressure. Place a clean, folded cloth over the injured area and firmly apply pressure. If blood soaks through, do not remove it. Instead, cover that cloth with another one and continue to apply pressure to the wound for 7~10 minutes. If the bleeding is from the ear, place a clean bandage over the ear, lay the victim on his side, and allow the blood to drain out through the bandage. Elevate the injury. Position the wounded part of the body above the level of the heart if possible while you apply direct pressure. Know the pressure points. If direct pressure and elevation don't sufficiently slow the blood-flow, find a pressure point. Large arteries found close to the skin's surface supply blood to the head and to each arm and leg. The most common pressure points used during the first aid are located in the upper arms and in the creases above the upper legs. Apply pressure to the closest pressure point to the wound so that the artery is pressed between your fingers and the bone directly behind the artery. If using the pressure point on a leg, you may need to use the heel of your hand instead of your finger. Resort to a tourniquet (,). On very rare occasions everything listed above may fail. To prevent the victim from dying, you should apply a tourniquet. Once a tourniquet is applied, it should not be loosened or removed until the victim has reached medical help. Use a tourniquet ONLY if everything listed above has failed. If you use a tourniquet, write down somewhere on the victim the time when it was applied, so medical personal will know how long it has been in place.	['cover that one with another one and press it']

The best title of this passage should be _ .	Some countries have a large number of earthquakes. Japan is one of them, while others do not have many, for example, there are few earthquakes in Britain. There is often a great noise during an earthquake. The ground vibrates .Houses fall down. Railways are broken, which causes trains to turn over. Sometimes thousands of people are killed in different ways. About 60,000 were killed in 1783 in the south of Italy. Some people say that earthquakes often happen near volcanoes , but it is not true. The centres of some earthquakes are under the sea. The bottom of the sea suddenly moves. The powerful forces inside the earth break the rocks. The coast is shaken and great waves appear. These waves travel long distances and rush over the land when they reach it, breaking down houses and other buildings. Sometimes they break more buildings than the earthquake itself. A terrible earthquake happened in Assam, India, in 1986.The land near Shillong suddenly moved 1.5 feet to one side, and then back again. It continued to act like this 20 times a minute.Few buildings could stand what was happening and the great stones flew four feet up into the air. What kind of building stays up best in an earthquake? The Americans carefully studied the results of the earthquake at San Francisco(1906) and believed it best for buildings to be made with concrete walls together by steel frames. Such are the buildings that can't burn or fall easily.	['The Centres of Earthquakes']

The birds didn't get close to the old man at first because _ .	I once knew a man who was rich in his love for birds, and in their love for him . He lived in a grove full of all kinds of trees. He had no wife or children in his home. He was an old man with blue and kind eyes, and a voice that the birds loved. While he was at work in the grove, the birds came close to pick up the worms in the fresh earth he dug up. At first, they kept their distance from him, but they soon found he was a kind man, and would not hurt them, but liked to have them near him. They knew this by his kind eyes and voice, which tell what is in the heart. So, day by day their _ in his love grew in them. All the birds of the grove were soon his fast friends. They were on the watch for him, and would fly down from the green tree tops to greet him with their chirp . When he had no work to do, he took bread with him, and dropped the pieces on the ground. Down they would dart on his head and feet to catch them as they fell from his hand. He showed me how they loved him, He put a piece of bread in his mouth, with one end of it out of his lips, Down they came like bees at a flower, and flew off with it piece by piece, When they thought he slept too long in the morning, they would fly in and _ . They went with him to church, and while he sang his hymns in it, they sat in the trees, and sang their praises. So the love and trust of birds were a joy to the old man all his life long.

In what order did people do the following things?	Long, long ago there were only a few thousand people in the world. These people move form place to place over the land, hunting animals for food. No one knows how or when these people learned about growing food. But when they did, their lives changed. They did not have to look for food any more. They could stay in one place and grow it. People began to live near one another. And so the first village grew. Many people came to work in the villages. These villages grew very big. When machines appeared , life in the villages changed again. Factories were built. More and more people lived near the factories. The cities grew very big. Today some people are moving back to small towns. Can you tell why?	['c, e, a, d, b']

What is China's most urgent problem to be deal with in rescue work according to the passage?	Weeks have passed since the world lost contact with Malaysia Airlines flightMH370and its 239passengers and crew. Although there is little hope of finding any of the passengers and crew alive,China has been making all-out efforts to find what remains of the plane in the southern Indian Ocean,where the plane is believed to have crashed.The search operations involve the navy,the marine police,scientific research and so on.While China's authorities and military forces have passed the test,the search operations have also shown some weaknesses.It is necessary to address these problems because China is a nation that faces many natural disasters. Lack of professional equipment has been the most notable problem.Among all the ships involved in the search for MH370,only Nanhai jiu 115and Donghai jiu 101and a few other ships have professional rescue equipment.There are also gaps between China and the US in other technologies such as sea-probing equipment and telecommunications.China mainly sent transporter planes,which lacked the necessary equipment to probe the ocean.While the United States sent P-3C and P-SA planes and MH60-R helicopters with equipment that can probe to depths of 76meters and cover 770sq kilometers in four hours. China's technology clearly needs to be improved,After the plane lost contact on March 8,more than one satellite received signals from it,but there is no report of any of China's satellites receiving a signal. Besides technology,China urgently needs to strengthen its international soft power,because almost all the important information was first obtained by Western media,which put pressure upon the Malaysian government for more timely and accurate information.Chinese media mainly forwarded the news broken by their Western colleagues. Last but not least,more attention should be paid to international cooperation.The search and rescue efforts could well have been a race against time to save lives,but limited by international laws and the absence of cooperation mechanisms,China and some other countries involved did not fully share timely information.

In this passage the author implies that_.	"In sports the sexes are separate. Women and men do not run or swim in the same races. Women are less strong than men. _ . Women are called the weaker sex, or ,if men want to please them, ""the fair sex"". But boys and girls are taught together at schools and universities .There are women who are famous Prime Ministers, scientists and writers. And women live longer than men. A European woman can expect to live until the age of 74, a man only until he is 68. Are women's bodies really weaker? The fastest men can run a mile under 4 minutes. The best women need 4.5 minutes .Women's times are always slower than men's ,but some facts are a surprise. Some of the fastest women swimmers today are teenager girls. One of them swam 400 meters in 4 minutes 21.2 seconds when she was only 16. The first ""Tarzan"" in films was an Olympic swimmer ,Johnny Weissmuller. His fastest 400 meters was 4 minutes 59.1 seconds, which is 37.9 seconds slower than a girl 50 years later ! This does not mean that women are catching men up .Conditions are very different now ,and sport is much more serious .It is so serious that some women athletes are given hormone injections. At the Olympics a doctor has to check whether the women athletes are really women or not. It seems sad that sport has such problems. Life can be very complicated when there are two separate sexes!"

Which of the following eats only one type of food?	Many animals recognize their food because they see it. So do humans. When you see an apple or a piece of chocolate you know that these are things you can eat. You can also use other senses when you choose your food. You may like it because it smells good or because it tastes good. You may dislike some types of food because they do not look, smell or taste very nice. Different animals use different senses to find and choose their food. A few animals depend on only one of their senses, while most animals use more than one sense. Although there are many different types of food, some animals spend their lives eating only one type. The giant panda eats only one particular type of bamboo . Other animals eat only one type of food even when given the choice. A kind of white butterfly will stay on the leaves of a cabbage, even though there are plenty of other vegetables in the garden. However, most animals have a more varied diet . The bear eats fruits and fish. The fox eats small animals, birds and fruits. The diet of these animals will be different depending on the season. Humans have a very varied diet. We often eat food because we like it and not because it is good for us. In countries such as France and Britain, people eat foods with too much sugar. This makes them overweight, which is bad for their health. Eating too much red meat and animal products, such as butter, can also be bad for the health. Choosing the right food, therefore, has become an area of study in modem life.	['The white butterfly.']
When American youth fall in love with each other, they _ .	The trip to the United State opened my eyes to the fact that there are a lot of similarities as well as differences between American youth and French youth. The first difference is in appearance. Going around in the U.S., I found that American youth do not really care about their appearance. In the morning, they choose something in their closet and wear it with another thing, often of different colors and styles, without wondering whether their choices make them look strange. The reason behind this is that they don't care what people look like, but are just interested in their ideas. I think it's great, but it also causes problems. Since they don't care about their appearance, they don't really care about their weight. Often they get fat without realizing it. There are differences in relationships too. When the American youth fall in love, they don't really think of the future. Also, there are differences in the rules concerning behavior that is allowed. In some _ , the French are more accepting. For example, in America it is generally unacceptable to make physical display of love. Lovers, actually, can't kiss or hold each other everywhere they want. People think that not showing love in public places is a way to respect others. On the contrary, the French youth can do almost everything they want. As for other types of relationships, there are also big differences. Americans act differently from French people in front of unknown people. When an American girl, for example, arrives in front of people she has never met before, she will talk with them, trying to create a kind of tie between her and this new circle of people. The French girls will just think about rather than really do this kind of thing because they are too shy and lacking in self-confidence. To finish, I noticed that in American classes, when pupils want to say or ask something, they just do it. In general, they don't really care how the others will judge them. In France, it's not the same case. If somebody wants to ask something, he/she will think about it before speaking up. I appreciate the freedom in Americans' behavior, ideas, and ways of expressing themselves.	['will rarely display their love in public']

The reason why James attempted to kill himself was that _ .	Having experienced a shocking electrical accident, which caused him to become both blind and deaf,James Francos world became completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing threw him into such sorrow that he tried a few times to put an end to his life. His family, especially his wife, did their best to tend and comfort him and finally he regained the will to live. One hot summer afternoon, he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started all at once. He stood under a large tree to avoid getting wet, but he was struck by the lightning. Witnesses thought he was dead but he woke up 20 minutes later, lying face down in muddy water. He was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes, he could hardly believe what he saw: a tree and a muddy road. When Mrs. Franco came running up to him, shouting to their neighbors to call for help, he could see her and hear her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of James regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread and many doctors came to examine him. Most of them said that he regained his sight and hearing from the shock he got from the lightning. However, none of them could give a _ answer as to why this should happen. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since James lost his sight and hearing as a result of a sudden shock, perhaps, the only way for him to regain them was by another sudden shock.

What's the purpose of the speech?	Head teacher, teachers, grandparents, parents and classmates, I'm very proud that I have been chosen to speak to you all today. I'm a bit nervous as I've never made a speech before to so many people, so please forgive me if it shows! www.xkb1.com As we all know, this is the school leavers' party, and it's time to say goodbye to everyone. We're sorry to leave you at the end of our junior high school education, and we promise that we'll never forget the happy times we have spent in these buildings with you all. I'd like to thank three groups of people for the three things I've learnt while I've been a pupil at our school. The three things are friendship, love and knowledge. The first group is my friends, and what I've learnt is the importance of friendship. We've worked hard together, we've even shared some difficult times together, but we've also had a lot of fun. Many of us will go to new schools and we may not see each other so often in the future. Others will go on to senior high school and continue their close friendships. But friends don't have to see each other all the time. Sometimes the friends you treasure most are the friends you see less often. A life without old friends is like a day without sunshine. We'll always stay in touch. The second group is our parents and grandparents. We thank you for the love you have shown us during our years at junior high school, for making a home where we feel both safe and relaxed, and where we can prepare ourselves for our school days. We also thank you for your help with our homework. How many of us owe our good grades to the suggestions you have made during those long evenings? And finally, the third group is our teachers. We can never pay you back for your kindness, your patience, and gift of knowledge which you have offered us; sometimes you've made us work very hard. But you have always been fair and you'll always be our role models. There's a saying from Ireland which is a favourite of mine: Strangers are only friends you haven't met yet. I couldn't say it better myself. So from the bottom of my heart, I thank you all and wish you success for the future.	['To thank people.']
The fastest way to travel in New York City is _ .	"New York City is a very large city with 8 million people. How do so many people move on their way to work and school? In New York you can travel by subways, bus, taxi and private car. The subway runs on the railroad lines under the city. It crosses the city at different points and goes to all parts of the city. Travelling by subway is the fastest way to get around the city. The second way to travel is by bus. It is a slower way to travel. You can also travel by taxi. This is very expensive, but the taxi will take you to every place you want to go to. If traffic is heavy, the taxi will be slow. During the mornings and afternoons, there is the ""rush hour"". This is the time when the traffic is very heavy with people going to and from work.. The last way is to use your private car. It's not good to drive during the ""rush hour"". If there is an accident on the road, you will have to wait for a long time. The best time to travel is from 9 a.m to 4.pm . Traffic will be less crowded during this time because most people are already at school or at work at that time."	['by subway']
According to the author, future hitchhikers are more likely to _	We all remember seeing hitchhikers , standing by the side of the road, thumb sticking out, waiting for a lift. But it is getting rare nowadays. What killed hitchhiking? Safety is often mentioned as a reason. Movies about murderous hitchhikers and real-life crime have put many drivers off picking up hitchhikers. That no single women picked me up on my journey to Manchester no doubt reflects the safety fear: a large, strangely dressed man is seen as dangerous. But the reason may be more complex: hitchhiking happens where people don't have cars and transport services are poor. Plenty of people still hitchhike in Poland and Romania. Perhaps the rising level of car ownership in the UK means the few people lift hitchhiking are usually considered strange. Why can't they afford cars? Why can't they take the coach or the train? Three-quarters of the UK population have access to a car; many of the remainder will be quite old. The potential hitchhiking population is therefore small. Yet my trip proves it's still possible to hitchhike. The people who picked me up were very interesting-lawyer, retired surgeon, tank commander, carpenter, man who live in an isolated farmhouse and a couple living up in the mountains. My conclusion is that only really interesting people are mad enough to pick up fat blokes in red, spotted scarves. Most just wanted to do someone a good turn; a few said they were so surprised to see a hitchhiker that they couldn't help stopping. The future of hitchhiking most likely lies with car-sharing organized over the Internet, via sites such as hitchhikers. org. But for now, you can still stick your thumb out(actually, I didn't do much of that, preferring just to hold up my destination sign) and people-wonderful, caring, sharing, unafraid people-will stop. In the UK, with its cheap coaches and reasonable rail service, I don't think I'll make a habit of it. But having enjoyed it so much, I'm ready now to do a big trip across Europe and beyond. In the 1970s a female friend of my wife's hitchhiked to India. How wonderful it would be to have another go, though Afghanistan might be a challenge. I wish I'd got that tank commander's mobile number.	['visit websites and find people to share cars with']
It can be inferred from the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic that _ .	"The $ 11 billion self - help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "" I never do anything right"" into positive ones like ""I can succeed."" But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, ""I am lovable."" Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking."	['forcing a person to think positive thoughts may lower their self - esteem']
What surprised the author was that _ .	"""Excuse me,"" said a young man , standing shyly at the open church door. "" I'm here to pick up an Easter basket for my daughter. Am I in the right place ?"" "" Well, we have baskets, but they're not Easter baskets for kids; they're food baskets,""I explained. That morning I arrived at St. Michael's Church in Carmichael, California, to help give out the baskets to needy families for Easter. To make sure every family would receive one, we had handed out numbers to them that matched the baskets they were supposed to receive . Each one contained a whole ham, potatoes, bread,vegetables, and a pie--enough food to help feed a family for a week. ""Why don't you come in ?"" I said to the man. He looked disappointed. He shook his head and said,"" I can't ...My daughter is waiting for me over there.I'm grateful for the food,but when I heard you were giving away baskets for Easter...well, I thought they would be Easter baskets for children."" He continued, ""I promised my daughter one ,and I wanted to surprise her."" I felt bad, but there was nothing I could do.The man hadned me his number, and I walked over to the baskets. A bulge in one of the baskets caught my eye. "" What is that ?"" I wondered. Leaning over and looking more closely, I could see, unmistakably, an Easter basket filled with candy, chocolate, and Easter eggs.One of the volunteers must have added it by mistake! I thought. Then I looked at the man's number in my hand.Well, he'll be..... ""Happy Easter,"" I said to the man , handing him the only food basket with an Easter basket inside -the very same basket with his number on it. "" Someone knew just what you needed."""

Why did John talk about the weather when the writer was looking at the bill? _	"Our village carpenter , John Hill, came one day and made a dining table for my wife. He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two windows. When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for the job. My wife said to me quietly, ""It's his ninth cup of tea today."" But she said in a loud voice, ""It is a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?"" ""I will decide about that when I see the bill, "" I read: One dining table, 10 November, 1989. Cost of wood: $17.00 Paint: $1.50 Work: 8 hours ($1 an hour) $8.00 Total: $36.50 When I was looking at the bill, John said, ""It's been a fine day, hasn't it? Quite sunny."" ""Yes,"" I said, ""I'm glad it is only the 10thof November."" ""Me, too,"" said John. ""You wait. It'll be a lot colder by the end of the month."" ""Yes, colder.... And more expensive! Dining tables will be $20 more expensive on November 30th, won't they, John?"" John looked hard at me for half a minute. Was there a little smile in his two blue eyes? I gave his bill back to him. ""If it isn't too much trouble, John,"" I said, ""Please add it up again and you can forget the date."" I paid him $26.50and he was happy to get it."

The traffic accident happened because _ .	"Mike found a job in a bookstore after he finished middle school. He wouldn't do anything but wanted to get rich. It was a cold morning. It snowed and there was thin ice on the streets. Few people went to buy books and the young man had nothing to do. He hated to read, so he watched the traffic. Suddenly he saw a bag fall off a truck and it landed by the other side of the street. ""It is full of expensive things."" Mike said to himself. ""I have to get it right now, or others will take it away."" He went out of the bookstore and ran across the street. A driver saw him and began to whistle , but he didn't hear it and went on running. The man drove to the side, hit a big tree and hurt himself in the accident. Two weeks later, Mike was taken to the court . A judge asked if he heard the whistle when he was running across the street. He said that something was wrong with his ears and he could hear nothing. ""But you heard me this time,"" said the judge. ""Oh, I'm sorry. Now I can hear with one ear."" ""Cover the ear with your hand and listen to me with your deaf one. Well, can you hear me?"" ""No, I can't , sir."" ""You told a lie. There is nothing wrong with either of your ears,"" the judge said."	['Mike was running to the street']
The best title of the passage should be _ .	What is the color1 of the universe? Astronomers had not answered this question, until two months ago. That is when two American astronomers reported on their study of all the light in the universe. They said that the universe would appear to the human eye to be a light greenish color1, called turquoise . Karl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, reported their finding in January. They presented the research at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. They said that finding the color1 of the universe was not part of their serious scientific research. They did it for fun. However, earlier this month, the scientists admitted to making a mistake. They said their finding was much more color1ful than it should have been. They now say the light from our universe is closer to white. It is more like a milky or creamy white color1. Their study attempted to show what people might see if they could observe the universe from far away. The scientists found the average color1 by combining light from about two-hundred-thousand star systems. Their information came from an observatory in New South Wales, Australia. These scientists and color1 engineers attempted to reproduce the result. Mark Fairchild of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York was the first person to identify a mistake. He discovered a mistake in the computer software program used by the Johns Hopkins scientists. When the mistake was corrected, the results changed. The new color1 of the universe is much less color1ful. It is very close to white. The scientists have apologized for the mistake. They are now working with the Rochester Institute of Technology to produce more images of the color1 of the universe. They also asked for suggestions for a name for the new color1 of the universe.

The mice in northern Europe move when _ .	"We know that many animals do not stay in one place.Birds,fish and other animals move from one place to another at a certain time.They move for different reasons:most of them move to find food more easily,but others move to get away from places that are too crowded. When cold weather comes,many birds move to warmer places to find food.Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed.The most famous migration is probably the migration of fish,which is called ""Salmon"".This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water.There it spends its life.When it is old,it returns to its birthplace in fresh water.Then it gives birth and dies there.In northern Europe,there is a kind of mouse.They leave their mountain homes when they become too crowded.They move down to the low land.Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside,and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea. Recently,scientists have studied the migration of a kind of lobster .Every year,when the season of bad weather arrives,the lobsters get into a long time and start to walk across the floor of the ocean.Nobody knows why they do this,and nobody knows where they go. So,sometimes we know why humans and animals move from one place to another,but at other times we don't.Maybe living things just like to travel."	['the place gets too crowded']
How did the volunteers react when smelling something nice and hearing musical notes?	"Scientists have proved that sleeping and learning go hand in hand. Even a short nap can boost our memory and sharpen our thinking. But the relationship goes deeper than that. ""The brain is not passive while you sleep,"" scientist Anat Arzi said. ""It's quite active. You can do many things while you are asleep."" Arzi and her coworkers didn't try to teach the sleeping volunteers any complex information, like new words or facts. Instead, the scientists taught volunteers to make new connections between smells and sounds. When we smell something good, like a flower, we take deep breaths. When we smell something bad, we take short breaths. Arzi and her co-workers based their experiment on these reactions. Once the volunteers fell asleep in the lab, the scientists went to work. They gave them a whiff of something pleasant and meanwhile played a particular musical note. They didn't wake up, but they heard--and sniffed deeply. Then the scientists gave the volunteers a whiff of something terrible and played a different musical note. Again, the volunteers heard and smelled--a short snort this time--but didn't wake up. The researchers repeated the experiment. After just four repetitions, volunteers made a connection between the musical notes and their paired smells. When the scientists played the musical tone that went with good smells, the sleepers breathed deeply. And when the scientists played the musical tone that went with bad smells, the sleepers breathed briefly--despite there being no bad smell. The next day, the volunteers woke up with the sound-smell connection. They breathed deeply when hearing one tone and cut their breaths short when hearing the other, which must have been unusual for them. Imagine walking down the street and taking a deep breath upon hearing a particular sound!"	['They took a deep breath.']
Team building activities are good for _ .	When it comes to human resources, hiring highly-skilled staff is not usually enough for a company to function successfully. Besides the knowledge in their particular fields, employees must always have additional skills-----those of co-operation. In the case that work tasks can only be carried out by communicating with people, accepting common decisions, solving problems, sharing information and helping one another, teamwork skills are important. While some jobs may require talent, the ability to work as a team is learned. There are no complicated formulas ; you don't need to have any special qualities or exceptional mental abilities. Individuals can be effective as a team if they have developed certain behaviors or habits of communication. Many companies, clubs and organizations use team building activities. Team building activities may include a number of teamwork elements. They are aimed at encouraging active participation in task accomplishment while all members have their roles as individuals and are able to co-operate towards a common goal as a team. Many team building activities focus on problem solving and discussing team issues; thus argument as a way to common consensus is encouraged. Team building activities often involve recognition and identification of team member skills, talents, knowledge, and experiences which allow the team members to learn more about each other and fully utilize those skills where appropriate . Many team activities are focused on developing keys to trust during challenging times.	['encouraging employees to co-operate']
Alan's mother's worries were _ .	"Alan Tong was the worst driver in town. He had an accident of some kind almost every week. Alan lived with his mother. His mother was always worried about him. Every day she worried that police would turn up to arrest him. This wasn't a foolish worry because they usually called on the Tong household about once a week to deliver a speeding ticket or to serve him notice to appear in court. Most of his accidents were caused by his carelessness. He drove through red lights. He turned right without signaling. He drove at night without proper lights. He overtook other cars on hills and sharp curve. In short there wasn't a traffic regulation Alan had not broken, and he had had so many accidents that it was a miracle he was still alive. But luckily for Alan, he had never hurt anyone in his accidents or even gone to the hospital. Although Alan wasn't popular with the police, he was very popular with his lawyer. Alan's lawyer, Mr.Tsui, had earned a lot of money from Alan's cases and always rubbed his hands expectantly when he saw Alan coming into his office. One day Alan was working in the garage spraying painting his car when his mother walked in. ""What are you doing?"" his mother asked. ""Painting my car,"" Alan replied. ""I can see that,"" his mother said, ""but why are you painting one side of the car red and the other side blue?"" ""Because every time I have to go to court for a traffic offense, there are always two witnesses . ""What color1 was the car?"" the prosecutor always asks, and the two witnesses always give the same answer. Well, in the future, one witness will say it was blue. Mr. Tsui will then say to the judge, ""Your honor, the witnesses cannot even agree on the color1 of the car involved in the accident."" And the judge will have to dismiss the case against me."

"The best title of the text would be "" _ ""."	"A captain of a boat lost his way in the middle of a storm. While trying to control the ship and avoid sinking, he started feeling annoyed. The water became bigger; the noise of the water hitting the boat, like a feather carried by the wind, almost led him to hopelessness. But he did not give up and tried harder every time the waves hit the boat. In his desperate attempts to stay strong and keep the boat steady, he was unable to hear one of his crew officers yelling at him. ""Captain, Captain!"" kept yelling the officer. He held on to one of the deck's bars in order not to fall off the boat, ""Captain, Captain!"" insisted the officer. This time, while the officer was trying to approach him, a huge wave almost made the boat turn over and he fell and rolled on the deck till he luckily found another bar to hold on to. After several attempts, the officer finally was able to reach his fighting and tired captain, who had started to yell out his frustration and thoughts to the angry waves. ""If I am a good and hard-working man, why does this happen to me? And why can't I get out of this one?

At that moment, his crew officer was able to catch the captain's shoulder and make him turn so that the captain could hear him. ""Captain, Captain!"" yelled again the officer. The captain looked at him angrily because the officer distracted him from his difficult task. ""What do you need, officer? Don't you see I am trying to control the ship and find our way back?"" complained the captain. His officer kept holding on to the captain and pointed at the opposite direction, towards the stern . ""Captain!"" he replied. ""The lighthouse is right over there, on the other side. We are going in the wrong direction!!"""	['The Lighthouse']
What do you know about Steven?	Steven drives a school bus, but his bus isn't the same as other school buses because there aren't any children on it. There are only dogs. Steven's bus takes dogs to school at 8:00 in the morning and brings them back home at 5:30 in the afternoon. Steven takes the dogs to a dog school. There he teaches the dogs to do many things: sit down, stand up, bring the shoes to the master, keep the master from danger . Many dogs go to Steven's school--big dogs, small dogs, old dogs, young dogs. Steven says that young dogs can learn more quickly.	['He teaches dogs in a school.']

What does Heyman think of parental lying?	"Parents say that honesty is the best policy, but they regularly lie to their children as a way of influencing their behavior and emotions, finds new research from the University of Toronto and the University of California. Surprisingly little has been published on the subject of parental lying, so Gail Heyman, professor of psychology at the University of California, Diem Luu, a former student of the University of California, and Kang Lee, professor at the University Toronto, set out to explore the under - researched phenomenon.They asked US participants in two related studies about parents lying to their children - either for the purpose of promoting appropriate behavior or to make them happy. In one of the studies, many parents reported they told their young children that bad things would happen if they didn't go to bed or eat what they were supposed to.Other parents reported inventing magical creatures.One explained, ""We told our daughter that if she wrapped up all her pacifiers like gifts, the fair would come and give them to the children who needed them."" In the other study, the researchers surveyed college students'recollections about their parents'lying and obtained similar results: parents often lie to their children even as they tell them that lying is unacceptable. The researchers refer to this practice as ""parenting by lying"".""We are surprised by how often parenting by lying takes place,"" said LEE.Though Heyman thinks that there are occasions when it is appropriate to be less than truthful with a child, she urges parents to think through the issues and consider alternatives before using lies."" Children sometimes behave in ways that are disruptive or are likely to harm their long - term interests,"" said Heyman.""It is common for them to try out a range of strategies, including lying, to stop them.However, parents should be concerned about the possible long - term negative consequences tochildren's beliefs about honesty."""

What may be the cause for the reality gap?	"A new study from Harvard University revealed that the message parents mean to send to children about the value of sympathy is being mistaken by the message they actually send. In fact they value achievement and happiness above all else. The Making Caring Common Project at Harvard's Graduate School of Education surveyed 10,000 middle and high school students about which is more important to them--achievement, happiness, or caring about others. Almost 80 percent of students placed achievement or happiness over caring about others. Only 20 percent of students considered caring about others as their top aim. In the study ""The Children We Mean to Raise: The Real Message Adults Are Sending about Values"", the authors refer to a reality gap, an incongruity between what adults tell children they should value and the message we grown-ups actually send through our behavior. Simply talking about sympathy is not enough. While 96 percent of parents say they want to raise caring children, and cite the development of moral character as ""very important, if not essential"", 80 percent of the youths surveyed reported that their parents ""are more concerned about achievement and happiness than caring about others"". Approximately the same percentage of the students reported that their teachers put their achievement over caring. As the report shows, simply talking about sympathy is not enough. Children are sensitive creatures, fully capable of telling the true meanings in the blank spaces between well-organised words. If parents really want to let their kids know that they value care and sympathy, the authors suggest, they must make a real effort to help their children learn to care about other people--even when it's hard, even when it does not make them happy, and yes, even when it is at odds with their personal success."

When reading reviews if the eye creams, you should _ .	Lines around the eyes mean the aging process in the body. Though aging is considered as one of the most unavoidable occurrence in one's life, it is not entirely the thing. You just need to know that you can deal with it in your life. For example, if you are willing to spend a considerable amount of money to make yourself look young again, then you can try eye lifts. However, if you are more of the money-conscious type, then you should decide to go for eye creams which bring the same results but with lower prices. Despite of the advantages of using eye creams, however, there is a disadvantage in trying them. This is due to the hundreds of brands o eye creams being marketed at present. If you do not know how to choose the best eye cream in the countless brands available, then you might fall victim to eye creams that do not really fulfill their promised effects. What's good is that looking for the best eye cream does not involve too much effort. You just have to look for eye cream reviews to know how a product performs and if it lives up to its promises. If you have a dermatologist , then you can ask for advice. If you have none, however, then you can just browse on the net for the best cream for your needs. In searching for eye cream reviews, look for those with reviews based on the results of product testing. Doing so can ensure you that you are not basing your decision on fake review sites that are only made to build up an image of a certain product. Follow these tips and guidelines and you are sure to finally spot the best eye cream that can solve your aging problem.	['notice the function of the products']
The climate of Australia _ .	"Australia is famous for its beautiful beaches. And Australian people love swimming and going to the beach. But it wasn't always that way. Different Climate, Different habits When Europeans first invaded Australia, the only people here who were good at swimming were the Aboriginal people. The Europeans came from climates where it was too cold to swim. Also some people worried that they would get sick if they wet their whole body. However the warm climate of Australia soon changed their attitude to swimming. At first, only men swam. They swam naked - there were no women to see them. Cover up! By the 1880's and 90's visiting the beach was very fashionable and a lot of people went there, especially in warm weather. They wore everyday street clothes - much more than people wear at the beach today. In those days, people believed they should cover most of their body so it would not be seen by the opposite sex. Special bathing costumes were designed for women. These costumes used a lot of cloth and were very heavy when wet, making it difficult to swim. Laws Made and Laws Changed The government decided to stop men swimming naked.It passed a law which forbade bathing between 6am and 7pm. Many people objected to this law and wrote letters to the government asking it to change the laws. In 1903, the laws changed; people could swim in the daytime, but they had to wear neck-to-knee costumes. The Shrinking Costume As time passed, swimming costumes became smaller and more convenient. At first men and women were covered from neck to knee. Then the arms became bare. Then more of the legs were uncovered.Each new change was regarded by many as shocking and rude and people wrote letters to the newspapers complaining about the new costumes. Nowadays some people go to special ""nude beaches"" to swim naked. However, most people cover their bodies more than they did ten years ago -- not because they think bare skin is shocking -- but to protect their skin from the harmful rays of the sun."

Which of the following can best describe the children's feelings while making their first bread?	"""Mom, can I bake some bread?"" We were 15, my best friend, Hanna, and I, determined to try our hands at creating some beautiful bread. ""It's not worth the trouble,"" my mother said. ""It takes lots of time and makes a big mess. Our bakery bread is delicious without all that effort."" Begging was useless. Mom's ""no"" meant ""No!"" But several weeks later, opportunity knocked: My parents were going out for the evening. I immediately invited Hanna to be my partner in bread-baking crime. We studied the recipe. That was easy. ""Mix oil into flour then beat in four of the eggs, one at a time, with remaining sugar and salt."" We were not good at breaking eggs. I tried to learn from my mother. ""Gradually add eight cups of flour. When dough holds together, squeeze it."" We took turns working like that. ""Is the dough 'holding together'?"" we asked each other. I remembered my neighbor's instructions: ""If it's too sticky, add some flour; if too dry, add water."" We added water. Then more flour. Then more water. By then, the mass of our dough had grown very much. ""Place dough on floured surface and squeeze till smooth,"" the recipe instructed. We took turns burying our hands in the damp dough, pinching, squeezing, and feeling it leak between fingers. ""Clean and oil bowl, then return dough to bowl. Cover and let dough rise in warm place for 1 hour."" This was good news --- we'd have a break. On dirtied kitchen chairs, we dreamed about our beautiful bread. ""See?"" we would tell my mom. ""Isn't it worth the work?"" Hanna and I couldn't help glancing at the rising process every few minutes. But nothing was happening. ""Maybe something will happen in the hot oven,"" I said. Unfortunately, when we removed the loaves from the oven, they were like hard stones. Mom was right; it takes time and effort. It sometimes makes a mess. But still it feels good, somehow, to be part of that long, ongoing chain of bread bakers. Since that night, both Hanna and I have learned to do it right."	['Curious; hopeful; disappointed.']
How many instruments did George Dennehy master according the passage?	Although 19-year-old George Dennehy is armless, he isn't letting that stop him from pursuing his dreams and sharing his passion with the world. Born without arms, the young boy's birth parents left him. Luckily, a warm-hearted couple _ him and took good care of him. However, his new parents never allowed him to use his disability as an excuse to be lazy. When George turned eight, they asked him to sign up for cello lessons. The instrument is tough even for people who have the use of both their hands, so it was even more challenging for George, who had to learn to play it with his feet. Thanks to his music teacher, the young boy not only mastered the cello, but also realized that he had a passion and talent for music. During middle school years, he also mastered the piano and guitar. His music talent caught the eye of an American rock band who invited him to perform alongside them at a ten-day-long music festival. The experience has inspired this once shy boy to pursue a career in music. He has also become a motivational speaker who encourages both able and disabled people to pursue their dreams, no matter how impossible these dreams may sound. Geoge Dennehy is armless, he isn't letting that stop him from pursuing his dreams and sharing his passion with the world.	['3']
You may find this article _ .	On August 4, while a young man in Hangzhou was caught because of killing another young man with his car, a 17-year-old girl died because of the same reason in the same city. It's reported that the driver was badly drunk. Cars are more and more popular for more Chinese these days. And the numbers of car accidents are increasing. From 1994 to 2008, deaths because of drunk-driving increased 7.3%. In 2009, a total of 18,371 people were killed in car accidents because of drunk driving. In the middle of August, there were some new rules to deal with the drunk drivers: 1. If a driver's alcohol content is 20mg per 100 ml of blood, he is regarded as a drunk driver. 2. If a driver's alcohol content is 80mg per 100ml or more, he will be held for 15 days and have their license revoked for six months, and are given a fine of 2,000 yuan. The first weekend, 3,167 drivers were held because of high levels of alcohol in their blood. So many people are calling for the law to deal with drunk drivers in order to make drivers understand that drunk drinking can make serious problems.	['in a newspaper']
The Norwegian government has tried to _ .	"The Norwegian government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long. Ever since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most against the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the sea and to the countryside and to the whole country. One Norwegian politician said last week, ""We will soon be changed beyond all recognition."""	['keep the oil industry to something near its present size']
What's the main idea of the text?	"Many years ago my student asked me the question, ""Mrs. Kindred, why do you teach?"" Without taking time to reflect, I answered, ""Because someday I might say something that might make a difference in someone's life."" Even though I was sincere, that wasn't a very good answer and my student didn't let it slide. ""Let me get this straight,"" he said, ""You went to college for four years so you could come here every day because you have the hope that someday you might say something that will influence someone?"" He shook his head as if I were crazy and walked away looking confused. I'm one of those people who look back and wish they had said something smart or witty, or swift. Even though that particular student might no longer wonder why I teach, there are days when I wonder. On those days, I remind myself of the real reasons I teach: It's in my blood. My mother was my most influential teacher, and she was a 6th grade reading teacher until her death in 1990. She instilled in me a love of reading and the knowledge that education opens doors. Teaching is a way to make a difference. If you throw a stone in a pond the ripples go on and on until they reach the shore. You can't have ripples without a ""stone."" Good teachers throw stones that make a positive difference, and that's what I strive to do. I genuinely love teenagers. I want to share with others what I know and what I have learned through the years. Life is full of ups and downs, and if I can help students avoid some potholes on the road of life, I want to do so. If they'll allow me to celebrate their victories with them, I want to do too. Teaching isn't for everyone, but I know I made the right career choice."	['The reason why I teach.']
According to the passage, the disease muscular dystrophy may make a person _ .	"Mattie Stepanek died at the age of 13 from a rare disease called muscular dystrophy. Because of the disease, Mattie had to get around in a wheelchair, but it did not stop him from staying positive and inspiring others with his message of peace. As a best-selling author and role model, Mattie provided a voice for people who suffer from muscular dystrophy. He spoke to people about the disease and about his dream for world peace. ""Mattie was something special, something very special,"" said Jerry Lewis, the chair of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a group that works to find a solution to the disease. ""He was an example that made people want to reach for the best within themselves."" Mattie moved many people through his speeches and interviews, but he may have touched the most people through his poetry. During his life, Mattie wrote five books of poetry. Three of those books were The New York Times best-sellers. His books all had the word ""Heartsongs"" in the title. Mattie called his inner voice that encouraged him to work for peace his ""Heartsongs"". When his first book came out, just 200 copies were printed to be handed out to friends and supporters. But after the news of the book spread, 500,000 more copies were printed. People think Mattie's poems are very thoughtful. Mattie first started writing poetry at the age of 3 to help him face the death of his brother, who also suffered from muscular dystrophy. The magazine Time For Kids once interviewed Mattie. He told the reporter, ""Life is a gift. We have to make the best of it."" Mattie said his task was to bring peace to the world."	['difficult to move his body']
Attending continuing education classes _ .	Ideas about education are changing in the United States. Education today is not just a high school diploma or a college degree. Many adults are not interested in going to college. They are interested in other kinds of learning. For them, learning does not end with a diploma. Continuing education gives these adults the chance to increase their knowledge. It also gives them a chance to improve their old skills or to learn new ones. If they know more or learn more, then they can get a better job or earn more money. There are usually a large number of classes to choose from. Some adults learn new skills. Some take classes for fun or because the class will be useful for them. Others take classes to improve their own lives because they want to feel better about themselves. And still others learn how to be good parents, or how to get along with other people. There are many chances for adults to continue their learning. Almost any community college or public school system has a continuing education program. There are classes in schools, buildings, or churches. Most classes are in the evening, so working people can attend. The classes are usually small, and they are inexpensive. Thousands of people take continuing education classes each year. They receive no diploma and no grade for most of the classes they attend. For them, learning is something they do because they want to.	['does not cost much money']

Observation of the same person by two people at the same time may differ because _ .	"When several different people look at the same person,it's not unusual for each of them to see different things;when you alone observe one behavior or one person at two different times,you may see different things.The following are but some of the factors that lead to these changing perceptions . (1)Each person's perceptions of others are formed by his or her own cultural conditioning education,and personal experiences. (2)Sometimes perceptions differ because of what we choose to observe and how we deal with what we've observed.It is not necessarily true that person's perception is based on observations of a particular person.Your observations may be totally controlled by what others have told you about this person;or you may focus primarily on the situation or role relationship.Most people do not use the same yardstick to measure their parents,their friends and strangers. (3)Sometimes we see only what we want to see or don't see what may be obvious to others because of our own needs,desires,or temporary emotional states.This is a process known as selective perception.Selective perception is obviously more difficult when contradictory information is particularly obvious,but it can be done.We can ignore the "" _ "".He's basically a good boy so what I saw was not shoplifting.

What advantage do women have over men in driving?	It has always been said that women are not good drivers, because they simply don't have very good driving ability. On the other hand, most car accidents happen to men; very few happen to women. From this, we can see that women are much more careful while driving. Another very interesting fact that we should point out is that in the past, women preferred to let their husbands be the only driver in the family rather than have a driving license. Somehow they were prevented from making this step in their lives, but nowadays there are many women that want to pass their driving tests from an early age. However, we have to admit that men are more skillful drivers than women, but this does not mean that a woman cannot become a good driver by accumulating experience. So more and more teenagers and women around the age of thirty now want to pass their driving tests. While taking their driving lessons, they also have a number of special lessons with their parents or somebody in the family that has a driving license, this is just to improve their driving abilities and help them to pass the tests more easily. To conclude, we can say that women are not such bad drivers. They just need more experience than men in order to be able to drive well. And on the other hand, there are a number of women that show better driving skills than the men around them.	['They are much more careful']

The kid's words suggest that the author _ .	In our life, there are always some days that will never be forgotten. This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered. I just walked along following my family, with my head held up, my shoulders back and my chest pushed out proudly enjoying the fact that, at that moment in time, on that particular day in life, I was my children's hero.

"The author ""wrote the text to _ """	In the September of my gap year, I left school to take a semester-long outdoor leadership course run by the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) in the region of South America called Patagonia. The concept of the course is to give students a chance to really develop both outdoor skills and life skills. The NOLS does an amazing job in designing their courses so that students get a full range of experiences from which they can learn many new things. We spent the first part of our semester obtaining our Wilderness First Responder certificates. This involved a 10-day, 80-hour, EMT taught course at the NOLS base camp in Patagonia. We learned many medical skills that all could be applied to everyday environments as well as the wilderness we were about to enter. After the first part of the semester, we set off on a 30-day sea expedition along the coast of the southern tip of Chile. During this expedition we learned a lot of useful skills for our future life. What excited me most was to see a large glacier pouring right out into the sea. It was unlike anything I had ever seen, and the satisfaction of reaching such a remote place all with my own power was amazing. The next part of our semester was another 30-day expedition traveling through the Andes mountain range of southern Chile and Argentina. Again we learned many technical outdoor skills and some great life skills, such as how to be effective leaders and how to function as a single group. The highlight of this part was being able to ice climb on a glacier using anchors and ropes that we set up ourselves. The final part of the NOLS semester was a 10-day small group expedition. This was an opportunity for us to get into small groups of 4 or 5 and put all the skills we had developed over the course. We planned our own routes, prepared our own clothes and equipment, and _ our plans without the help of instructors. It was a great sense of achievement to be out there on our own and ensure safety with our own knowledge. I really enjoyed my first experience of my gap year!	['share his experiences in the NOLS']
What can we learn from the passage ?	"A group of swans flew down to a beach where a crow was jumping around . The crow watched them with disdain . ""You have no flying skills at all ! "" he said to the swans. "" All you can do is to move your wings. Can you turn over in the air ? No , that's beyond you. Let's have a flying compitition. I'll show you what real flying is ! "" One of the swans , a strong young male , took up the challenge. The crow flew up and began to show his skills. He flew in circles, performed other flying tricks, and then came down and looked proudly at the swan. Now it was the swan's turn. He flew up , and began flying over the sea. The crow flew after him , making all kinds of comments about his flying. They flew on and on till they couldn't see the land and there was nothing but water on all sides. The crow was making fewer and fewer comments. He was so _ that he found it hard to stay in the air, and had to struggle to keep himself from falling into the water. The swan pretended ( ) not to notice , and said, "" Why do you keep touching the water , brother ? Is that another trick ?"" "" No ,"" said the crow. He knew he had lost the competition. "" I'm in trouble because of my pride ! If you don't help me , I'll lose my life... "" The swan took pity on him , and took him on his shoulders and flew back to the beach. ,."

Which of the following is NOTincluded in Andreas Roehl's plan?	"Considered one of Europe's two ""bicycle capitals"" along with Amsterdam, Copenhagen counts more bicycles than people and cycling is so popular that its numerous bike paths can become crowded. Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade road used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. ""You have to elbow your way in to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,"" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell. The creation of bike highways ""comes right on time"", says Danish Cyclist Federation Spokesman Frits Bredal. ""Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,"" he says. ""If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycles have supposed that role today,"" Bredal says. ""It's a _ of transportation used by all social classes, even politicians ride bikes,"" he says. It is on crowded Noerrebrogade--the busiest bicycle street in Europe, according to the cyclist association--that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly roads. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four metres on either side of the road, which itself will be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade ""Europe's great cycling street"", says Andreas Roehl, Copenhagen government's bicycle program manager who is also known as ""Mr. Bike"". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner-city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to hike the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 37 percent it is today to 50 percent by 2015."	['All commuters will be pushed to leave their cars at home.']
Some birds in cities now choose to sing at night time because _ .	"Birds in cities are damaging their health by trying to sing above the noise of urban life. New research shows that male birds are trying to compete against traffic and city sounds.They are now singing louder and at higher frequencies,which could harm their vocal cords .Some birds are choosing to sing at night instead of during the day.This makes them more open to attack and also creates stress and exhaustion. ""The difference between urban and rural birdsong is becoming so big that the two groups could now be unable to communicate.This could lead to inbreeding and a weak gene poo1.""said Dr Sue Anne Zollinger of the.University of St Andrews. According to Zollingar,a bird group with a small gene pool might adapt less quickly to new diseases and could be wiped out. A study of the dawn chorus found that birds in Berlin sang up to 14 decibels louder than those in the forest.The birds sang loudest on weekday mornings. ""By trying to sing over the sound of the city,birds ale rising vocal injury,""said Zollinger.""All this puts the same strain on a bird's vocal cords as when a human need to shout to be heard--except that the birds are doing it all day,every day,""she said. ""Singing under such pressure means birds have less control over the sound they produce.Their songs may lose quality and become more rough--sounding.""said Zollinger.This could make them appear less attractive to female birds. Mark Constantine,author of The Sound Approach to Birding,said:""Birdsong is important for our quality of life and has been proved to reduce our blood pressure.When we live in the centre of large,urban areas,we get stressed and it's extremely good to have birdsong around us.The impact on humans of birdsong is massive.It harms us,as well as the birds,if their songs become louder and simpler."

Which is TRUE according to the passage?	Look at the picture. Who is the girl? She is my friend. Her name is Alice Black. She is an English girl. Alice has a big family. Her grandparents have two daughters and one son -- her father. Alice lives with her grandparents, parents, two brothers and one sister. Alice has two dogs -- Bobby and Tony. Bobby is black and Tony is white. Alice likes them very much. Alice is a middle school student. She has a good friend at school. Her name is Helen. They are cousins, too.	['Alice has two aunts.']
From the passage, we know that _ .	Older fathers have uglier children, researchers have claimed after linking age to genetic mutations . The finding comes weeks after leading scientists reported children born to men over the age of 45 run a higher risk of having autism and mental disorders. With age, sperm -producing cells do not copy a man's DNA as effectively, leading to genetic mutations. Martin Fielder, an anthropologist at Vienna University, told the Sunday Times: 'Every 16 years the mutation rate doubles. Other researchers found 25 mutations per sperm in a 20-year-old, but at age 40 it is 65 mutations. By 56, it doubles again. The effect is very visible - someone born to a father of 22 is already 5-10 per cent more attractive than those with a 40-year-old father and the difference grows with the age gap. In contrast, women pass on a maximum of 15 mutations to their baby, regardless of age, according to the study published in the journal Nature. Surveying a group of six men and six women, researchers showed them each 4,018 photographs of 18-20-year-old men and 4,416 of women the same age, and asked to assess their attractiveness. Those with older fathers were consistently considered less attractive. However, the children of older men, though less attractive, are likely to outlive their peers with younger fathers, it is claimed. Professor Lee Smith, a geneticist at Edinburgh University, told the Sunday Times other research found such children have longer telomeres - the caps on the end of chromosomes --- which are associated with longer life. But the mounting research connecting parents' age with autism is cause for concern, experts warn. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone's ability to interact socially and communicate openly. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Researchers said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal decision-making when it came to having fathering children at older ages. They warned that advancing paternal age faced a risk of 'numerous public health and societal problems'. Among well-known older dads are Simon Cowell, 54, whose son was born earlier this month, and comedian Frank Skinner whose first child was born in 2012 when he was 55.

Nearly all the parents _ while they went past the musician.	On a cold morning at a bus station, a man played six famous pieces of music for about an hour. During that time, about two thousand people went through the station, most of them were on their way to work. 3 minutes later: a middle-aged man noticed there was a musician playing. He slowed down, stopped for a few seconds and went away. 4 minutes later: the musician received his first dollar. A woman threw the money in the box and kept on walking without stopping. 6 minutes later: a young man stopped to listen to him. Then he looked at his watch and started to walk again. 10 minutes later: a 3-year-old boy stopped to look at the musician, but his mother took him away. Several other children did the same as the boy. And nearly all the parents took their children away. 45 minutes later: the musician kept on playing. Only 6 people stopped and stayed for a while. About 20 persons gave him money but left quickly. After 1 hour, the musician finished playing. In the end, he collected $ 32. No one noticed that he had finished playing. No one knew this, but the musician was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the world. At that time, he played one of the most wonderful pieces ever written, with a very expensive violin. If we do not have time to stop and listen to one of the best musicians in the world playing with the most beautiful violin, how many other things are we missing?	['took their children away']
The purpose of writing this text is to tell us how to _ .	"Can you become a creative person? Can you learn to come up with great ideas or learn to create new things? The answer is yes. The first step to becoming creative is to remove the words ""I am not creative"" from your vocabulary. Seriously, do not say them or do not say them even inside your head. Now you need to start looking what other people are doing. The more you see what they are doing, the more you can get a feel for how they think, and how they come up with creative ideas. Find a way or a place where you feel totally relaxed. This is important so you can let your mind come up with ideas. Write them down as you get them. For me a relaxing place is outside in nature where it is quiet and sunny, or when I take a long drive in my car by myself. The last step is to write down a few ideas every day. Repeat the process of reading and observing what similar people are doing and how they are being creative, finding a relaxing place to write down your thoughts, and writing down a few ideas every day until you start seeing this kind of results you are happy with. It may take a few weeks to a few months, but this is the training process you need to put your mind through to become creative. Remember, looking at things from different angle can also make a big difference to creativity. Question the way that everyone else is doing something using the same method and see if being different and doing it another way will produce something cool."	['learn to be creative']
How often do I go to a gym?	"Last month I had a health problem and had to see a doctor. After examining me, The doctor said to me, ""The result isn't too bad ."" But you must excise often and have healthy food every day. In fact, I'm a lazy person. I never get up early to exercise. And I often have junk food because I like it. In order to be healthy, I decided to change my lifestyle. Now I get up at 6:00 am every day. Then I go out to run for about an hour. I go to a gym on Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. And I hardly have junk food. I have healthy food, like milk and fish. I often eat vegetables and I have an apple every day. You know, "" An apple a day keeps the doctor away "" I also have about eight glasses of water. And I usually go to bed by ten. All these things make me healthy."	['Twice a week.']
According to the survey,in a middle school if a class has 40 students, about _ smoke.	"Students Begin to Smoke at a Younger Age SHANGHAI---- Almost one in four students aged between 12 and 14 have tried smoking, according to the results of a survey from the CATC . "" Quite a number of boy students in my class smoke outside the school yard during lunch break,"" said Li Xiaolan, an English teacher from a high school in Shanghai. The survey also found that 39 percent of students took their first cigarette from their classmates. "" It was quite common to smoke with my classmates at school,""said Zhou Guangrong,a 22- year-old university student from Guiyang, Guizhou province,who started smoking at the age of 12. Most of the student smokers buy cigarettes themselves."" My middle and high schools were surrounded by cigarette shops when I was a student,"" said Liu Minghui who used to smoke two cigarettes per day in primary school and two packs per week in middle and high school. "" We're keen to show that more teenagers are starting smoking much younger than before,and that we need to minimize the number of young smokers,"" said Duan Jiali, an officer in CATC. He added that teachers and parents should set a good example for teenagers by not smoking in front of them at school or at home, which is the best way of stopping teenagers from smoking."	['10']
The passage suggests that _ .	"Autumn and winter are cold and flu seasons. Will the old advice about dressing warmly help prevent a cold, or if you get sick, should you follow the old saying, ""feed a cold and starve a fever?"" And what about that fever? Should you take medicine to reduce your temperature, or is it better to let the body treat the fever itself? Everyone seems to have an answer. But is popular wisdom valuable? Doctor Nelson knows a lot about cold and flu seasons. Nelson says research may be just starting to provide proofs for long-held beliefs. For example, scientists for years were against the idea that getting cold and wet might cause colds or flu. But recent studies have shown that cold temperatures cause stress on the body, and that stress can create conditions more inviting to viruses. So maybe it does make sense to wrap up warmly before going outside. And what about feeding a cold and starving a fever? Nelson says if you have a cold and are hungry, you should eat. But a fever, especially a high one, suggests a more serious problem. He says people are usually not hungry when they have a high fever. Eating might even make a person sick. But drinking enough water is important. A fever easily makes the body lose water. Finally, when should you treat a fever? Nelson says a fever should be treated if it stays at 40degC or above for a day or more. A high temperature can damage brain cells. The doctor also believes in treating a fever if it prevents a person from sleeping. Medicine like aspirin, for example, can be used to reduce pain and fever. But aspirin should not be given to children because it can cause serious problems."	['it is easier for people to catch colds when their bodies are stressed.']
What have the Researchers discovered?	"Elderly adults who regularly drink green tea may stay more agile and independent than their peers over time, according to a Japanese study that covered thousands of people. Green tea contains antioxidant chemicals that may help stop the cell damage that can lead to disease. Researchers have been studying green tea's effect on everything from cholesterol to the risk of certain cancers, with mixed results so far. They found those who drank the most green tea were the least likely to develop ""functional disability"", or problems with daily activities or basic needs, such as dressing or bathing. Specifically, almost 13 percent of adults who drank less than a cup of green tea per day became functionally disabled, compared with just over 7 percent of people who drank at least five cups a day. The study did not prove that green tea alone kept people agile as they grew older. Green-tea lovers generally had healthier diets, including more fish, vegetables and fruit, as well as more education, lower smoking rates, fewer heart attacks and strokes, and greater mental sharpness. They also tended to be more socially active and have more friends and family to rely on. But even with those factors accounted for, green tea itself was tied to a lower disability risk, the researchers said. People who drank at least five cups a day were one-third less likely to develop disabilities than those who had less than a cup per day. Those people who averaged three or four cups a day had a 25 percent lower risk. Although it's not clear how green tea might offer a buffer against disability, Tomata's team did note that one recent study found green tea extracts seem to increase leg muscle strength in older women. While green tea and its extracts are considered safe in small amounts, they do contain caffeine and small amounts of vitamin K, which means it could affect drugs that prevent blood clotting ."

The passage is most probably taken from a(n) _ .	"The cost of college textbooks has risen sharply from 2002 to 2014. As a result, students have to look for other less expensive options , such as renting books. Now, they find another way, that is, using textbooks on the Internet, uploaded by other students. It is hard to know how popular this practice will be, but many college students around the country are uploading their expensive college textbooks onto the Internet, so that other students can download them for free and avoid the big fees. A year ago, a student wrote a blog called Children of the Stars about a professor who insisted that students buy the newest edition of a specific sociology book for more than $200 and didn't allow them to purchase an older paperback edition of the same book for $5. The student wrote, ""The newest edition of the book is so expensive. Fortunately, we found the electronic one online, which is very cheap. This is why we downloaded. "" The blog is followed by a list of websites where people can download books. Curious about how varied the selection of books was and how easy it was to download them, Vocativ.com decided to do an experiment. The workers of it picked five typical and important courses of freshmen and tried downloading all these textbooks on the websites offered by the student who wrote Children of the Stars. They typed the titles of these textbooks into a computer, and found them immediately. Within minutes, they had four textbooks on their hard drive. It is illegal to upload or download copyrighted materials without permission, but students still do it due to its advantages. Besides, schools haven't taken action to stop it."	['education report']
Some educational experts believe a mastery of English should include the ability _ .	"What is a good education? The question is far from being answered. Once more, colleges and universities are changing their programs: they _ ""fun courses"" and restart some of the traditional subjects neglected since the 1960s. Many great schools are again requiring the students to take a number of classes in English, history, literature, the social sciences, philosophy, the natural sciences, and art if they want to get a degree. Meanwhile, the experts are trying to describe the good education of our time. Obviously the purely vocational training once favored is not enough. But neither is the gentleman's education of the nineteenth century. Educational programs must meet the demands of a modern world where men and women have to work and to deal with big problems. What, then, is a good education of this century? Some educators suggest that it should include foreign languages and the study of foreign cultures; a mastery of English, including the ability to write and speak well, because communications have become all-important in the modern world, and also because ""a person who doesn't speak and write clearly doesn't reason clearly either""; some knowledge of the social sciences (sociology, psychology) that deal with human relations and human problems; some basic knowledge of modern science, which would enable future voters to be better informed about current problems like nuclear. Finally, many educators insist that all college graduates should be familiar with computers and modern information system since the educated professionals of tomorrow will have to understand their machines. Is that all? ""No, of course not."" answer the educators. ""We have not mentioned the two great building blocks of education: history and literature!"""	['to write and speak well']
What suggestion does David Bond give us?	"What do you remember about your childhood? I have good memories of exploring the fields near my house and riding my bike around the park. Today, children don't spend enough time in the fresh air. Many of them fix their eyes on a screen either on a computer, or a TV ---they seem to be living in a _ world. They have lost touch with nature. Now 400 organizations in the UK are encouraging children to have some ""wild time"". They want kids to exchange at least 30 minutes of watching TV or playing computer games for time playing outside. The simple pleasures of exploring and discovering nature help children to learn and keep fit too. Andy Simpson, who is part of the campaign , says: ""An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors."" Even if the kids live in a city, they can go on adventures in the garden or the park. However, children often need a helping hand from Mum and Dad. They need to be shown what to do and where to go. So despite the complex world that young people grow up in now, it seems that going back to basics and experiencing ""nature's playground "" is what modern children need. Andy Simpson adds: ""We want parents to see what this magical ""playground"" does for their kids' development , independence and creativity , by giving wild time a go "" . David Bond from Project Wild Thing says, ""We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted.

Why is Google mentioned in the passage?	"Have you ever felt you were being watched? Some new technologies might make you feel that way. Digital billboards are being created with ability to recognize certain characteristics. These high-tech devices have cameras pointed at the people on the street, and software that tries to recognize people by age and gender. A computer inside the billboard then uses the information to display ads that are directed at the people who are looking at the billboard. For example, if a man passes a billboard featuring an ad for cosmetics, the computer can change the ad to something that is more likely to catch the man's attention, such as football games. While advertisers see this as a great opportunity to reach their target customers, some people feel that this kind of profiling is an invasion of their privacy. People are now much more aware of how information is exposed, shared, bought, and sold on the Internet. Now this debate will involve technologies such as ""smart"" billboards. But advertisers claim that they are sensitive to people's concerns about privacy--companies that have tested the billboards in Japan and the U.S. assure consumers that the billboards can only guess your age and gender, but they will not be able to recognize your face or obtain any personal information about you. Until recently, this kind of personal advertising has been mostly limited to the Internet. Search engines like Google and Bing can follow what we search for because each computer that connects to those sites has a unique identity. Companies then pay search engines to use this information to display ads for products and services that you have searched for. So if you search for travel information, you are likely to see ads for airlines and hotels. This kind of advertising has proven to be much more effective--and valuable--than traditional advertising. In addition to taking steps to deliver more personalized messages, advertisers are using billboards to offer more useful information. Digital billboards can connect to the Internet to display information such as the time, weather, and news headlines. In the future, this technology could be used to relay immediate social events. In today's world, people ignore thousands of ads every day. Advertisers are trying to change that trend by personalizing the experience of seeing an ad. So pay attention: next time you see a billboard, it could be talking to you."	['It is an example of a search engine that sells information to companies.']
What is implied in the passage?	Hallmark arrived in my hometown of Calcutta, India when I was 16. On Valentine's Day , I waited in line with many other teenagers just for a chance to get into the store. I remember wishing two things. One of them is that the good-looking boy whom I could see through the store window was picking out a gift for me. Unfortunately, Valentine's Day passed and I received nothing but a lecture from my father on how Western capitalism was ruining your culture. The next Valentine's Day, I still didn't have a boyfriend, but I did receive a greeting card from a secret admirer. I can't remember what it exactly said inside the card, but it hardly mattered. I know I'm not the only one who's had the blues because of being single on Valentine's Day. It's not just on Valentine's Day that I'm reminded of these feelings. One night, my friend and I were at the subway station in New York City waiting for the local to arrive. The station was mostly full of college students, and later an older couple walked in. Just at that moment, a street musician started playing She's Only a Woman to Me. The couple began dancing around the station and lost in their own world. On the train, I found myself recalling the time when I was with a date at the subway station, and there he picked me up in his arms like I was a ballerina . My view of romance has changed from when I was 16 in Calcutta to now, 23, and living in Manhattan. This year, I won't focus all my romantic expectations on one particular day.

Which of the following is the best title for this passage?	"Homosexual couples in New York are being married for the first time after Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a law permitting same-sex marriage in the state last month. But such marriages, though now legal in New York, remain controversial . So many couples wanted to be married on Sunday, the first day of legal homosexual marriage in New York City, that local officials announced a lottery to determine qualification. New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, herself openly gay, witnessed the first two ceremonies of same-sex marriage. She says the same-sex marriage law supports equality. ""A law that says every family is as good as every other family; that every family is based on love, and is exactly the way God wants it to be,"" she said. Margie Phelps announced same-sex marriage as a crime against God. She and other Christians from the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas came halfway across the country to say marriage is defined by Holy Bible. ""The pattern is one man and one woman for life to have children who you raise in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,"" she said. David Schwartz, a traditional Jew, believes every human being has free choice and the power to rule over their desires. He considers homosexual desire to be wrong. ""There's one God in heaven and earth, and he has ordered for all mankind that they should limit their affections to relationships between a man and a woman in the context of marriage,"" he said. Douglas Robinson and his partner of 25 years, Michael Elsasser, were in the first group to be married in Manhattan. Robinson says the United States allows religious views to coexist with(...) what he believes is a civil right of same-sex marriage. ""You can have different opinions. This is a tent, some people call it a mixture of various different cultures and opinions and the like, so God bless America, and we are proud to be Americans,"" he said. Margie Phelps believes God will punish New York City for permitting what she believes to be moral decay. Meanwhile, Nevin Cohen and Daniel Hernandez showed off their marriage certificate. But they said they will not be going on a honeymoon. They say they need to be at work in New York on Monday."	['First Gay Marriage Legalized in New York']
"Mrs Chen wanted to buy a new dress. Her husband suggested that she buy it from a shop near their home. Mrs Chen disagreed because she had been cheated by that shop.

Sometimes it is helpful if you know what common proverbs mean. Here are a few examples: Once bitten, twice shy. If a dog bites me, I shall be twice as careful in future when I see it. This proverb is also used to apply to many things and not only to dogs. If you have been cheated at a shop, you will not go to the same shop again. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. If I am a hunter, trying to catch birds, it is better to catch one bird than to see two birds in a bush but not be able to catch them. Thus this means that what you have already got is better than the chance of being able to get something bigger in the future. Too many cooks spoil the broth(soup). When too many people do something together, they get in each other's way and cannot do a good job. To pour oil on troubled waters Is to try to calm things down. Oil is lighter than water.

He is sitting on a fence between two opposing sides, perhaps waiting to see which side will win. He who pays the piper calls the tune. A piper is a musician . The man who employs or pays a musician can say what tunes the man will play. Thus this means that if a man provides the money for a plan, he can say how it will be carried out.

From the passage we can infer that they might _ next.	"Hercule Poirot looked over the small gate which gave admission to Pine Crest. It was a modern nicely-built house. It was on a hill top, and the hill top was planted with a few sparse pines. It had a small neat garden and a large elderly man was watering with a big tin. Spence's hair was now grey all over. He had not shrunk much in girth , though. He stopped watering and looked at the visitor at the gate. Hercule Poirot stood there without moving. ""God bless my soul,"" said Spence. ""It must be. It can't be but it is. Yes, it must be Hercule Poirot!"" ""Aha,"" said Poirot, ""you remember me. I'm grateful."" Spence abandoned the watering can and came down to the gate. ""What brings you down here?"" ""What has brought me to many places in my time,"" said Poirot, ""and what once a good many years ago brought you to see me. Murder, Spence."" ""I'm done with murder since I retired,"" said Spence, ""except in the case of weeds. Killing weeds is never easy as you think, something's always wrong. How did you know where to find me?"" he asked as he opened the gate and Poirot passed through. ""You sent me a Christmas card. It had your new address on it."" ""Ah yes, so I did. I'm old-fashioned, you know, I like to send round cards at Christmas time to a few old friends. I'm an old man now."" ""We both are."" ""Not much grey in your hair,"" said Spence. ""I take care of my hair with a bottle,"" said Poirot. ""There is no need to appear in public with grey hair unless you wish to do so. By the way, why have you come to live in Woodleigh Common?"" ""As a matter of fact, I came here to join forces with a sister of mine. She lost her husband, her children are married and living abroad. So I moved in here. Pensions don't go far nowadays, but we do comfortably living together."""	['discuss about a murder']
According to the passage, Americans hold outdoor activities in _ .	"Outdoor picnics and parties are very popular in America in the summertime. Visit any park between Memorial Day (end of May) and Labor Day (beginning of September) and you'll find families and groups of friends enjoying the warm weather and sharing a meal. Birthday celebrations, family reunions, sporting events and holidays are all common reasons to host a get-together. But just wanting to be outside on a nice summer day is the best reason! Food is an important part of any gathering, and in the summer Americans love to cook outside on grills . All kinds of meats, such as hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken and sausages, and even vegetables like corn, peppers or potatoes can be cooked on the grill. Many typical families have grills in their yards, and many parks also have grills for public use. Men seem to particularly like to do the job of barbecuing the food, even if they don't usually cook at any other time. Many have ""secret recipes"" for a delicious barbecue sauce . Other guests at the party will often be asked to "" bring a dish to share"". This means that they will make some kind of side dish (a salad or vegetable) or dessert, and share it with the others. If you make something very delicious, people may want you to make it every time! Fried chicken and sandwiches are popular at picnics too, because you eat them with your hands. Potato salads and baked beans are favorite side dishes."	['June']

Why do you think the writer turned and walked back to the table?	I don't often lose things and I'm always careful with money, so I was quite surprised when I reached for my wallet and it wasn't there. At first, I thought it was possible that I could have left it at home. Then I remembered taking it out to pay the taxi, so I knew I had it with me just before I walked into the restaurant. I wondered if it was possible that it could have dropped out of my pocket while I was eating dinner. I turned and walked back to the table where I had been sitting. Unluckily, there were several people sitting at the table at that time, so I had the waiter go over to the table to see if my wallet was on the floor. While the waiter was looking for it, the head of the restaurant came up to me and asked me if anything was wrong. I told him what had happened. He asked me to report the missing wallet to the police. I told him I didn't want to do so; I was in a hurry because I had to reach my waiting room before two o'clock, where some people were waiting to see me. I also told him that my biggest worry at the moment was how I was going to pay for the meal. He told me not to worry about that. He asked me to write down my name and address, and he said he would send me a bill .	['He wondered if he had dropped his wallet while eating.']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"In some urban centers, workaholism is so common that people do not consider it unusual. They accept the lifestyle as normal. Government workers in Washington D. C, for example, frequently work sixty to seventy hours a week. They don't do this because they have to; they do it because they want to. Workaholicm can be a serious problem. Because true workaholics would rather work than do anything else, they probably don't know how to relax. Is workaholism always dangerous? Perhaps not. There are, certainly, people who work well under stress. Some studies show that many workaholics have great energy and interest in life. Their work is so pleasurable that they are actually very happy. For most workaholics, work and entertainment keep them busy and creative. Why do workaholics enjoy their jobs so much? There are several advantages to work. Of course, it provides people with paychecks, and this is important. But it offers more than financial security. It provides people with self confidence; they have a feeling of satisfaction when they're finishing a challenging piece of work and are able to say, ""I made that."" Psychologists claim that work gives people an identity through participation in work, they get a sense of self and individualism. In addition, most jobs provide people with a socially acceptable way to meet others. Perhaps some people are compulsive about their work, but their addiction seems to be a safe--even an advantageous-one."

Zuckerberg started Facebook from his Harvard dorm room on February 4, 2004. it quickly became a success at Harvard and more than two-thirds of the school's studetts signed up in the first two weeks. It started off as just a ""Havard-Thing,"" until Zuckerberg then decided to spread Facebook to other schools and enlisted the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They first spread it to Stanford, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cornell and Yale, and then to other schools with social contacts with Harvard. By the beginning of the summer, Zuckerberg and Moskovitz had made Facebook available at almost forty-five schools and hundreds of thousands of people were using it."	['Creative.']
Why does the parrot think Mr.Vinegar foolish?	"A long time ago, there lived a poor man whose real name has been forgotten. He was little and old and his face was wrinkled, and that was why his friends called him Mr. Vinegar. His wife was also little and old, and they lived in a little old cottage at the back of a little old field. ""John,"" said Mrs. Vinegar, ""you must go to town and buy a cow. I will milk her and churn butter and we shall never want for anything."" ""That is a good plan,"" said Mr. Vinegar, so he started off to town while his wife waited by the roadside. Mr. Vinegar walked up and down the street of the town looking for a cow. After a time, a farmer came that way, leading one that was very pretty and fat. ""Oh, if I only had that cow,"" said Mr. Vinegar, ""I would be the happiest man in the world!"" ""She's a very good cow,"" said the farmer. ""Well,"" said Mr. Vinegar, ""I'll give you these 50 gold pieces for her."" The farmer smiled and held out his hand for the money, ""You may have her,"" he said, ""I always like to oblige , my friends!"" Mr. Vinegar took hold of the cow's halter and led her up and down the street. ""I am the luckiest man in the world,"" he said, ""for only see how all the people are looking at me and my cow!"" But at one end of the street, he met a man playing bagpipes . He stopped and listened -- Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dee. ""Oh, that is the sweetest music I ever heard,"" he said, ""and just see how all the children crowd around the man and give him pennies! If I only had those bagpipes, I would be the happiest man in the world!!"" ""I'll sell them to you,"" said the piper. ""Will you? Well then, since I have no money, I will give you this cow for them."" ""You may have them,"" answered the piper, ""I always like to oblige a friend."" Mr. Vinegar took the bagpipes and the piper led the cow away. ""Now we will have some music,"" said Mr. Vinegar, but try as hard as he might, he could not play a tune. He could get nothing out of the bagpipes but ""squeak, squeak"". The children instead of giving him pennies laughed at him. The day was chilly and in trying to play the pipes, his fingers grew very cold. He wished he had kept the cow. He just started for home when he met a man who had warm gloves on his hands. ""Oh, if I only had those pretty gloves,"" he said, ""I would be the happiest man in the world."" ""How much will you give for them?"" asked the man. ""Oh, I have no money, but I will give you these bagpipes,"" answered Mr. Vinegar. ""Well,"" said the man, ""you may have them for I always like to oblige a friend."" Mr. Vinegar gave him the bagpipes and drew the gloves on over his half frozen fingers. ""How lucky I am,"" he said as he trudged homeward. His hands were soon quite warm, but the road was rough and the walking hard. He was very tired when he came to the foot of the steep hill. ""How shall I ever get to the top?"" he said. Just then he met a man who was walking the other way. He had a stick in his hand which he used as a cane to help him along. ""My friend,"" said Mr. Vinegar, ""if only I had that stick of yours to help me up this hill, I would be the happiest man in the world!"" ""How much will you give me for it?"" asked the man. ""Well, I have no money, but I will give you this pair of warm gloves,"" said Mr. Vinegar. ""Well,"" said the man, ""you may have it for I always like to oblige a friend."" Mr. Vinegar's hands were now quite warm, so he gave the gloves to the man and took the stout stick to help him along. ""How lucky I am!'' he said as he toiled upward. At the top of the hill he stopped to rest. But as he was thinking of all his good luck that day, he heard someone calling his name. He looked up and saw only a green parrot sitting in a tree. ""Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar,"" it cried. ""What now?"" said Mr. Vinegar. ""You're a dunce , you're a dunce!'' answered the bird, ""you went to seek your _ and you found it, then you gave it for a cow, and the cow for some bagpipes, and the bagpipes for some gloves, and the gloves for a stick which you might of cut by the roadside. He He He, you're a dunce! You're a dunce!'' This made Mr. Vinegar very angry. He threw the stick at the bird with all his might. But the bird only answered, ""You're a dunce! You're a dunce!"" And the stick lodged in the tree where he could not get it again. Mr. Vinegar went on slowly for he had many things to think about. His wife was standing by the roadside and as soon as she saw him, she cried out, ""Where's the cow? Where's the cow?"" ""Well, I just don't know where the cow is,"" said Mr. Vinegar. And then he told her the whole story."	['Because Mr.Vinegar gave his fortune for nothing']
Which is the best title of this passage?	Dear World, My son starts school today. It's going to be strange and new to him for some time. And I wish you would treat him gently. You see, up to now, he has been king of his own room. He has been boss of the backyard. I have always been around to treat his wounds, and to comfort his feelings. But now things are going to be different. This morning, he's going to walk down the front steps, wave his hand and start his life. So, World, I wish you would take him by the little hand and teach him the things he will have to know. Teach him there are heroes, leaders and friends in this world. Give him quiet time to think over the mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on the green hill. Teach him to believe in his own ideas, even if everyone else tells him he is wrong. Teach him to stand and fight if he thinks he is right. Teach him never to put a price on his heart and spirit. Teach him gently, World, but don't love him too much, because only the test of fire makes fine steel. This is a big order, World, and see what you can do. He's such a little fellow.

Who give kids to have a chance to get education?	"Back in September of 2005, on the first day of school, Martha Cochran, a social studies school teacher at Robinson High School, did something unforgettable. On the first day of school, with permission of the school headmaster, she took all of the desks out of the classroom. The kids came into the first period. They walked in, and there were no desks. They looked around and said, ""Ms Cochran, where are our desks?"" And she said, ""You can't have a desk until you tell me how you earn them."" They thought, ""Well, maybe it's our grades."" ""No,"" she said. ""Maybe it's our behavior. "" And she told them, ""No, it's not even your behavior. "" Second period, the same thing. Third period... By early afternoon television news reporters had gathered in Ms. Cochran's class to find out about this crazy teacher. The last period of the day, Martha Cochran gathered her class. They were at this time sitting on the ground floor around the sides of the room. ""Throughout the day no one has really understood how you earn the ordinary desks in this classroom."" she said, ""Now I'm going to tell you. "" Martha Cochran went to the door of the classroom and opened it, and as she did, twenty-seven adults, who were fathers or mothers of the kids, walked into that classroom, each one having a school desk. And they placed those school desks in rows. And when they finished placing those desks, those kids for the first time in their lives understood how they earned those desks. Martha said, ""You don't have to earn those desks. They did it for you. They put them out there for you, but it's up to you to sit here responsibly to learn, to be good students and good citizens, because they paid a price for you to have that desk, and don't ever forget it!

Which is the TRUE according to the text?	Today, due to numerous medical and scientific advances, people are living longer than ever before. But you have to be good to your body, mind, and soul. The following tips are a good start for getting you on your way to living a long and healthy life. Eat a balanced diet -- one that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fiber and low in saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. A well-balanced diet can provide your body with the essential nutrients needed to achieve and maintain optimum health. Be physically active -- try to incorporate 30 minutes of activity into your day, every day. The options are endless; start walking on the beach in the mornings, try jogging with a friend, or go for a bike ride in the afternoons. Make sure you choose activities that you enjoy, that way you'll be more likely to make them a habit. Get regular preventive check-ups --see your doctor regularly; remember your doctor is your partner in health care. By having regular check-ups, you may be able to catch small problems before they become big ones. Be safe -- use common sense and be streetsmart . Don't put yourself in situations that are questionable. Always wear your seatbelt and bike helmet. Don't go for a run, walk, or jog at night by yourself. Keep your home well lit and free of things that could make you fall. Stay in touch with family and friends -- get to know your neighbors. Take the time to be involved with your community. By creating a strong social network, you will not only have friends to celebrate with when good things happen, but also a support system in difficult times. Keep a positive attitude -- studies have shown that people who have a positive attitude tend to live longer, and lead healthier and happier lives. Try to find the humor in life. And remember to laugh.	['Regular check-ups can prevent serious illnesses at the very beginning.']
For whom is the passage written?	When people talk of a virus these days, chances are that they are talking about computer virus that have the power wipe out all the valuable work people may have stored in their computers. Imagine, the virus has the power to make military systems, giant banks, airports, hospitals and traffic system come to stop! What does a computer virus do? It targets electronic objects that are programmed. The virus spreads through connections between these electronic objects. For virus spreading experts, e-mail is a favorite method of sending their destructive weapon. But scientists warn that this is not the worst that can happen. There is more. People are also connected through phones. The next virus may actually target mobile phones, especially those that are programmed to do many tasks apart from just communicating. It would then be easy for a virus to infect those programs and create major disorder. For example, these virus may have the power to record your phone conversations and make others hear them. They create problems with your electronic money accounts, or they could create a mountain of telephone bills for calls you never made. And that would be a disaster. A report on this was published in the New Scientist recently. One way out would be to have simpler phones with not so many different functions. This would mean there would mean there would be fewer programs for the virus to attack. But mobile phone producers are _ . People on longer want an electronic item to perform just one task. They want more and more functions added. That would mean more software programs to make the mobile phone perform all those functions. And that means the possibility of more viruses.

Nowadays, if you come to a coffeehouse, you can _ .	Coffee has a history dating back to at least the 9th century and has been a catalyst for social interaction across cultures and eras. Originally discovered in Ethiopia, coffee beans were brought into the Middle East by Arab traders, spreading to Egypt, Yemen, Persia, Turkey, and North Africa by the 15th century. Muslim merchants eventually brought the beans to the thriving port city of Venice, where they sold them to wealthy Italian buyers. Soon, the Dutch began importing and growing coffee in places like Java and Ceylon (largely through slave labor), and the British East India Trading Company was popularizing the beverage in England. Coffee spread across Europe and even reached America. Where there has been coffee, there has been the coffeehouse. From the 15th century Middle Eastern establishments where men gathered to listen to music, play chess, and hear recitations from works of literature, to Paris' Cafe le Procope where luminaries of the French Enlightenment such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot came to enjoy a hot cup of joe, coffeehouses have traditionally served as centers of social interaction, places where people can come to relax, chat, and exchange ideas. The modern coffee shop is modeled on the espresso and pastry-centered Italian coffeehouses that arose with the establishment of Italian-American immigrant communities in major US cities such as New York City's Little Italy and Greenwich Village, Boston's North End, and San Francisco's North Beach. New York coffee shops were often frequented by the Beats in the 1950's. It wasn't long before Seattle and other parts of the Pacific Northwest were developing coffee shops as part of a thriving counterculture scene. The Seattle-based Starbucks took this model and brought it into mainstream culture. Although coffeehouses today continue to serve their traditional purpose as lively social hubs in many communities, they have noticeably adapted to the times. Rediscovering their purpose as centers of information exchange and communication, many coffee shops now provide their customers with internet access and newspapers. It has become extremely common to see someone sitting at a Starbucks listening to music or surfing the web on his or her laptop. Coffee stores today also maintain a fairly identifiable, yet unique aesthetic: wooden furniture and plush couches, paintings and murals drawn on walls, and soft-lighting combine to give coffee shops the cozy feeling of a home away from home. Today, big business retail coffee shops are expanding quickly all over the world. Starbucks alone has stores in over 40 countries and plans to add more. Despite its popularity, Starbucks has been criticized and labeled by many as a blood-sucking corporate machine, driving smaller coffee shops out of business through unfair practices. This has even spawned an anti-corporate coffee counterculture, with those subscribing to this culture boycotting big business coffee chains. Increasingly popular coffee stores such as The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf are also giving Starbucks some stiff competition. In any case, it seems pretty clear that coffee has weaved itself into the fabric of our consumer-oriented culture.	['surf the internet']
Zhang Qian feels lucky because _ .	"The weekend is usually a period of time for resting. But today's Chinese students can hardly rest during the weekend. According to a survey, 25%of the Grade 8 students in Beijing have classes on the weekend. Over 38% of the middle school students have less than eight hours' sleep, because of the hard study. Nan Weitong is a Grade7 student in Hubei. The girl has to get up at 6:30 am on Saturday. Then she has a whole day of classes. On Sunday, she has classes for math and English. She says her classmates all work very hard. However, some students are much luckier. They don't have to go to school on weekends. Zhang Qian, a Grade 9 student from Jinan, is one of them. On the weekend, she usually gets up at 8:00am. Then she spends some time on her homework. After that, she goes shopping or watches TV. Zhang Qian said her mother once wanted her to try extra classes. ""But my teacher said it was unnecessary. Learning well at school is enough,"" Zhang Qian said, ""I feel pretty lucky."""	"[""she doesn't need to have extra classes""]"
What does Neel Mukherjee think of his difficult-to-write characters?	"Characters in novels don't always do what the writer wants them to do. Sometimes they cause trouble, take on lives of their own, or even work against the writer. It's not just a problem for inexperienced authors: famed children's novelist Roald Dahl said he got the main character in his bookMatildaso ""wrong""that when he'd finished his first version, he threw it away and started again. Of course it's not the characters' fault. The problem lies with the author. Take Stephen King, who admitted that writing working-class characters is more difficult nowadays because his own circumstances have changed. ""It is definitely harder,""King said.""When I wroteCarriemany years ago, I was one step away from physical labour."" This is also true for characters' ages, added King.""When you have small children, it is easy to write young characters because you observe them and you have them in your life all the time. But your kids grow up, it's been harder for me to write about this little 12-year-old girl in my new book because my models are gone."" For other authors, such as Karen Fowler, there's one quality that can stop a character in its tracks: boredom.""I had particular problems with the main character in my historical novelSister Noon,""she says.""She had attitudes about race and religion that seemed appropriate to me for her time and class, but they were not attitudes I liked. Eventually I grew quite bored with her. You can write a book about a character you dislike or a character you disagree with, but I don't think you can write a book about a character who bores you."" According to Neel Mukherjee, it was Adinath, a character inThe Lives of Others, who made him work the hardest.""I think I struggled because it's difficult to write a character whose most prominent personal feature is weakness, as Adinath's is, without making that feature define him,""Mukherjee says. But a troublesome character is far from an unwelcome guest, he continues, arguing that ""when characters work against the author they come alive and become unpredictable"". ""That is a fantastic thing to happen,""Mukherjee says.""I celebrate it. It is one of the great, lucky gifts given to a writer."""	['They are often the most interesting.']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	Geography is the study of Earth and its climates. Scientists use it to study global warming and track the weather. Governments use it to learn where people live and work and to plan what to do with the land. It is now easier than ever to use geography because of a science called space technology. The United States launched its first satellite in 1958. Some space missions that followed were geographical studies. In fact, earth science is a big part of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Astronauts looked out of the space shuttle. They decided to take photographs of Earth from their vantage point. Over the years, picture quality improved. Shuttle photography now shows land features, such as rivers. It can even show the streets of large cities. Photos of the same places at different times show how the land is changing. NASA does not use just photographs, though. In 1958 it launched TIROS (the Television Infrared Observation Satellite). This first use of a satellite to study Earth was effective in giving weather forecasts. It led to the creation of new space tools to use in geography. The Landsat Program began in 1972. This satellite sent detailed views of Earth from space. The pictures were so precise that scientists could count the number and kinds of crops in a field. Landsat showed where Earth's surface had faults along which earthquakes might happen. This information helped in the planning of new cities and factories. Landsat also made discoveries. In Antarctica it located ranges of unknown mountains. It pinpointed small lakes in Virginia that were no ton maps. Landsat, now more advanced, still flies today. Another space tool is Earth Observing-1 (EO-1). This spacecraft flies right behind Landsat. It takes pictures of the same sites. The two sets of pictures, viewed together, show how cities grow and how other places, such as rain forests, become smaller over time. This helps scientists learn how people affect geography. One of the newest space tools is the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is computer software that helps scientists to study Earth. GIS is different from earlier space tools. Businesses, schools, and even average people -- not just the government --can use it to show them how changes in the planet might affect them.

Which of the following statements is RIGHT?	"Did you know that Albert Einstein could not speak until he was four years old, and did not read until he was seven? His parents and teachers worried about his rnenta1ability. Beethoven's music teacher said about him,""As a composer he is hopeless."" What if this young boy believed it? When Thomas Edison was a young boy,his teachers said he was so stupid that he could never learn anything.He once said,''I remember I used to never be able to get along at schoo1.I was always at the foot of my class...My father thought I was stupid,and I almost decided that l was a stupid person.""What if young Thomas believed what may said about him? When the sculptor Auguste Rodin was young; he had difficulty learning to read and write.:. Today, we may say he had a learning disability. His father said of him, ""I have an idiot for a son. ""His uncle agreed. ""He's uneducable,"" he said. What if Rodin had doubted his ability? Walt Disney was once fired by a newspaper editor because he was thought to have no ""good ideas"". Enrico Caruso was told by one music teacher, ""you can't sing. You have no voice at all. "" And an editor told Louisa May Alcott that she was unable to write anything that would have popular appeal. What if these people had listened and become discouraged? Where would our world be without the music of Beethoven, the art of Rodin or the ideas of Albert Einstein and Walt Disney? As Oscar Levant once said, ""It's not what you are but what you don't become that hurts. "" You have great potential.When you believe in all you can be, rather than all you cannot become, you will find your place on earth."

What can be learned from the passage?	"Guinness World Records, the global authority on record-breaking achievements, presented China Central TV (CCTV) the world record for Most Watched National Network TV Broadcast for its annual Spring Festival Gala show. The program, which is produced especially to celebratethe Chinese New Year, had a unique reach of 498,659,000 viewers on CCTV-1, 3 and 4 in 2012 , making it the most watched national variety entertainment show in the world. The official record certificate was presented by Guinness World Records, Global Managing Director, Mr. Alistair Richards to CCTV Vice President Mr. Luo Ming during a special ""China in Cannes"" reception co-hosted with Reed MIDEM as part of the celebrations to honor the Chinese delegation at this year's MIPTV market. CSM Media Research, which supplied the viewing figures for Guinness World Records verification , considered viewers aged 4 years or above who watched at least one minute of the 2012 show on either CCTV-1, 3 or 4, the three channels which aired the show at the same time. The figure refers to viewers on any one of the three channels, therefore excluding duplications . This represents almost 40% of the China TV population aged 4 years or above. Commenting on CCTV's incredible record achievement which is based on reach of audience, Alistair Richards said, ""It is fitting that we celebratethis amazing achievement at MIPTV. National networks have the power to move nations and CCTV's Spring Festival Gala is the ultimate example. It reaches nearly half a billion people on the biggest holiday of their year."" CCTV Vice President Luo Ming, who accepted the Guinness World Records certificate on behalf of CCTV, said, ""Chinese New Year is a special time for families in China and our Spring Festival Gala has been the traditional TV entertainment highlight for three decades. Although this is a world record achieved by our viewers, it is also a record won by the staff of CCTV, who makes it possible for our television shows to reach homes right across China.""

Which one of the following is NOT right according to this passage?	For thousands of years humans have used herbs , roots, and other things from nature to cure disease. Scientists looking for new cures often visit traditional healers. They find out what plants are used in healing. Then they look at what the plant contains. They find the active ingredient , which is the chemical in the plant that works to heal. Many of the drugs we use, including aspirin, have come from these natural medicines. In recent years, many people in the US have taking what are legally known as dietary supplements . They may be vitamins or minerals. They may be herbs that help with health problems, such as depression. Some of them are teas. Others are capsules or tablets. They are sold in natural food stores, drug stores, and groceries. Most people think that because these products are natural they are also safe. This is not always true. There are many plants that are poisonous. There are others that have bad side effects. The New England Journal of Medicine publishes medical research. A recent edition called for the government to _ dietary supplements. Several doctors wrote to the Journal and told of bad experiences people have had with dietary supplements. Dietary supplements aren't tested in the same way as drugs. There is not always proof that the supplement really does what it is supposed to do. There is also a problem with purity of the supplements. Supplements have been found to contain things that are bad for the body. For example, the California Department of Health found that of 260 herbs grown in China, one third contained heavy metals. These are minerals such as lead and mercury . They are very poisonous, even in tiny amounts.	['It is right that the dietary supplements are always safe.']
The cat rescued the author by _ .	When my father was dying, I traveled a thousand miles from home to be with him in his last days. It was far more heartbreaking than I'd expected, one of the most difficult and painful times in my life. After he passed away I stayed alone in his apartment. There were so many things to deal with. It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. But one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep. The next morning I checked with neighbors and learned that the cat had been abandoned by his owner who's moved out. So the little cat was there all alone, just like I was. As I walked back to the apartment, I tried to figure out what to do with him. Having something else to take care of seemed _ But as soon as I opened the apartment door he came running and jumped into my arms. It was clear from that moment that he had no intention of going anywhere. I started calling him Willis, in honor of my father's best friend. From then on, things grew easier. With Willis in my lap time seemed to pass much more quickly. When the time finally came for me to return home I had to decide what to do about Willis. There was absolutely no way I would leave without him. It's now been five years since my father died. Over the years, several people have commented on how nice it was of me to rescue the cat. But I know that we rescued each other. I may have given him a home but he gave me something greater.	['making her feel better in her hard times']
We can learn from the passage that Norman Cousins _ .	Laughter healing benefits and healing with laughter have become synonymous with Norman Cousins, the man who laughed himself to wellness. Norman Cousins was the editor of SaturdayReviewfor over 30 years. His story began in 1964, when doctors found that the connective tissue in his spine was becoming worse, which is a condition known as Ankylosing Spondylitis . The doctors, one of whom was a close friend of Cousins, said that his chance of survival was approximately 1 in 500. He read about the theory that negative emotions do harm to the body, so he thought that if negative emotions were damaging to health, then positive emotions should improve health. Faced with the real possibility of his approaching death, Cousins thought long and hard and eventually did three things completely contrary to medical opinion. First he began his own research on all of the various drugs he was on. He discovered that his condition was removing Vitamin C from his body and, based on Cousins' personal research, doctors agreed to take him off several of the drugs he was on and inject him with large doses of this supplement , as Cousins felt this may be his last hope. Secondly, Cousins made a decision to check out of the hospital and into a hotel room. The third thing Cousins did was get a movie projector and a large supply of funny films. On his first night in the hotel Cousins found that he laughed so hard at the films that he was able to stimulate chemicals in his body that allowed him several hours of pain-free sleep. When the pain returned he would simply turn the projector back on and the laughter would help sleep, and he was able to measure the changes in his body by measuring his blood sedimentation rate , and found that this rate dropped by at least 5 points each time he watched one of these videos. The treatment proved to be so effective that in very little time Cousins was off all painkillers and sleeping pills. He found that the laughter relieved the pain and helped him sleep. He returned to work and wrote about his experimental treatment in his book Anatomy of an Illness. In 1989, it was finally acknowledged in the Journal of the American Medical Association that laughter therapy could help improve the quality of life for patients with chronic illness and that laughter has an immediate symptom-relieving effect.

What the author wishes to make her girls do is to _ .	"Technology today has stolen away our voices and robbed our children of memories. I've been keeping count of how often people sing around the house these days. The fact is, they don't. My earliest memories are of my mother crooning lullabies in a gentle low voice as she rocked each infant in turn. She said she ""didn't have a singing voice,"" but her low, wavering alto will always mean comfort to me. Every time I have sat through the night with a feverish body or held a pre - schooler through a nightmare, the melodies returned, words appearing and disappearing like fragments of a dream but held together by the hum of love. Today, young mothers are routinely presented with lullaby tapes at the baby shower. When baby cries, the idea goes, they will be able to switch on the high-tech audio system and _ with the voices of strangers in his ears, perfectly on pitch. If I had my way, new parents would learn the songs themselves, throw out their stereos, and give their child the gift of their own sleepy voices through the midnight hours. These days, when we go on a trip, my daughters take along tiny personal stereos and headphones. They are lost in their private worlds, and I can't help wishing that at least here, in the car my girls would be forced to listen to their mother's voice again, sure I'm out-of-tune songs that they might then pass down to another generation. Those sophisticated earphones have robbed them of something I think every kid should carry from childhood car trips into adulthood. I drove away from that party humming, and all the way home the good old songs kept tumbling out. Damm it , I thought, why did I ever stop singing in the car and start turning on the radio ? Why don't I sing anymore while I'm doing the dishes? I'm going to pull those stereo wires right out of the wall when I get home. We're going to sing grace before meals, sing carols around the piano, sing in the shower instead of switching on that waterproof radio that stole away our voices and our souls."

Why did Banerjee design his invention?	"A 13-year-old American has made a cheap machine that can help blind people read. The blind can read by using _ - a system of small bumps that the blind touch to read the letters. The machine that makes these small bumps usually costs at least $2,000. It is called Braille writer. The American schoolboy, Shubham Banerjee, made a new Braille writer from a Lego tool that lets people create robots. Banerjee has called his new machine the Braigo - a combination of the words Braille and Lego. It costs just $ 350. It works by changing electronic text into Braille and then printing it using a computer or mobile machine. Banerjee designed his Braigo last year for a school science exhibition. Since then, he has caught the interest of Silicon Valley in the USA. The big technology company Intel spent money on Banerjee's machine last November, but they did not say how much money they put in. Banerjee also got $35, 000 from his father to help him start the project. His father works as a computer engineer at Intel. He spoke about why he gave so much money to his son, saying:""We as parents started to be interested more, thinking that he's on to something and this invention has to continue."" Banerjee told the AP News: ""My dream would probably be having most of the blind people...using my Braigo."""	['He did it for a school science project.']
If you want to have a good sleep, _ is helpful.	Enough sleep is important to health. The amount of sleep needed depends on the age of the person and the conditions in which sleep takes place. The young may need more sleep than the old, but usually eight hours are enough for the health of grown-ups. Some can do with less than this amount, but others may need more. Every person knows his own need. It is then a matter of good judgment to satisfy his need. Sleep should always be enough to make one bring back his strength and get ready for a day's work. Fresh air is necessary to sound sleep. It is not without reason for some people to think that it is practicable to sleep in the open air. When one can keep himself warm, out-of-door sleeping probably gives the body its most complete relaxation . Ability to sleep is largely a habit. The conditions referred to only lead to sleep. Out-of-door exercises, a good habit of regular hours and the avoidance of late eating and worry, which are largely within the control of any person, are all helpful to sound sleep. A bath at bedtime, neither hot nor cool but of body temperature, may be helpful to sleep. Sleep-producing drug should never be taken except when suggested by a doctor.	['keeping good habits.']
From the excerpts of the poem, we can learn _ .	Dear Basketball From the right moment I was crazy about you. A love so deep I gave you my all -- From my mind & body To my spi rit & soul . As a six-year-old boy Deeply in love with you I never saw the end of the tunnel. I only saw myself Running out of one. And so I ran. I ran up and down every playground I gave you my heart Because it came with so much more. I played through the sweat and hurt Not because challenge called me But because YOU called me. I did everything for YOU. You gave a six-year-old boy his dream And I'll always love you for it. Love you always. ......	['The writer began to practise a lot for his dream when he was a little boy']
Many Japanese students are unhappy at school because_.	Japanese students work very hard but many are very unhappy. They feel great pressure from their parents to do well in school and in college. Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have successful future. Although this may be good advice for those who are very bright, it can have very bad results for many students who are not quick enough at learning. Unfortunately, a number of students actually kill themselves. Others are after comfort in using drugs. Some students, however, do bad things with groups of bad people and turn to crime. Many of them have tried very hard at school but, in spite of all their tries, have failed in certain examinations and have disappointed their parents. Such students feel that they are less important than everyone else they meet and leave school before they finish their study. It is surprising that although most Japanese parents are anxious for their children to do well at school, they do not help them in any way. Many parents feel that they are unable to help their children with their lessons and that it is the teachers' job to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to special schools called juku-cram schools. These schools are open during the evenings and on weekends, and their only purpose is to prepare students to pass exams; they do not try to educate students in any real sense of the world. Thus comes a shock to realize that almost three quarters of the junior high school students attend these cram schools. Ordinary Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the length of students' hair to their clothes and things in their school bags. Child psychologists now think that such strict rules often lead to a feeling of being unsafe and being unable to fit into society. They believe that no sense of moral values is developed and that students are given neither guidance nor training in becoming good citizens.	['their parents put much pressure on them']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	The World Health Organization estimates that more than 4 million people die each year from the effects of smoking tobacco . That number is increasing. WHO officials expect 150 million people to die from tobacco use in the next twenty years. Seven in ten of those deaths will be in developing countries. These numbers are frightening. Yet people around the world continue to smoke. It is not easy to stop smoking. However, doctors say you will live longer if you do stop smoking. You will feel better and look better. You will also protect the health of family members who breathe in your smoke. The American Cancer Society says there is not just one right way to stop smoking. It says that one method or a unit of methods may be successful. These include attending self-help programs or following directions in a book. The group says any way to stop smoking that is legal, moral and effective is worth trying. This could include taking long walks or spending time in areas where smoking is not allowed. Also, you could eat a small piece of fruit instead of having a cigarette. The American Cancer Society says the sooner smokers stop smoking, the more they reduce their chances of getting cancer and other diseases. It says blood pressure returns to normal twenty minutes after a smoker smoking the last cigarette. Carbon monoxide (CO) gas levels in the blood return to normal after eight hours. In a day, the chances of a heart attack decrease. In a year, the risk of heart disease is half that of a smoker.	['the smoker can affect the health of his or her family members']
Which is the best title for the passage?	"Whether it's joining a school club, going to a friend's birthday party, or travelling by train, we can meet new people anywhere and anytime in our lives. However, many of us feel awkward when meeting people for the first time, especially when we aren't quite sure what to say. The situation feels cold, even icy. ""Breaking the ice"" is a term widely used in the English-speaking countries to describe a small talk technique that can help rescue a conversation from certain failure. So where do you even begin? Well, a good start is to accept that it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when talking to someone for the first time. They might look _ or scary, but they could turn out to be the nicest person you've ever met. You might think that breaking the ice is difficult. But sometimes just a simple ""hello"", followed by a three-second smile, can make all the difference. Complimenting someone on their garment or accessories is also a great, easy way to break the ice. You might say: ""I love your jacket. Where did you buy it from?"" Being in an uncomfortable or unpleasant situation with someone new might feel terrible, but it can actually be one of the best icebreakers. By focusing on the situation, you come together to fight the common enemy: the long bathroom queue, for example, or the overcrowded bus. You can make observations too. ""What kind of drink is that?"" ""That's a lovely name. What does it mean?"" ""Do you study here too?"" There are opportunities all around you to ask questions that don't seem weird, as long as you have some follow-up questions in mind. If you're feeling extra bold, make a joke. Jokes can be difficult to master but if you get them right, they show the likeable, witty side of your character. ""What's your name?"" ""Well, people usually call me Mike, but you can call me tonight."""	['Advice on breaking the ice when we communicate with a stranger']
What may be the best title for the text?	"Last night my husband and I were on the way to a show. We were both hungry and wanted to grab a quick bite on our way there, so we swung through a Jack-In-the-Box- Drive-thru Restaurant and placed our order. When we got up to the window the lady smiled at me, which is sometimes rare and asked how I was doing while she was collecting our money for the food. I replied, ""Fine, and how are you'?""She went to get our order ready and I asked my husband to pass my ""Drive-thru Smile bag"" to me. He handed it to me and watched in amazement as I gathered together a ""You make a difference"" paper, including a smile card, a smile stamp and a smile button. She came back to the window almost before I finished putting it all together. Without looking too closely she passed the bag and said, ""Thank you. Have a good day."" I said, ""Wait! This is for you."" As I placed the little smile gifts in her hand a smile spread across her face. As she looked at the items it got a little bigger but when I thanked her for her smile there was no holding back. She gave the biggest smile and she was laughing. It was very heartwarming. My husband was very impressed by it. It made him smile too. It just takes a little effort to connect in a human way to everyone we have dealings with, even with something as small as a Drive-thru transaction. Remember, we all make a difference!"

At the beginning the clocks had _ .	People began making clocks over 500 years ago. The first clocks had only one hand---the hour hand. At a later time the clocks had the minute hand. The first clocks were big and heavy. Some rich people had servants to carry the clocks when they were out. Time passed and clocks became smaller. Bells became a part of some large clocks in cities and towns. They were for people unable to see the clock. Some clocks were in large towers . Some of them are 400 or 500 years old now. Big Ben in London is a very famous tower clock. Now many people have alarm clocks to wake them up to go to work or go to school. So clocks are the very important part of people's life.	['one hand']

Who plant the community gardens?	Have you ever walked down a city street and suddenly seen a bright garden full of vegetables and flowers? It may be a community garden. The community gardens are planted by the people in the community. They are not just pretty places. They improve the neighborhoods. People first started planting these gardens during the 1970s. At that time, the price of vegetables and fruits was rising. In many city neighborhoods, crime was increasing. There were also many other problems. People decided to get together to plant gardens to fight against these problems. The gardeners thought they might make the area more beautiful and improve people's life. These gardeners were right! Community gardens have many benefits. They improve their neighbourhoods. They also make people feel they belong to the community. When people work together in a garden, they feel they are connected with each other. People work on a small area within the garden. They grow vegetables or fruits. Each person decides what he or she is going to grow. However, they also work together to help each other. Some members have gardening experience. They can help those who are just learning how to grow vegetables and fruits. Sometimes, garden members pay for supplies. The supplies usually include small plants and tools. Many community gardens have sponsors . They pay for the supplies for the gardens. It helps to keep the gardens going every year. Sponsors may be parks, schools and local companies. Some groups want to be a part of the community. They help clean up and beautify a neighborhood. They also pay for the supplies. Community gardens give people a chance to work together.

The author was _ when he wrote this article.	"One of the qualities that most people admire in others is the willingness to admit one's mistakes. It is extremely hard sometimes to say a simple thing like ""I was wrong about that, ""and it is even harder to say, ""I was wrong, and you were right about that. "" I had an experience recently with someone admitting to me that he had made a mistake fifteen years ago. He told me he had been the manager of a certain grocery store in the neighborhood where I grew up, and he asked me if I remembered the egg cartons . Then he related an incident and I began to remember clearly the incident he was describing. I was about eight years old at the time, and I had gone into the store with my mother to do the weekly grocery shopping. On that particular day, I must have found my way to the dairy food department where the incident took place. There must have been a special sale on eggs that day because there was an impressive display of eggs in dozen and half-dozen cartons. The cartons were stacked three or four feet high. I must have stopped in front of a display to admire the stacks. Just then a woman came by pushing her grocery cart and knocked off the stacks of cartons. For some reason, I decided it was up to me to put the display back together, so I went to work. The Manager heard the noise and came rushing over to see what had happened. When he appeared, I was on my knees inspecting (examining)some of the cartons to see if any of the eggs were broken, but to him it looked as though I was the criminal. He severely scolded me and wanted me to pay for any broken eggs. I protested my innocence and tried to explain, but it did no good. Even though I quickly forgot all about the incident, obviously the manager did not."	['about 23']

This passage mainly tells us something about _ .	"One of today's hottest topics among women (and to an extent among men too now) is anti aging and how to reverse the signs of age.The beauty industry has responded to this by offering a wide collection of anti aging creams and other anti aging products aimed at all pocketbooks,ranging from economical to highly priced. And the question is ""do any of these often much-vaunted anti aging creams actually work?"" And if they do,how precisely do they perform their miracles? Well the appropriate response to that is that they do work - after a fashion.There certainly are anti aging creams available for a ly modest price that will reduce the appearance of wrinkles in a comparatively short period of regular application.But this really is the limit of their powers: they won't actually undo skin damage or eradicate all signs of age;they will simply modify them,some more effectively than others. The way they work is like so: they remove upper layers of dead skin cells and make deeper layers absorb water,serving to plump them up and make them look fuller and healthier.But since such anti aging creams only go skin deep,as it were,skin damage will reappear once you stop using the anti aging wrinkle cream. This means fairly heavy regular use,which might be costly depending on your choice of product.However,if you can afford it or think it's worth the cost,it won't be such an issue.After all,what woman wants to look older than her years when looking good is so tied up with many women's self-esteem and sense of identity. A compromise solution for those _ is to use the cheaper creams.In addition,it's always wise to be a little experimental to make sure you end up with the one that suits your skin best. So,to sum up: an anti wrinkle face cream will work within limits,depending on your objective."	['anti aging creams']
Why is the percentage of foreign-born workers so high in Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates?	The world's population is more mobile today than ever before. In 2010, more than 200 million people left their home countries to live in a new country. This is about 3 percent of the total world population. Some experts believe that number will swell to 400 million by 2050. Rates of immigration have remained strong for the last 300 years, but patterns of immigration have changed since World War II. The backgrounds and experiences of today's immigrants are different from those of the typical European immigrant of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Contemporary immigrants range from unskilled laborers to highly skilled professionals, and they come from and go to countries all over the world. In the nineteenth century and until World War II, immigration was primarily in one direction- from the Old World to the New World. This is no longer the case. Countries such as Russia and China, which have long been, and continue to be, significant source countries, are now also destination countries. There is also considerable mobility inside regions, such as from one European country to another, or among the countries of the former Soviet Union. In spite of such differences, the push and pull factors for immigration remain essentially the same as they were 100 years ago. Most people move to another country because they want a better life. For the majority of immigrants, this means better economic conditions. As in past generations, a labor shortage in one country often draws workers from another country, especially if wages are significantly higher. In some small countries, for example, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, there are more jobs than citizens. The demand for labor is so high that the majority of the population consists of foreign-born workers, ranging from highly skilled engineers and financial experts to domestic and construction workers. In traditional destination countries, such as the United States, however, labor needs have changed. Today, although there is still demand for unskilled labor, there is increasing demand for people with a high level of skill and education. The need for less skilled labor has shifted to other countries. As work on farms and in industry in the United States and Canada once drew workers from all over the world, now work in factories in Taiwan and south Korea attracts workers from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Most global immigration is legal: however, a large number of people also move across national borders illegally in pursuit of employment. Experts estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of immigrants worldwide are in their new countries illegally. The United States has the largest number of these immigrants, followed by South Africa, with significant numbers also in Northern and Western Europe and Mexico. These immigrants face particular challenges because they often must hide from the authorities who might deport them back to their home countries. Their illegal status also means that employers may take advantage of them by forcing them to work longer hours and paying them less than the legal minimum wage. Although economics remains the most important motivation in all forms of immigrant, other factors are also important. Some people decide to leave their home countries because their actions or political beliefs make it dangerous for them to remain. Others choose to leave because their home country has become too dangerous and unstable, often because of war or political unrest. They wish to find a place that is secure for themselves and their families. Education is also a significant factor for many modern immigrants. They want to raise their children in a place where they can get a good education, which, in turn, they hope will provide them with better prospects for the future. Finally, family and community ties also play a role in immigration decisions. As in the past, once a group of people from one country establishes a community in a new country, more people from that country is likely to follow. The pattern, direction, and rate of immigration may change as the global economy changes. However, as long as life in a new country is more attractive than life in the old country, immigration will continue.

"Why is Bhutan regarded as ""the happiest country""?"

Bhutan is the only country in the world that has a 'GNH',which refers to ""Gross National Happiness.''The process of measuring GNH began when Bhutan opened up to globalization.It measures people's quality of life,and makes sure that ""material and spiritual development happen together.""Bhutan has done an amazing job of finding this balance.Bhutan has continually been ranked as the happiest country in all of Asia,and the eighth Happiest Country in the world according to Business Week.In 2007,Bhutan had the second fastest growing GDP in the world,at the same time as maintaining their environment and cultural identity. In 2008,in Bhutan's first democratic election,28-year-old Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wang Chuck was elected president of Bhutan.He promises to ""maintain a stance of protection against the worst aspects of globalization,maintaining the 'Gross National Happiness'.""But Jigme himself is no stranger to globalization.He attended high school at Phillips Academy and university at Wheaton College and then graduated from Oxford."

Which of the following can be used as the title of the news?	"BBC London Tributes continue to be paid at home and abroad to Margaret Thatcher after her death at the age of 87. David Cameron, the present Prime Minister, said she had been a ""great Briton"" while US President Obama called her a ""great champion of freedom and liberty"". Her funeral is expected to be held next week. Thatcher, Britain's first female premier, was in power from 1979 to 1990 and won three successive general elections. She died ""peacefully"" after suffering a stroke on April 8th 2013. She will not have a state funeral but will be accorded the same status as Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. The Union Jack above Number 10 Downing Street has been lowered to half-mast to pay tributes. ""In an era in which politicians are all too often greeted with indifference, it is easy to forget that Britain was once led by a woman who inspired passion."" says Nick Robinson, a well-known BBC political editor. After cutting short a trip to Europe to return to London, Cameron described Thatcher as ""the patriot prime minister"" and ""greatest peacetime"" leader. While acknowledging that she had ""divided opinion"", Cameron said she had ""taken a country that was on its knees and made it stand tall again."" ""Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had,"" he added. Her other successors in No 10--- Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown --- paid tribute to her strength of character and political purpose while Labour leader Ed Miliband said Thatcher had been a ""unique figure"" who ""reshaped the politics of a whole generation."" But critics and her opponents questioned the economic and social impact of her policies, ex-Labour leader Lord Kinnock saying her economic policies had been a ""disaster for Britain"" at the time. Among international reaction, Obama said ""America has lost a true friend"" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would ""never forget her part in overcoming the division of Europe"". Nick Robinson said Thatcher, who had suffered poor health for several years, would always be a divisive politician but one who inspired ""passion"" among her critics and supporters. She was in power when the UK won a war following Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982,but during her later years in office, she was increasingly at odds with other senior figures in the Conservative Party."

Parents and teens want to be right because they want to _ .	For many parents , raising a teenager is like fighting a long war ,but years go by without any clear winner . Like a border conflict between neighboring countries ,the parent-teen war is about boundaries: Where is the line between what I control and what you do? Both sides want peace ,but neither feels it has any power to stop the conflict . In part ,this is because neither is willing to admit .any responsibility for starting it . From the parents' point of view, the only cause of their fight is their adolescents' complete unreasonableness. And of course . . Both feel trapped In this article. I'll describe three no-win situations that commonly arise between teens and parents and then suggest some ways out of the trap. The first no-win situation is quarrels over unimportant things . Examples include the color of the teen's hair, the cleanliness of the bedroom ,the preferred style of clothing , the child's failure to eat a good breakfast before school ,or his tendency to sleep until noon on the weekends .Second ,blaming.The goal of a blaming battle is to make the other admit that his bad attitude is the reason why everything goes wrong . Third , needing to be right ,It doesn't matter what the topic is -politics. The taws of physics ,or the proper way to break an egg -the point of these arguments is to prove that you are right and the other person is wrong .for both wish to be considered an authority--someone who actually knows something -- and therefore to command respect. Unfortunately , as long as long as parents and teens continue to assume that they know more than the other ,they'll continue to fight these battles forever and never make any real progress	['gain respect from the other']
Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"ROME: The legend of Leonardo da Vinci is covered in mystery: How did he die? Are the remains buried in a French castle really those of the master? Was the ""Mona Lisa"" a self-portrait in disguise ? A group of Italian scientists believe the key to solving those puzzles lies with the remains, and they say they are seeking permission to dig up the body to conduct carbon and DNA testing. If the skull is undamaged, the scientists can go to the heart of a question that has fascinated scholars and the public for centuries: the identity of the ""Mona Lisa."" Recreating a virtual and then physical reconstruction of Leonardo's face, they can compare it with the smiling face in the painting. ""We don't know what we'll find if the tomb is opened. We could even just find grains and dust,"" says Giorgio Gruppioni, an anthropologist who is participating in the project. ""But if the remains are well kept, they are a biological record of events in a person's life, and sometimes in their death."" Silvano Vinceti, the leader of the group, said that _ in charge of the said burial site at Amboise Castle early next week. Leonardo moved to France at the invitation of King Francis I, who named him ""first painter to the king."" He spent the last three years of his life there, and died in 1519 at age 67. The artist's original burial place, the palace church of Saint Florentine, was destroyed during the French Revolution and remains that are believed to be his were eventually reburied in the Saint-Hubert Chapel near the castle. ""The Amboise tomb is a symbolic tomb; it's a big question mark,"" said Alessandro Vezzosi, the director of a museum dedicated to Leonardo in his hometown of Vinci. Vezzosi said that investigating the tomb could help identify the artist's bones with certainty and solve other questions, such as the cause of his death. He said he asked to open the tomb in 2004 to study the remains, but the Amboise Castle turned him down. The group of 100 experts involved in the project, called the National Committee for Historical and Artistic Heritage, was created in 2003 with the aim of ""solving the great mysteries of the past,"" said Vinceti, who has written books on art and literature. Arguably the world's most famous painting, the ""Mona Lisa"" hangs in the Louvre in Paris, where it drew some 8.5 million visitors last year. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the painting's subject for centuries, with opinions ranging from the wife of a Florentine merchant to Leonardo's own mother. That Leonardo intended the ""Mona Lisa"" as a self-portrait in disguise is a possibility that has interested and divided scholars. Theories have existed: Some think that Leonardo's taste for tricks and riddles might have led him to hide his own identity behind that puzzling smile; others have guessed that the painting hid an androgynous lover. If granted access to the grave site, the Italian experts plan to use a tiny camera and radar to confirm the presence of bones. The scientists would then exhume the remains and attempt to date the bones with carbon testing. At the heart of the proposed study is the effort to discover whether the remains are actually Leonardo's, including with DNA testing. Vezzosi questions the DNA comparison, saying he is unaware of any direct descendants of Leonardo or of tombs that could be attributed with certainty to the artist's close relatives. Gruppioni said that DNA from the bones could also eventually be compared to DNA found elsewhere. For example, Leonardo is thought to have rubbed colors on the canvas with his thumb, possibly using saliva , meaning DNA might be found on his paintings. Even in the absence of DNA testing, other tests could provide useful information, including whether the bones belonged to a man or a woman, and whether the person died young or old. Even within the committee, experts are divided over the identity of the ""Mona Lisa."" Vinceti believes that a tradition of considering the self-portrait to be not just a faithful imitation of one's features but a representation of one's spiritual identity may have resonated with Leonardo. Vezzosi, the museum director, dismissed as ""baseless and senseless"" the idea that the ""Mona Lisa"" could be a self-portrait of Leonardo. He said most researchers believe the woman may have been either a wife of the artist's sponsor, the Florentine nobleman Giuliano de Medici, or Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a rich silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The traditional view is that the name ""Mona Lisa"" comes from the silk merchant's wife, as well as its Italian name: ""La Gioconda."""	['Scientists doubt if the remains are those of da Vinci']
Douglas drew the picture of a hand because _ .	"Thanksgiving Day was near. The first grade teacher gave her class some fun homework---to draw a picture of something for which they were thankful. Most of the class drew a turkey or other traditional things. But Douglas drew a different kind of picture. He drew a hand. Just an empty hand. Douglas was a different boy. He was poor and unhappy. As other children played, Douglas was likely to stand close by the teacher's side. His classmates were surprised at his picture. One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer, because farmers _ turkeys. Others guessed it was the hand of God, for God feeds us. The teacher asked him whose hand it was. The little boy said in a low voice, ""It's yours."" She remembered the times she had taken his hand and walked with him here and there, as she had the other students. How often she said, ""Take my hand, Douglas, we'll go outside."" Or, ""Let me show you how to hold your pencil."" Or, ""Let's do this together."" Douglas was most thankful for his teacher's hand. Tears came into the teacher's eyes."	"[""Douglas was most thankful for his teacher's hand""]"
We can learn from the passage that the little girl .	"A few weeks ago, a friend of Smile Groups gifted me PS100 to do good deeds with. Since then I have used the money in the U.K. and the U.S and have helped some strangers, generally raising a lot of smiles. They have warmed my heart, but none so much as the gift I was able to give just an hour ago. I was in a shop looking at the second-hand books. It just so happened that the bookshelves were next to the toy section. After a few minutes I became aware of a group of women standing behind me. They were poorly dressed and spoke in what sounded like an eastern European language. As the little girl, about three years old, came over to the toy section, immediately her attention was caught by a toy. She spoke to her mother and in halting English her mother asked the shop assistant how much it cost. PS3 was the answer. The mum looked down at her child, perhaps calculating what she still had to buy and how much money she would have left. Then she simply shook her head. The child didn't react badly as some children might. Being told no was obviously not a new experience for her. But she couldn't keep the disappointment from her face. I had the total of four pounds in my pocket, two PS2 coins. A moment later, I tapped the mother on the shoulder, and pointed to the coins which I had left and said, ""Buy her a dolly, too."" I didn't hang about to see the end result. _ . I made my way out of the shop and into the sunshine. The money my friend gave me was an investment in the happiness of the world. Was there any better way, I wondered, to get so much happiness with so little money than to buy a toy for a little girl?"	['lived in a poor family']
The main idea of this passage is that _ .	Can you imagine exchanging the pleasure of city life for a quiet life in the countryside? Many people want to move from the country to the city because they think that life in the city is more exciting and better than that in countryside, especially young people who like new, modern things. People like popular things and feel that they can only find the latest styles in the city. However, it is possible to enjoy the higher quality of country life and still enjoy some of the advantages of living in the city. Nowadays, traveling is fast and easy, and information can be found on the Internet, so many people are able to do their work in home offices. Because they have e-mail and personal computers, they don't have to be in big cities to manage their businesses. It is not important where they actually work because the results of their work can be sent everywhere with e-mails. Therefore, there is no need to put up with all of the disadvantages of the city. Now they can escape busy city life to enjoy the quiet country life and still be able to have successful jobs. Other people are interested in technological things and high-tech jobs and think they can only find them in big cities. If they want to find a job, especially a good position in a company, they think that they have to live in a city. For these jobs, they are willing to put up with many of the disadvantages of city life, such as crime, heavy traffic, and pollution.	['life in the city is different from life in the countryside']
We may use more electricity by _ .	When you watch TV and play video games you make global warming worse! It may seem hard to believe, but when electricity is made, so are greenhouse gases . This means that every time you use electricity you help make global warming worse! Cars are also making global warming worse. They burn fossil fuels in their engines, and send lots of greenhouse gases into the air. Global warming may be a big problem, but we can all help stop it. People can try to drive their cars less. Or even get ones that run on sunlight! You can also help. Let's try one of these top ideas: (1) Try to use less electricity. Turn off lights, your television, and your computer when you've stopped using them. To make electricity, fossil fuels are burned in big factories. But burning fossil fuels also makes greenhouse gases. You should also try to watch less TV. (2) Plant trees. Not only is it a fun thing to do, but it is also a great way to lower the number of greenhouse gases in the air. Trees take carbon dioxide out of the air when they grow. (3) Don't throw away your rubbish, try to recycle it. If rubbish is not recycled, it is put in the ground. There it rots and makes a greenhouse gas called methane .So try to recycle cans, bottles, plastic bags and newspapers. It'll make you feel great! And it'll help the Earth.	['turning up CD players']

Which of the following about Mark Zuckerberg is true?	If you had billions of dollars,would you give away almost all of it to charity ?Well that's what Mark Zuckerberg,CEO and founder of Facebook,just said he would do.Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan promised to give 99 percent of their money to society.Right now that is about $45 billion(289 billion yuan),and they plan to give away the money to things like science and education. Many billionaires have done similar things,for example,Bill Gates.But giving back and helping others isn't just for big billionaires.People like Zuckerberg and Gates may have more to give,but people with less are doing it too.Especially around the holidays,people want to do their part and give back to people who are less lucky than them.Schools may have food collections where people bring some food and together they can give away some other things to places like homeless centers. People also host special events like concerts or runs to be creative while raising money.Common people give away whatever they can to US charities like the United Way and the American Red Cross. Then these charities are able to help the poor in different ways like education,health and improving their lives.These things come together to make a big difference.

What can we learn from the writer's example?	"Our bedroom has no full-length mirror. There is one at the canteen entrance. I always cherish a secret desire to take a glance before it at myself in a beautiful new dress. However, each time when it comes to the fulfillment, I get seized with such an uneasiness that I literally stagger away--backing out at the critical moment. At the root of it is my lack of confidence by which I have been enslaved since childhood. It embarrasses me at the mildest praise, crushes my utmost efforts to say ""No"", and prevents me from asking my parents for one cent more than necessary. Among other things, lack of confidence has wormed its way into my love of piano. At the age of 14, one Sunday morning, I was woken up by a resounding hymn . Tracing that call of God into a neighboring church, I found myself deeply attracted by the melody of a piano--something beyond the means of my parents. To make it worse, people say a pianist is supposed to have music in the blood, but I believe I had none from my engineer father and technician mother. For days on end, I kept thinking of nothing else. I had a dream. It wasn't a dream after gold, which made some of my close friends to engage in business as self-employed traders or street peddlers. I was sometimes dazzled by their gold rings or elegant necklaces behind which, however, I seemed to catch sight of skeletons in their cupboards and was frightened away from the craze for fortunate. Out of despair, I kept it to myself, lack of confidence weighing heavy on me. I could do nothing but turn to my dream for comfort, for courage to aim high and wish for the impossible. I was convinced that before I could afford anything expensive (to me, it was a piano), I should climb up the academic ladder as high as possible. For the next nine years, I carefully held back my desire for music to keep my search for learning, especially in English studies. My efforts were so rewarding that I went successfully through high school and college in my hometown. When I received the admission notice for a second degree course at a famous university in Beijing, the national capital, tears welled up in my eyes. I knew my command of English was my wealth, for I might make a deal with a pianist who would give me access to his piano in exchange for English lessons. And that has come true! To this day, whenever I lay my fingers on the snow-white keyboard, ready for a melody, I still feel shy. I am quite aware of my limited music talent, but as a shy dreamer, I have found my way to success."	['We should make every effort to turn a dream into reality.']
According to the text, why was it easier for Laura Straub to find American families for foreign students?	"WASHINGTON--Laura Straub is a very worried woman. Her job is to find families for French teenagers who expect to live with American families in the summer. It is not easy, even hopeless. ""We have many children left to place--40 out of 75,"" said Straub, who works for a Paris-based foreigner-exchange program started 50 years ago. Family life was more than accommodating . For one thing, more mothers stayed at home. But now, increasing numbers of women work outside the home. Exchange-student programs have struggled in recent years to sign up host families for the 30 000 teenagers who every year come from abroad to spend a school year in the United States, as well as the thousands more who take part in summer programs. School systems in many parts of the U.S., unhappy about accepting non-taxpaying students, have also strictly limited the number of exchange students they accepted. At the same time, the idea of hosting foreign students is becoming less _ . In search for host families, who usually receive no pay, exchange programs are increasingly broadening their requests to include everyone from young couples to retirees. ""We are open to many different types of families,"" said Vickie Weiner, eastern area director for ASSE, a 25-year-old program that sends about 30 000 teenagers on school-year exchange programs worldwide.

The passengers had been waiting for a couple of hours for an airline employee to open the door leading to the plane outside. No one was in a good mood. An old man got trapped in the middle of the rush. He fell down without being able to break his fall. His head hit the concrete floor. Blood poured from his forehead. He appeared to be unconscious. Everyone rushed past him, except Dana. She called for help. A minute later, a young airline employee showed up. Hardly looking at the old man, she told Dana to get aboard her plane. She said the old man would be okay, and walked away. Dana screamed for help. An airport supervisor appeared. He told Dana to get on the plane. Dana said that she was not moving until an ambulance arrived. The supervisor said her plane would leave without her. Dana said that she didn't care. An ambulance and two attendants finally arrived. The attendants said that the man would be okay, but he would need stitches . They put him into the ambulance and drove off. On her way out to the plane, which was still refueling, Dana saw the employee who had ignored the old man at first. The employee said, ""You're lucky. The plane didn't leave without you.""

How would you like it if everyone just stepped over your grandfather and went on their way?"""	['sympathetic']
Mark Twain lay on his side on the end of the bed because he _ .	How much sleep do we need? We are all different. Some people need only three hours of sleep a night. Others need ten hours of sleep a night. Most Americans sleep an average of seven to eight hours a night. After the age of fifty the average sleep time goes down to 6.5 hours a night. Most people have a bad night when they can not sleep. About one in three Americans has a problem with sleep. Many of these people can not fall sleep. This problem is called insomnia. This is not a new problem. Many famous people in history had insomnia. Some of these people had special ideas to another to make them sleep. Benjaming Franklin, the famous stateman and inventor ,had four beds. He moved from one to another to fall asleep. King Lousis XIV of France had 13 beds and hoped that he could fall asleep in one of them. Mark Twain, the famous American writer, had a different way. He lay on his side on the end of the bed!

What can we learn about the author's mother?	My mother has always been a follower of traditional methods when it comes to anything. She cooks traditional food,likes dressing up traditionally and likes the traditional way of shopping. She loves going to markets and going from one shop to another to find out what suits her best. She can walk miles when it comes to shopping along with her friends. She knows all the local markets and shops and knows very well where she can get best discounts . However,now she always gets tired when she goes out in the market. So one day I decided to introduce a new shop,which is much larger than usual markets and where she can also get discounts.I am talking about online gift stores. She has a basic knowledge of computers and can operate computers. At the beginning,she was doubtful about shopping from these online gift shops because she wasn't too sure about the quality of the products. One day I decided to get her some branded things so that she could build trust in these shops. I ordered a Timex watch and a Sisley handbag for her. She never bought things online,but when they were delivered as a gift,she jumped for joy. She could not believe that I had ordered these gifts for her despite her being not much positive about online shops. However,after she saw both the products,she was assured that these online gift shops sent the promised brands and products,she loved her new watch and handbag. After this experience she ordered a gift for her friend's wedding. She chose a gift basket that could be made according to her requirements. They sent a beautifully decorated basket with fine wines and chocolates. The basket was so artistically decorated that it became her friend's favorite gift. Since then she has been consistently shopping online.	['She lives in a traditional way.']
Which of the following does NOT belong to the qualities of eggplant?	"What's delicious to eat and comes in a variety of color1s? Eggplant! And no, it has nothing to do with chickens! This strangely named vegetable is, however, as versatile as an egg.It can be steamed, fried, and baked.It can be eaten by itself or combined with meats and other vegetables. Eggplant was first grown in India in the 5th century BC. Its popularity soon spread to China and then throughout Asia.Finally, during the Middle Ages the vegetable made its way to Europe. At that time, eggplant was not the shiny purple vegetable most people know today.Instead, it resembled a white egg. Due to this egg-like appearance, eggplant got its name.In its early days, the vegetable was so bitter that people often called it a ""mad apple."" This nickname started because people believed its bitterness was bad for one' s health. People actually thought eggplant could cause insanity and cancer. Fortunately today people know that eggplant doesn't cause insanity or cancer.In fact eggplant is so healthy that it may prevent cancer.In addition, the brain and the heart benefit from this super vegetable.Since it's high in fiber, eggplant can improve digestion. Italy, Turkey, Egypt, China and Japan are the leading growers of eggplant in the world today.Depending on its location, eggplant may be purple, green, orange or yellow-white.And it can be as small as a tomato or as large as a cucumber.Dish varieties range from simple to complex, with all of them being delicious. Today, thousands of people gather in Loomis, Calif, for the annual Loomis Eggplant Festival.The main activity at the festival is eating delicious eggplant dishes.There is plenty more to do and see, though.Recipe contests, arts and crafts, performers, races and children's activities all ""egg-cite"" festival-goers.Most people at the festival would agree--eggplant is an ""egg-cellent"" vegetable."

According to the passage, _ made Yaser a little confused.	"Steve and Yaser first met in their chemistry class at an American university. Yaser was an international student from Jordan. He wanted to learn more about American culture and hoped that he and Steve would become good friends. At first, Steve seemed very friendly. He always greeted Yaser warmly before class. Sometimes he offered to study with Yaser. He even invited Yaser to have lunch with him. But after the term was over, Steve seemed distant. The two former classmates didn't see each other very often at school. One day Yaser decided to call Steve. Steve didn't seem very interested in talking to him. Yaser was hurt by Steve's change of attitude. ""Steve said we were friends,"" Yaser complained, ""and I thought friends were friends forever."" Yaser was a little confused. As a foreigner, he doesn't understand the way Americans view friendship. Americans use the word ""friend"" in a very general way. They may call both casual acquaintances(;) and close companions ""friends"". These friendships are based on common interests. When the shared activity ends, the friendship may fade . Now as Steve and Yaser are no longer classmates, their ""friendship"" has changed. In some cultures friendship means a strong lifelong bond between two people. In these cultures friendships develop slowly, since they are built to last. American society is one of rapid change. Studies show that one out five American families moves every year. American friendships develop quickly, and _ may change just quickly as well. People from the United States may at first seem friendly. Americans often chat easily with strangers. But American friendliness is not always an offer of true friendship. After an experience like Yaser's , people who've been in this country for only a few months may consider Americans to be fickle . Learning how Americans view friendship can help non-Americans avoid misunderstandings. It can also help them make friends in the American way."	"[""Steve's cold attitude""]"

What did Crosby say about people in the 1960s?	"Grandparents Answer a Call As a third generation native of Brownsville, Texas, Mildred Garza never pleased move away. Even when her daughter and son asked her to move to San Antonio to help their children, she politely refused. Only after a year of friendly discussion did Ms Gaf finally say yes. That was four years ago. Today all three generations regard the move to a success, giving them a closer relationship than they would have had in separate cities. No statistics show the number of grandparents like Garza who are moving closer to the children and grandchildren. Yet there is evidence suggesting that the trend is growing. Even President Obama's mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, has agreed to leave Chicago and into the White House to help care for her granddaughters. According to a study grandparents. com, 83 percent of the people said Mrs. Robinson's decision will influence the grandparents in the American family. Two-thirds believe more families will follow the example of Obama's family. ""In the 1960s we were all a little wild and couldn't get away from home far enough fast enough to prove we could do it on our own,""says Christine Crosby, publisher of grate magazine for grandparents. ""We now realize how important family is and how important to be near them, especially when you're raising children."" Moving is not for everyone. Almost every grandparent wants to be with his or her grandchildren and is willing to make sacrifices, but sometimes it is wiser to say no and visit frequently instead. Having your grandchildren far away is hard, especially knowing your adult child is struggling, but giving up the life you know may be harder."	['They wanted to live away from their parents.']

How much does a new-born blue whale weigh?	The largest animal ever to live on Earth is the blue whale . It weighs about 80 tons-more than 24 big elephants. It is more than 30 metres long. A new baby whale weighs as much as a big elephant. Cats won't die if they fall off very high places because they can turn themselves up the right way so as to keep their bodies safe. One cat fell off 32 floors onto the street, but it was just hurt a little. A bear can run as fast as a horse. A new-born panda is smaller than a mouse and weighs about 100 grams. Elephants are the most careful animals in their love. A male elephant may show his lady love for up to three years until the female elephant takes his love. They often show their love by touching each other's body. Usually, wolves do not hurt people. For years a Canadian newspaper says that they would give anyone a lot of money if he or she could show that a wolf could hurt a person. But nobody could do that. Wolves do not usually go together though they may do this in winter and they only hurt people at an unusual time.	['About 3 tons']

Which category does the passage most probably belong to?	The great white shark is the largest shark and is probably the most well-known and feared shark. The great white shark is gray or bluish above and white below. The largest Great Whites can reach lengths of 22 feet and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. The Great White has massive teeth, which are positioned in rows. When the Great White attacks, it bites its prey and shakes its head back and forth. The serrated teeth act as a saw and literally tear the victim apart. Actually the Great White Shark often swallows many of its own teeth in an attack. Great Whites employ several hunting skills depending on the prey. Most of the time, the shark will remain still underwater before attacking its prey from underneath. In the case of hunting some kinds of seals, the impact of the shark is so powerful that it knocks both the shark and the seal clear out of the water. With larger prey such as elephant seals, the shark will simply take a huge bite out of it and wait for it to bleed to death. When hunting dolphins, the shark will attack from above, to avoid detection from the dolphin's echolocation. Interestingly, a Great White Shark has never been observed giving birth. However, pregnant females have been caught. The Great White Shark is known to be ovoviviparous. Females give birth to eight or nine pups that are already about five feet in length upon birth, which is different from other egg-laying animals. Despite the fear of Great White Sharks, at least in part generated by Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie, Jaws, Great White Sharks do not target humans as prey. Most attacks are attributed to mistaken identity. Sharks can easily mistake humans for seals. Many human injuries caused by Great White Sharks are cases of test-biting. If a shark is unsure about a floating object, it often gives it test bite to determine what kind of object it is. While such bites do little damage to buoys and other objects, they obviously can cause serious damage on the human body.	['Nature']
What kind of man is the writer?	"I wished I had known earlier the fact that I was a low achiever because there was a reason beyond my control. Then I needn't have worked so hard in my late twenties and early thirties. But I just didn't know that. I was writing and writing. I was working for no other reason than to hear people praise me. Most people who go through university read at least twice as fast as I do. I can never tell my left from my right. I avoid dialing a telephone if I can help it, because I sometimes have to try three times before getting the number right. I hear that recording ""The number you have reached is not in service"" more than any man on earth. Despite my weaknesses I view my dyslexia(difficulty in reading) as a gift, not a curse . Many dyslexics are good at right brain, namely abstract thought, and that is what my king of creative writing is. I'm starting with nothing and coming up with something that didn't exist before. That's my strong point. I owe my career to Ralph, Salisbury, my writing instructor at the University of Oregon, who looked past my misspellings and gave me encouragement and hope. I just carried on and never looked back. I'm also very ""visual"". This means nothing in school, but when I write books or scripts, I'm seeing everything in my imagination. I write quickly. I go like the wind and can get up to 15 pages a day. Writing is not the problem. I have no problem downloading; it is inputting where things get messed up. The real fear I have for dyslexics is not that they have to struggle with messy input, but that they will quit on themselves before they finish school. Parents have to create victories whenever they can, whether it is music, sports or the arts. You want your dyslexic child to be able to say, ""Yeah, reading is hard. But I have these other things I can do."""	['Open-minded and optimistic']

We learn from the text that last Saturday Mr. Yuen _ .	To: manager@ tastytreat.com.ca Date: Monday, 7 October, 3:34p.m. From: raymondyuen@ canada.net Subject: Complaint Dear Mr. Price, I have eaten in your restaurant many times and have always been happy with the food and service. This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing. It was my son's birthday so we booked a no-smoking table at your restaurant for 7:30 p.m. We arrived on time but were told that our table was not yet ready. At 8:00 p.m., we were given a table in the smoking section. I asked to move but I was told that there were no other tables. A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable and unhealthy. Our first waitress, Janet, was very polite and helpful. She gave us free drinks for waiting so long. Our food also came quickly and looked fresh and tasty. When my wife had eaten most of her meal, she found a dead cockroach in her vegetables. She was shocked and wanted to leave. At first, the waitress told us it was a piece of garlic . When we told her that garlic does not have legs, she apologized and took the food away. We asked for the bill, expecting not to pay for my wife's meal. Nobody came. After 15 minutes, I asked to see the manager. The head waiter told us that you were on holiday. I complained again about the horrible cockroach. He told me Janet had finished work. He didn't believe my story and gave me a bill for three meals. I argued with him but was forced to pay. The waitress, Janet, was always friendly, but I would like an apology from your impolite head waiter and a full refund for our meal. It cost $68. Until then, I will not be eating at your restaurant or recommending it to anyone. You can contact me at 742-3254 or through e-mail if you want more information. Thank you for your attention. Yours sincerely, Raymond Yuen	['was disappointed with the restaurant']
If such unhappy people insist on keeping the habit, the author suggests that people should _ .	There are two types of people in the world. Although they have an equal degree of health and wealth and other comforts of life, one becomes happy, while the other becomes unhappy. This arises from the different ways in which they consider things, persons and events and the resulting effects upon their minds. People who are happy fix their attention on the convenience of things. They enjoy all cheerful things. Those who are unhappy think and speak only of unpleasant things. Through their remarks, they _ , offend many people, and make themselves disagreeable everywhere. If this turn of mind is founded in nature, such unhappy people should be pitied. The intention of criticizing and being disliked is perhaps taken up by imitation . It grows into a habit, unknown to its possessors. The habit may be strong, but it can be cured when those who have it realize its bad effects. Although this attitude is mainly an act of the imagination, it has serious results since it brings on deep sorrow and bad luck. If such people aim at getting some advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone speak a word in favor of their hopes. If they are criticized, no one will defend or excuse them, and many will join in criticizing their wrong doings. So they should change this bad habit and stop worrying needlessly about themselves and others. If they do not, it will be good for others to avoid any contact with them. Otherwise, they will have a disagreeable time, especially when someone becomes mixed up in their quarrels.	['not have any communication with them']
Why will less than ten percent of office workers kill the time with their colleagues at weekends?	During the week days, they are luckily busy office people; but on weekends, they are just a brood of stay-home animals. A recent survey shows that office workers in China prefer quiet and easy ways to spend their weekends. In the survey, conducted by job seeking and offering website Zhaopin.com, 32.8 percent of the 6,000 respondents choose to stay home at weekends and have a good rest, the Beijing Morning Post reported. Twenty percent use their days-off to do housework. And only 19.3 percent are willing to have fun during the break time from work. Their first choice of fun is shopping. Other choices, though practiced by few, include meeting friends, accompanying the children, trips to the suburbs, and lessons for more skills. When they. go shopping, 54.5 percent of the white-collars actually shop in supermarkets, while 27.9. percent attend other stores, especially when discounts are offered. These activities don't seem to cost much, as 60 percent spend average less than 200 yuan (US$26) during weekends, and 30 percent no more than 500 yuan. When asked whom they would spend the weekends with, about 40 percent mention their partners, and 30 percent prefer a weekend all by themselves. Less than 20 percent hang out with friends. Only 5.8 percent would kill the time with their colleagues. This is because we tend to avoid too many personal contacts with our co-workers when we don't have to work with them, according to some experts.	"[""Because they tend to avoid too many personal contacts with hem when they don't have to.""]"
After the writer was twelve years old, she _ .	"Until I was twelve years old, I thought everyone in the world knew about the grinnies, if I thought about the term at all -- which is unlikely. After all, everyone in my family used the word quite naturally, and we understood each other. So far as I knew, it was a word like any other word -- like bath, orchocolate, orhomework. But it was my homework which led to my discovery thatgrinnieswas a word not known outside my family. My last report card had said that I was a ""C"" student in English, and my parents, both teachers, decided that no child of theirs would be just an average student of anything. So nightly I spelled words aloud and answered questions about the fine points of grammar. I wrote and rewrote and rewrote every composition until I convinced my mother that I could make no more improvements. And the hard work paid off. One day the teacher returned compositions, and there it was -- a big fat, bright red ""A"" on the top of my paper. Naturally, I was delighted, but I didn't know I was attracting attention until the teacher spoke sharply, ""Helen, what are you doing?"" Called suddenly out of my happy thoughts, I said ""Oh, I've got the grinnies!"" The teacher and my classmates burst into laughter, and then I understood that grinnies were used inside my family. Other people were not so lucky. And it is really lucky to have the grinnies, an uncontrollable, natural state of great pleasure. Grinnies are shown on the outside by sparkling eyes and a wide, wide smile -- not just any smile, but one that shows the teeth and stretches the mouth to its limits. A person experiencing the grinnies appears to be all mouth. On the inside grinnies are characterized by a feeling of joyful anxiety. Grinnies usually last just a few seconds, but they can come and go. Sometimes, when life seems just perfect, I have occasional attacks of the grinnies for a whole day. The term originated in my mother's family. Her younger sister, Rose, who had deep dimples , often expressed her pleasure with such a grin that the dimples appeared to become permanent. When Rose was about four, she started explaining her funny look by saying, ""I have the grinnies"". The term caught on, and it has been an important word in our family now for two generations. The occasion doesn't matter. Anything can bring on the grinnies -- just so long as one feels great delight. When my brother finally rode his bicycle -- without training wheels -- from our house to the corner and back, he came home with the grinnies. When I was little, my mother's announcement that we would have homemade ice cream for dessert always gave me the grinnies. My father had the grinnies when I was chosen to make a speech at the end-of-school-year ceremony. Grinnies can be brought on by a good meal, a sense of pride, a new friend, a telephone call from someone special, an achievement. Or sometimes one gets the grinnies for no reason at all: just a sudden sense of happiness can bring on a case. Whatever brings them on, an attack of the grinnies is among life's greatest pleasures. In fact, now that I look back on the experience, I feel sorry for my seventh-grade teacher. I think it's a pity that she didn't know the word grinnies. It's such a useful term for saying, ""I'm really, really pleased!"""	"['got to know ""grinnies"" was used only inside her family']"
Western films spoke highly of people's _ . Which of the following is NOT included?	Western films play an important role in the history of American films. They are set in the American West. Most of the heroes are from famous novels. They speak highly of people's spirit, courage and building everything all by themselves. Early western films were mostly filmed in the studio, just like other early Hollywood films. With the development of technology, it began to be filmed at movie ranches from the 1930s. Often, the vast _ becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen technologies began to be used. During this time, the most typical western films focused on huge plains, soldiers or tourists, they were always the most handsome men. Until recent times, western films seem to be a little out of date. For example, the guns are always some old ones. They were frequently used in films set in the 1870s. In the late 1960s, things began to change. Some new guns began to show in the films.	['sadness']

At the end of the passage the writer suggests that_.	Do you have any strong opinion on co-educational or single-sex schools? A supporter of co-educational schools would probably say that schools should be like the societies they belong to .In Hong Kong , men and women mix socially on a day-to-day basis .In many fields men are even likely to have female bosses .It is ,therefore, desirable that boys and girls grow up together ,go to school together ,and prepare themselves for a society that does not value sexual separation. Some would go on to argue further that growing up with members of the opposite sex is important for personal development .Regular contact can remove the strange ideas about the opposite-sex and lead to more natural relationships .Single-sex conditions are seen as leading to more extreme opinions, and possibly even as encouraging homosexuality ,though there is no proof that this is the case. Those who are against coeducation often also fix their attention on the sexual side .Some parents fear that close contact with members of the opposite sex is dangerous for teenagers .They want their children to be attentive to their studies .Such parents feel uncomfortable with modern ways and the free mixing of the sexes. A stronger argument comes from research into school results .Girls grow up earlier than boys ,tend to be more orderly and are likely to be better at languages .In a mixed class ,boys who might do well in a single-sex class become discouraged and take on the rule of troublemaker .Certainly in the UK this situation has greatly alarmed the government for it to be encouraging co-educational schools to have some single-sex classes .In the UK the best schools are all single-sex ,strongly suggesting that co-education is not the best answer .This may ,however ,not be as simple as it looks .It may simply be that the famous old schools that attract the best students happen to be single-sex ,rather than that being single-sex makes them better schools.

What is the main idea of this letter?	"Dear Micheal, How's your vacation? I'm visiting my uncle in Spain. He lives in the sunny and beautiful city of Valencia, in Spain. Yesterday, I had great fun. My uncle took me to the tomato festival in Bunol, which is just 30 miles away from where my uncle lives. You have probably never heard of this festival before. Neither had I. The tomato festival is called ""La Tomatina""in Spanish. It was the biggest and messiest tomato fight in the world. When we first got to the square where the festival took place, it was very crowded with people from all around the world, and many trucks were carrying tomatoes. My uncle told me the crowded people here were around 38,000 and this was more than four times the population of Bunol. The tomato fight started as soon as the first banger was beaten. Then everyone including me started throwing tomatoes at each other. I took red tomatoes and threw them at anyone that ran, moved, bent down, or turned around. Tomatoes must be squashed before people threw them in order not to hurt anybody. After a little while, the streets, people and nearby buildings were splashed with red. There was no winner in this fight,but we all had fun. As soon as a second banger was beaten, people stopped throwing. I really had a great time, I wish you were here, too. I hope I hear from you soon. Take care. With love, From Spain Linda"	"['""La Tomatina""is a fun and popular festival in Spain.']"
What does the old man do when he can't get a fish?	Hemingway was one of the famous writers. He was born in America in 1899.

The Old Man and the Sea is one of the most famous and also my favourite. It came out in 1952. The main character in the book is a fisherman. He is an old man and fishes alone. People think he is a man with bad luck, because he doesn't get a fish in eighty-four days. Every evening, he comes home with his empty boat. But the old man believes himself. Then on the eighty-fifth day the man takes a big fish. Although he meets a lot of trouble, the old man never gives up . ,.	"[""He doesn't give up fishing.""]"
From the passage, we can conclude that _ .	"Though there are about 400 languages from all over the world that are in danger of disappearing completely, Zoque-Ayapaneco, a native Mexican language is considered the most likely to become extinct, because the only two people in the world that speak it fluently do not talk to each other! And, it's not because they live in different countries, states or even villages. In fact, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez, both in their 70s, live within 500 yards of each other, in the village of Ayapa in the Southern Mexican State of Tabasco. They, however, refuse to communicate because they simply don't have much in common. Segovia is apparently a little flank in nature while Velazquez is described as shy. Segovia was at least able to talk in Zoque-Ayapanece with his brother until he passed away about 12 years ago, and still manages to practice it with his family, especially his son Manuel, who for the last five years has been trying to learn it and hopes to become fluent enough to teach it to the next generation. Velazquez on the other hand, has not been heard speaking in the language with anybody. The two men say the language used to be widely spoken in the village, but the younger generation _ it for fear of being laughed at, and it therefore began to die a slow death, as the elders passed away. Unless the two men get their acts together, the only way to hear the language will be to either listen to Manuel's not-so-fluent statement or see them talk in a documentary entitled ""Lengua Muerta"" (Dead Language) that is being filmed to capture Zoque Ayapaneco and 364 other native Mexican languages that are in a similar state. We sure hope Segovia and Velazquez soon find something common to talk about. Maybe the fact is that the language is dying and that they should start encouraging and teaching the next generation together."

According to the study done by Sam Costing, dog owners tend to _ than cat owners.	"ARE you a dog person or a cat person? With so many photos and videos of cats and dogs doing cute things online, it's easier than ever to answer which of these furry friends you like more. There are many reasons why people prefer one type of pet over the other. So, have you ever wondered what your preference for cats or dogs says about you? In fact, a 2010 study done by Sam Gosling , a psychologist at the University of Texas, US, and his graduate student Carson Sandy found that dog people are more extroverted agreeable and serious than cat people. ""Cats will occasionally engage in social activities, but usually after only a few minutes they will abandon the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown lull, for hours at a lime,"" said Modem Dog magazine. Just on the basis of dogs' nature being more sociable than cats', you may expect that the personalities of dog people also reflect higher sociability. And Cosling's study found that dog people are generally about 15 percent more extroverted and 13 percent more agreeable, both of which are associated with social altitude. In addition, dog people are 11 percent more conscientious than cat people. ""Conscientiousness"" is a tendency In show self-discipline ,to complete tasks and aim for achievement. This quality also shows a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior. In comparison, cat people an; about 12 percent more anxious, but they are also 11 percent more ""open"" than dog people, due to a general appreciation for art, emotion, imagination, curiosity, adventure, unusual ideas and variety of experience. And people high on openness are more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. Despite vast differences, there an some things that cat people and dog people have in common. ""Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing and generally optimists. "" noted Mother Nature Network."	['live a more organized life']

How many examples of being tricked by time are mentioned in the article?	We often find that weekends and holidays feel so short while classes and work feel so long.

In fact, this is one of the ways that we're tricked by time, according to the website All That Is Interesting. The website lists several wrong impressions we often have about time. Let's have a look. First of all, emotions affect our time-keeping abilities: Negative emotions, especially anxiety and boredom, make time seem longer because they make us concentrate more on the passage of time. However, when we are enjoying ourselves, we pay more attention to what we are doing and are likely to lose track of(...) time. Here is another example. In 2007, a group of scientists carried out a test. In the test, people fell 50 meters into a safety net and were then asked about their experience. Although the experience took shorter than 3 seconds, the people thought it was much longer than it actually was. This is because of the way our bodies reply to danger, according to the scientists. Our bodies produce a chemical called adrenaline when we are faced with danger. It allows us to concentrate better so that we can stay alive. As a result, we are able to remember far more details over a short period of time, which makes it seem like time is going more slowly. Another occasion when we make mistakes about time is when we take afternoon naps . Have you ever had trouble telling what time it is after a long nap? That's because the best amount of time for a nap is 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, you enter a new stage of sleep called slow-wave sleep. If you wake up mid-way in this stage, it will take a while before you can correctly perceive time again. Yes, time can be mysterious and there is no way to control it So, perhaps the best thing to do is to make good use of every minute.	['Three']
Which of the following is not true according to the passage?	Will it matter if you don't take your breakfast? Recently a test was given in the United States. Those tested included people of different ages, from 12 to 83. During the experiment, these people were given all kinds of breakfasts and sometimes they got no breakfast at all. Special tests were set up to see how well their bodies worked when they had eaten a certain kind of breakfast. The results show that if a person eats a proper breakfast, he or she will work with better effect than if he or she has no breakfast. This fact appears to be especially true if a person works with his brains. If a student eats fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, he will learn more quickly and listen with more attention in class. Contrary to (......) what many people believe, if you don't eat breakfast, you will not lose weight. This is because people become so hungry at noon that they eat too much for lunch, and end up gaining weight instead of losing. You will probably lose more weight if you reduce your other meals.	['Reducing lunch and supper is of less value in weight-losing.']
Which of the following is not the reason for people's frustration with the government?	"Hi, everybody. Over the past couple months, most of the political headlines you've read have probably been about the government shutdown and the launch of the Affordable Care Act . And I know that many of you have rightly never been more frustrated with Washington. But if you look beyond those headlines, there are some good things happening in our economy. And that's been my top priority since the day I walked into the Oval Office. After decades in which the middle class was working harder and harder just to keep up, and a punishing recession that made it worse, we made the tough choices required not just to recover from crisis, but to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. Five years later, we have fought our way back. Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months. Another 200,000 Americans went back to work last month. The American auto industry has come back with more than 350,000 new jobs --- jobs putting out and selling the high-tech, fuel-efficient cars the world wants to buy. And they're leading the charge in a business that has added jobs for the first time since the 1990s --- a big reason why our businesses sell more goods and services ""Made in America"" than ever before. We decided to stop our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we produce more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries. We decided to fix a broken health care system. And even though the task has been rough, so far, about 500,000 Americans gain health coverage starting January 1st. And by the way, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And one more thing: since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. And that makes it easier to invest in the things that create jobs --- education, research, and so on. Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together. Think about what we could do if the few didn't hold the economy hostage every few months, or waste time on dozens of votes to _ the Affordable Care Act rather than try to help us fix it. In the weeks ahead, I'll keep talking about my plan to build a better bargain for the middle class. Good jobs. A good education. A chance to buy a home, save, and retire. And yes, the financial security of affordable health care. And I'll look for any willing partners who want to help. Because of your hard work and tough sacrifices over the past five years, we're pointed in the right direction. But we've got more work to do to keep moving that way. And as long as I'm President, I'll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. Thanks, and have a great weekend."	['Cancelling the Affordable Care Act']
We can learn from the passage that Hand Made Events .	"Imagine a picnic dinner held at a location only made known hours before the meal, where guests are invited to decorate tables and chairs, bring their favorite dishes and wear white to reflect the simplicity of the event. This was the scene at a PopUp dinner held on June 13 in Brooklyn, New York's Prospect Park. PopUp dinners are popping up nationwide -- not just in Brooklyn. Garrett Sathre and his wife and business partner, Nicole Benjamin-Sathre are the team behind Hand Made Events and the creators and hosts of PopUp dinners. Sathre, a former restaurateur and head chef with Bubba's Diner and Kitchen 39, both located in the Bay Area, came up with the concept of the flash dinner after he was inspired by the annual Diner en Blanc held in Paris. In 2011, Hand Made Events used the power of social media to get the word out and soon, enough interest was attracted. In October 2011, it held its first flash dinner, calling the evening Le Diner a San Francisco at Golden Gate Park's outdoor Music Pavilion. He described it as a picnic dinner for 3,500 people.""I thought we would have anywhere between 300-500 people to attend. Two articles ran a week later about my crazy idea and we got 15,000 emails within three days,""Sathre said. After the success of the San Francisco dinner, Sathre decided to expand his""crazy idea""and hold dinners across the country in major markets such as Brooklyn, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Sathre says their Brooklyn PopUp on June 13 sold 5,000 tickets in just four days with 5,000 on the waiting list raising over $160,000 in ticket sales. Those are some big numbers. Hand Made Events partners with the Prospect Park Alliance and gives all of their proceeds to the non-profit group. In total, the Brooklyn PopUp dinner raised over $60,000 for the Prospect Park Alliance. Hand Made Events sees the same interest in their smaller city locations.""We have seen a 30 percent increase in our smaller markets -- Minneapolis, San Diego, Charleston, and Miami every year,""Sathre said. Hand Made Events has eight more dinners planned nationwide this year, and six already scheduled for next year. The popularity is not just here in the states. Sathre says he sees photos of other groups holding similar events everywhere through social media. Just last year, Hand Made Events helped a woman in Kenya plan her own flash dinner via Skype.""This event crosses and appeals to all cultures. There are not many events, if any, that bring all people together like the PopUp,""he said."	['has already held several dinners in some smaller cities']
"Owens got his other name""Jesse""when_."	"James Cleveland Owens was the son of a farmer and the grandson of black slaves:His family moved to Cleveland when he was 9.There,a school teacher asked the youth his name. ""J.C.""he replied. She thought he had said""Jesse"",and he had a new name. Owens ran his first race at age 13.After high school,he went to Ohio State University.He had to work part time so as to pay for his education.As a second-year student, in the Big Ten games in 1935,he set even more records than he would in the Olympic Games a year later. A week before the Big Ten meet, Owens accidentally fell down a flight of stairs.His back hurt so much that he could not exercise all week,and he had to be helped in and out of the car that drove him to the meet.He refused to listen to the suggestions that he give up and said he would try, event by event.He did try, and the results are in the record book . The stage was set for Owens' victory at the Olympic Games in Berlin the next year, and his success would come to be regarded as not only athletic but also political.Hitler did not congratulate any of the African American winners. ""It was all right with me,""he said years later.""I didn't go to Berlin to shake hands with him,anyway."" Having returned from Berlin,he received no telephone call from the president of his own country, either.In fact, he was not honored by the United States until 1976,four years before his death. Owens'Olympic victories made little difference to him.He earned his living by looking after a school playground,and accepted money to race against cars,trucks,motorcycles,and dogs. ""Sure,it bothered me,"" he said later.""But at least it was an honest living.I had to eat."" In time,however, his gold medals changed his life.""They have kept me alive over the years,"" he once said,""Time has stood still for me.That golden moment dies hard."""	"['""for""Jesse""']"
The main purpose of this passage is to _ .	Have you ever heard of e-waste(electric waste,), which can be produced every day? How do you deal with your computers, MP4 players and mobile phones when they're broken or you want a new one? Most people just throw them away. With the development of electric industry, e-waste pollution has become a serious problem. According to the United Nations, in 2014, people around the world produced 41.8 million tons of e-waste and only recycled 6.5 million tons. The US was the biggest waster, producing 7.1 million tons. China came second, with 6 million tons. It's important to pay attention to e-waste. It can either be valuable or harmful , depending on how we deal with it. E-waste is a valuable urban mine . The value of the metals, like gold and silver in the waste around the world, is amazing. And the metals can be reused. But if people throw them away, the toxic chemicals can get into the earth or air, effecting the environment and people's health. Apple, for example, now recycle people's used products in China when they are buying new ones. The company will test and repair the used ones and sell them at lower prices. To help reduce e-waste, we can also take computers and phones to see if companies offer recycling programs.	['advise people to deal with e-waste properly to reduce pollution.']
Jane wants to join the _ club.	Dear Grace, How are you? Thank you for your last e-mail. You want to know about my school clubs, right ? Well, it's time for us to join the school clubs now. There are many clubs in my school, like the English club, the art club, the music club and the sports club. I have two good friends, Jack and Lisa. We all want to join the school clubs.

What should you do with those who think they know all the answers according to the writer?	"One of the requirements of every graduation ceremony speaker is that they offer some advice. Well, get ready, here it comes. Soon you will be leaving the company of those who think they have all the answers -your professors, instructors and counselors-and going out into what we like to call the real world. In time you will meet up with other people who think they have all the answers. These people are called bosses. My advice is: humor them. A little later you'll meet additional people who think they have all the answers. These are called spouses . My advice is: humor them, too. And of all goes well, in a few years you will meet still another group of people who think they have all the answers. These are called children. Humor them. Life will go on, your children will grow up, go to school and someday they could be taking part in a graduation ceremony just like this one. And who knows, the speakers responsible for handing out good advice might be you. Halfway through your speech, the graduate sitting next to your daughter will lean over and ask, ""Who is that woman up there who thinks she has all the answers?"" Well, thanks to the reasonable advice you are hearing today and that I hope you will all pass on, she will be able to say, ""That is my mother. Humor her."""

The woman was holding up traffic because _ .	"You probably remember me from the other day. I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment. I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology. I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology. The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you ""have walked a mile in their shoes"" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry. Patience, as they say, is a virtue."	['she had cancer and was absent in mind']
We can infer that the writer wrote this passage mainly to _ .	"Visiting animals in their natural homes may sound like a great idea that helps to save them, but is it ? Researchers writing in Trends in Ecology & Evolution on Oct9 said that the interactions between wild animals and friendly eco-tourists who want to take their pictures may put animals at greater risk of being eaten. It is clear that many people visit protected areas every year. ""Recent data showed that protected areas around the globe have 8 billion visitors per year; that's like each human on Earth visited a protected area once a year, and then some!""said Dainel Blumstein of the University of California, Los Anglels. ""This amount of nature tourism and eco-tourism can be added to the long list of ways in which humans cause fast environmental change. The basic idea of the report the report is that humans change the ways animals act and those changes might affect other parts of their lives, according to Science Daily. Those changes in behavior and activity may put animals at risk. ""When animals spend time in 'harmless' ways with humans, they may let down their guard,"" Blumstein said. As animals get used to feeling comfortable with humans, they may become braver in other situations, he says . ""If this bravery continues when they meet real predators , then they will die more often when they meet them."" Eco-tourism is in some ways similar to making animals live in human homes or in cities. In all three cases, regular interactions between people and animals tame. Evidence has shown that silver foxes that live with people become more laid-back and less fearful; this results from evolutionary changes but also from spending time with humans. Simply put , as Blumstein asked in the Scientific American magazine:""Does eco-tourism make animals _ ?"" And that's not all - humans can also scare away natural predators , creating the so-called ""human shield effect"" and a safe environment for smaller animals that might make them braver, too. When humans are around, for example, vervet monkeys don't see as many leopards trying to eat them. Blumstein says they hope to do more research into humans' interactions with wildlife. Scientists will ""now have to understand better how different species and species in different situations react to humans and when humans might put them at risk."	['Wildlife tourism may seem helpful, but it can be deadly for some animals']
We can infer from the letter that Tom is _ .	79 Mayfair Road Plumton, Kent October 10th Dear Rosemary, I was very glad to get your letter this morning. I really ought to have written to you---it was my turn, I know----but I have been terribly busy. The children seem to take up all my time. I am thinking of sending Ann to a nursery school.

Which statement is true?	"Have you ever dreamed about a trip to the space? Seeds of some vegetables and crops are a lot luckier than you, as they have travelled to space and back. China is among the three countries in the world that carry out agricultural research in space. The others are Russia and the US. Since 1987, China has sent about 1,000 species of seeds into space. These include green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers , carrots, lettuce and wheat. Even on China's first manned spacecraft Shenzhou-V, there were some seeds from Taiwan. ""Conditions in outer space such as radiation and low gravity can cause big changes in the seeds,"" said Chinese researcher Jin Xing. But not all seeds are better after going to space. After returning to Earth, the best seeds are selected.These seeds produce much more and also grow faster than normal seeds. As the safety of genetically modified food is still being debated, some people doubt the safety of these ""space vegetables"" because some of their genes are changed during the trip to space. But Jin holds a more positive view. He said, ""unlike genetically modified crops, no new genes are introduced to the space vegetables, so they are definitely safe."" China has also been co-operating with NASA to grow some super size potatoes on the International Space Station. Special growth rooms use computers to control the light, temperature and humidity . Using this technology a new, virus-free potato can be produced every 40 to 50 days instead of the previous yearly crop."	"[""The space vegetables don't belong to genetically modified food to some extent.""]"
You can infer from the passage that to be a volunteer,	Do you want to work with people, animals or machines? Do you want to work indoors or outdoors, directly serve people in need or serve people behind the scenes? These are the typical questions that volunteer service agencies would ask. Every year, thousands of people in the west offer volunteer service. Volunteering greatly strengthens the community because it helps the old, the young, the weak, the sick, the disabled and the injured to overcome difficulties. Volunteers usually help in many different ways. They may give people advice, offer friendship to the young , drive the elderly to church, counsel kids against drugs, work as assistants in schools or nursing homes, raise funds, plant trees, help out in local libraries and do many other things. Volunteering can be a few hours a week or a few hours a month. Anybody who wants to serve people in need can become a volunteer. The art of volunteering is a process of both giving and receiving. Volunteering allows volunteers to meet new people, make new friends and mix with people from all walks of life. Volunteering is an excellent way to experiment,practice and try out new techniques and skills,discover your individual talents and explore career choice. Being a volunteer will take individuals on a wonderful journey and help them learn many important things beyond their school learning.	['you can get something valuable']
This passage is mainly about _ .	Paper cut can be seen in many parts of China during the Spring Festival. People put it on windows, doors and walls for the festival. A thousand years ago, paper cut was used for decoration . In Tang Dynasty women used paper cut as headdress. In Song Dynasty, it helped make gifts more beautiful. What's more, people would feel happier when they saw paper cut on windows, doors and walls. Now people use paper cut to express their wishes for welcoming the New Year. There are different kinds of paper cut in different parts of China. Pictures usually cover nearly all things, from flowers, birds to the famous people. Now, there are factories for paper cut in China. Paper cut has changed from decoration to a kind of art. At the same time, paper cut also appears in cartoons, magazines or TV programs.	['paper cut']
I collected old paving bricks _ .	I love collecting old paving bricks ( ). It is my favourite hobby. I started it last year when I needed to help our teacher to hold a fair display ( ) for our school. A few years earlier, I read an article about paving bricks in a fashion magazine. I found it was very interesting, so I decided to do the display on the bricks. But we didn't have so many bricks for a good display. Then I decided to go out and look for them. Now I have collected hundreds of bricks. Most of them are from Ohio ( ). Actually , there are more than one thousand different kinds of bricks in Ohio. Sometimes, I bought some old but special bricks on the Internet. The price is from 5 to 10 dollars for one brick. Sometimes, people can't understand why I buy bricks. I must say that it's my favourite hobby.	['A few years ago']
People enjoyed reading O. Henry's stories because _	O. Henry, a famous American writer of short stories, was born in North Carolina in 1862. O. Henry was a pen name. His real name was William Sydney Porter. When he was a young boy, he did not go to school for long because of being born in a poor family, but he tried to teach himself everything he needed to know. When he was about 20 years old, O. Henry went to Texas. There he tried different jobs. He first worked on a newspaper, and then had a job in a bank. But he got himself into some trouble. Some money went missing from the bank. O. Henry was believed to have stolen it, so he was sent to prison . During the three years in prison, he learned to write short stories. After he got out of prison, he went to New York and went on writing. He wrote mostly about New York and the life of the poor there. People liked his stories, because almost all of them finished with a sudden change. This made the readers surprised.	['they had surprising endings']
What does the story tell us?	"Sudha Chandran, a classical dancer from India, had to have her right leg cut after a car accident.She was also cut off on her bright career road. However, she didn't stop struggling. In the painful three months that followed, Sudha met a doctor who had an operation on her leg. So strongly she wanted to go back to dancing after she had been fitted with a man-made leg. Sudha knew that she believed in herself and could realize her dream,so she began her brave journey back to the world of dancing -- learning to balance, bend, stretch,walk, and turn. After every public recital , she might ask her dad about her performance. ""You stillhave a long way to go"" was the answer she used to get in return. In January 1984, Sudha gained popularity again by giving a public recital in Bombay. She performed in such a great manner that it moved everyone to tears and this performance pushed her to the number one position again. That evening when she asked her dad the same question, he didn't say anything. He just touched her feet as a praise. Sudha's comeback was so touching that a film producer decided to make the story into a film,which has moved more and more people. When someone asked Sudha how she had managed to dance again, she said quite simply, ""YOU DON'T NEED FEET TO DANCE."" Nothing is impossible in this world. If you have the will to win,you can achieve anything."	['Where there is a will, there is a way.']
Why was the little girl crying?	"A man stopped his car at the door of a flower shop. He planned to order flowers and asked the shopkeeper to deliver them to his mother, who was far away in the man's hometown. The man saw a little girl crying on the road when he was about to enter the shop. The man asked her: ""Why are you crying?"" ""I want to buy a rose for my mother, but I haven't got enough money,"" said the girl. The man took the girl's hand and entered the flower shop. He first ordered the bouquet for his mother and bought a rose for the girl. Walking out of the shop, the man asked the girl if she would like a ride home. ""Will you really drive me home?"" she asked. ""Of course,"" the man replied. ""Then drive me to my mother. But the place where my mother lives is very far."" The man drove along the mountain road and finally came to the cemetery . The little girl put the flower onto a new grave. In order to present a rose to her mother who had passed away a month before, she had gone on a very long journey. The man drove the girl to her home and then returned to the flower shop. He cancelled the bouquet and bought a big bunch of fresh flowers instead. He drove directly to his mother's home, a five-hour drive from where he was. He would present the flowers to his mother in person."	"[""She couldn't afford a rose.""]"
According to the article, both dog people and cat people _ .	"ARE you a dog person or a cat person? With so many photos and videos of cats and dogs doing cute things online, it's easier than ever to answer which of these furry friends you like more. There are many reasons why people prefer one type of pet over the other. So, have you ever wondered what your preference for cats or dogs says about you? In fact, a 2010 study done by Sam Gosling , a psychologist at the University of Texas, US, and his graduate student Carson Sandy found that dog people are more extroverted agreeable and serious than cat people. ""Cats will occasionally engage in social activities, but usually after only a few minutes they will abandon the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown lull, for hours at a lime,"" said Modem Dog magazine. Just on the basis of dogs' nature being more sociable than cats', you may expect that the personalities of dog people also reflect higher sociability. And Cosling's study found that dog people are generally about 15 percent more extroverted and 13 percent more agreeable, both of which are associated with social altitude. In addition, dog people are 11 percent more conscientious than cat people. ""Conscientiousness"" is a tendency In show self-discipline ,to complete tasks and aim for achievement. This quality also shows a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior. In comparison, cat people an; about 12 percent more anxious, but they are also 11 percent more ""open"" than dog people, due to a general appreciation for art, emotion, imagination, curiosity, adventure, unusual ideas and variety of experience. And people high on openness are more likely to hold unconventional beliefs. Despite vast differences, there an some things that cat people and dog people have in common. ""Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing and generally optimists. "" noted Mother Nature Network."	['are usually positive and care about nature']
What do many people go to school for?	Many people go to school for a good education. They learn languages, history, maths and other lessons. School education is very important and useful. Yet no one can learn everything from school. No matter how much a teacher knows, he cannot teach his students everything they want to know. His work is to show his students how to learn. He teaches them how to read and how to think. So, much more is to be learned outside school by the students themselves. It is always more important to know how to study by oneself. It is quite easy to learn something in a language or a formula in maths,but it is difficult to use a formula in finding the answer to a maths problem . Great inventors do not get everything from school but they can invent many things and change the world a lot. Though Thomas Edison invented many things he didn't have much school education. How do they do all these? Because they know how to study. A lot of things are not taught in the classroom. They get knowledge from books outside school. They work hard all their lives, and the most important thing is that they know how to use their head.	['To get a good education']
Which of the following is NOT mentioned by the speaker?	"""This past year has been one of great celebration for many. The enthusiasm which greeted the Diamond Jubilee was, of course, especially memorable for me and my family. It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions. On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing over the elements. That same spirit was also in evidence from the moment the Olympic flame arrived on these shores. The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service. As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama. We were reminded, too, that the success of these great festivals depended to an enormous degree upon the dedication and effort of an army of volunteers. Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted. For many, Christmas is also a time for coming together. But for others, service will come first. Those serving in our armed forces, in our emergency services and in our hospitals, whose sense of duty takes them away from family and friends, will be missing those they love. At Christmas I am always struck by how the spirit of togetherness lies also at the heart of the Christmas story. A young mother and a dutiful father with their baby were joined by poor shepherds and visitors from afar. They came with their gifts to worship the Christ child. From that day on he has inspired people to commit themselves to the best interests of others. This is the time of year when we remember that God sent his only son 'to serve, not to be served'. He restored love and service to the centre of our lives in the person of Jesus Christ. It is my prayer this Christmas Day that his example and teaching will continue to bring people together to give the best of themselves in the service of others. I wish you all a very happy Christmas.

What's the purpose in checking others' progress?	Few of us act alone in the real world. Most things are done with the help or ideas of other people. Group projects are great practice for high school, college, and real life, when you will probably have a job that requires working with others. Right now, group projects can be fun and they often allow you to do a bigger, more interesting project than you could alone. With group work, you can actually learn more in less time. Group projects also give you a chance to get to know kids you might not otherwise know or talk with. Group projects are also a great way to practice skills you're not so sure of. For example: working on a deadline, staying organized, or being patient. And if you're a little nervous talking in front of a group, a joint project can help you become more comfortable with it. Maybe your group will pick you to tell the whole class about your project. If so, you'll know your whole group is _ you! One of the most important things about group work is talking and meeting together. It's a good idea to continually check with everybody on their progress to see if anyone needs help. You might think the first step is to figure out who will do what, but actually it's getting to know another a little. Take a few minutes to chat. Even if you know each other well, it can help to take a minute to think about your skills and share your strengths and weaknesses. The second step is to go over ground rules from your teacher and any that you want to create together as a group.	['To help them when they need help.']
Which of the following can be put into the blank behind 2?	Did you ever think someone was scary because they looked different or ate strange food? Well, they might think the same about you! One of the things we all need to do is to _ variety.We shouldn't think badly of people from other cultures because they behave differently from us. Sometimes we treat people from other countries unfairly, because one person from that culture did something bad.Well, has your class ever been punished just because a few kids were causing trouble? Has your whole family ever been blamed for something your little sister did? It doesn't seem fair, does it? It's just equally unfair to blame a whole culture for what two or three people have done. So here are some things that you can do to help yourself understand other cultures: 1Find common ground! Just remember that even though some people look different on the outside, that doesn't change how they are on the inside.They still have the exact same feelings! 2 _ Because someone from another culture has been mean to you, you decide to avoid everyone from that culture.Well think about it.Why are you blaming them for something they didn't have anything to do with? Put yourself in their shoes.How would you feel? Putting yourself inside someone else's head can be a very powerful way to understand WHY they are acting the way they are. 3Try to make friends with people from other cultures! You could ask them about their culture, or what it is like in their country, if they can remember, or if they have ever lived there.Try foods from their culture, or ask them about words in their language.You might be surprised at how interesting other cultures can be! You can join great discussion groups, participate in projects, and have lots of fun doing new things. 4Be aware that you've judged other people If you know what you have done, it helps to make things better.Pay attention to what you think about other people.It helps.

I think about our elementary-school friendship, but some memories have blurred .What happened that day in the fifth grade when Beth suddenly stopped speaking to me? Does she know that I've been thinking about her for seven years? If only we could go back, discover what ended our relationship. I have to speak with Beth. I see her sometimes, and find out school is ""fine"". It's not the same. It never will be. Someone says that she's Liz now. What happened to Beth? I can't call her. Should I write?

The purpose of staying right walking form is _ .	Many people think walking is a good way to exercise and many fat people are advised to lose weight by walking. In fact, you can do it everywhere. Here's how to prepare for walking: ^Find a pair of shoes. It is easy to find a pair of shoes, but what matters most is comfort. ^Check your shape. The following tips will help you stay comfortable and get the most out of your walk: * Stand up straight. Imagine a string pulling you up from the center of the top of your head. Let that string pull you up as straight as possible. Relax your shoulders. * Look ahead. Keep your neck straight and your head held high to avoid unnecessary strain to your neck and shoulders. If you have to look down to see where you're going, lower your eyes, not your head. * Move your arms. Bend your elbows and let your arms swing naturally at your sides. You'll burn up to 15 percent more calories by keeping your arms moving. ^Stay safe walking is one of the safest activities you can do. Still, it's wise to take a few precautions . * If you're walking at night, wear a piece of reflective clothing. * When the weather's warm, be sure to drink a tall glass of water before you set out and another when you return. * If your path is rough, protect your ankles. Wear a comfortable elastic bandage for support, and keep your eyes focused on the path.	['to make full use of walk']

"Why does the author use the example of a couple who tried to name their baby ""@""?"	"Does technology pose a threat to the purity of Chinese language? Many Chinese use instant messenger tools such as MSN or QQ, listen to music on MP3 players and log on the Internet using ADSL--most without knowing the literal Chinese translation of the abbreviations . But they don't have to, as many English letters have become part of the local vocabulary. A dozen abbreviations including GDP, NBA, IT, MP3, QQ, DVD and CEO are among the 5,000 most-frequently used words in the Chinese media last year, according to a report on the 2006 Language Situation in China. The report said some parents are so keen on English letters that a couple tried to name their baby ""@"", claiming the character used in email addresses reflects their love for the child. While the ""@""is obviously familiar to Chinese e-mail users, they often use the English word ""at"" to pronounce it ""ai ta"",or ""love him"". The study collected more than 1 billion language samples from newspapers, magazines, TV, radio and websites. The annual report is jointly compiled by the Ministry of Education and the State Language Commission. ""Nowadays, more and more English abbreviations are being used in Chinese, making them an important part of modern language,"" said Hou Min, a professor at Communication University of China. ""The abbreviations have gained popularity because of the ease of usage,"" Hou said. For example, DNA is much simpler to use than its Chinese version. ""As more Chinese people learn foreign languages, especially English, in recent years, using abbreviations has become a trend among educated people,"" she added. Some language scholars fear such usage will contaminate the purity of Chinese and cause confusion in communication."	['To show some people are very enthusiastic over English letters.']
According to the passage, the following are the benefits of later school start time EXCLUDING _ .	"Dozens of school districts around the country have been looking at these studies and are considering ways to adjust their class schedules. Eric Peterson is head of St. George's School, a private boarding school for grades 9-12 in the northeastern state of Rhode Island. After looking at the medical research on adolescent sleep needs and observing students in his own school, Peterson consulted with Dr. Judy Owen, a famous pediatrician and sleep expert. Armed with what he considered to be convincing data, Peterson decided to change his school's start time from 8:00 am to 8:30 am on a trial basis to see if a 30-minute change would make a difference. He was surprised by the results. ""What was really astonishing was how many benefits and how significant the benefits were,"" he says. ""In the research itself, we saw just over a 50 percent decrease in health-center admissions for fatigue, or fatigue-related illness, or rest requests. We saw almost a 35 percent decrease in first-period lateness. Students reported that they were more attentive. They were less sleepy during the day."" And, according to Dr. Patricia Moss, assistant dean for Academic Affairs at St. George's School, students weren't the only ones reporting better results in the classroom. She says virtually all the teachers almost immediately noticed much more concentrated in the classroom, and there was definitely a more positive mood all around. ""Kids were happier to be there at 8:30 than they were at 8:00,"" she says. ""So our experience across the total spectrum was, universally, extremely positive and surprisingly so."" Headmaster Peterson says there was another unexpected area of change when the school changed its start time. ""We saw probably a greater than 30 percent increase in student attendance at breakfast, and of the food that they were eating. We ate more than doubled the amount of milk, eggs, fruit and cereal. So it was quality breakfast foods that the kids were eating. So they were better fueled as well as better rested."" Ross and Peterson acknowledge that making schedule changes has been easier at a small, private boarding school than it might be for the larger U.S. public school system. But they are hopeful that others will find a way. ""In the end,"" says Peterson, ""schools ought to do what's the right thing for their students, first and foremost, and this element of the program is very clear--certain for us as a school--but I think as a general example to other schools, is pretty convincing, and so I would argue that it's worth doing."""

Which of the following statements can be supported by the passage?	The bumpy structure of walnuts is similar to the brain.Some Chinese believe eating walnuts will make them smarter because of that.By the same logic,they believe eating pig brains will increase their intelligence.This kind of food myth is true to Americans,too. Some Americans regularly eat uncooked eggs to keep their minds sharp. Most doctors don't recommend eating either raw eggs or animal brains.Then, what food is good for your brain? Scientists have found a relationship between diet and a healthy brain.It's becoming pretty clear that the right food can increase brain power--help you pay attention, keep you motivated,improve memory, and _ stress.Perhaps even prevent brain aging. The health of your brain depends not only on how much(or little)fat you eat but on what kind it is.Intellectual performance requires the specific type of fat found most commonly in certain fish.Besides oily fish,you should introduce lots of dark green leafy vegetables and color1ful fruits into your diet.Most people lack the special vitamins that these brain foods provide. But you won't do well on your test just because you ate fish the night before. You must eat brain foods regularly.	['Neither walnuts nor animal brains really help increase mental power.']

One day Mouse ran through the jungle and tripped over Lion's huge paws. Lion woke up with a start. ""How dare you wake me up! "" he shouted angrily. Lion grabbed Mouse with one paw. ""On the second thought, I'm in the mood for the snack, and you'll make a delicious meal."", he said. Mouse cried out, ""King Lion, please spare me! If you let me live, I'll always remember your kindness. And, some day, I might be able to help you."" "" How could such a powerless little mouse ever help me?"" That thought made Lion laugh so much that he decided to let Mouse go. A week later, Lion was walking through the jungle on the way to his favourite tree when he stepped onto a hunter's net. The net scooped him up. No matter how he twisted and turned, he couldn't escape. When Mouse heard Lion's frightened shouts, he raced to help. Mouse quickly chewed through the ropes to make a hole in the net. Soon, Lion moved out and was free. Lion looked down at the little mouse. ""Thank you for saving my life,"" said Lion, smiling his widest smile. ""I was mistaken. You are not a powerless little mouse. You are a great friend!"""	['Even the small can show great strength.']
According to Patrick Kingsley, people are stupider partly because of _ .	"Speed-reading is a necessary skill in the Internet age.We skim over articles, e-mails and WeChat to try to grasp key words and the essential meaning of a certain text.Surrounded with information from our electronic devices, it would be impossible to cope if we read word by word, line by line.But a new trend calls on people to unplug and enjoy reading slowly, listing benefits beyond the intelligent stimulation. A recent story from The Wall Street Journal reported on a book club in Wellington, New Zealand, where members meet in a cafe and turn off their smartphones.They sink into cozy chairs and read in silence for an hour. Unlike traditional book clubs, the point of the slow reading club isn't exchanging ideas about a certain book, but to get away from electronic devices and read in a quiet, relaxed environment. According to the Journal, the Wellington book club is just one example of a movement started by book lovers who miss the old-fashioned way of reading before the Internet and smartphones. Slow readers, such as The Atlantic's Maura Kelly, say a regular reading habit sharpens the mind, improves concentration, reduces stress levels and deepens the ability to sympathize. Another study published last year in Science showed that reading novels helps people understand other's mental states and beliefs, a fundamental skill in building relationships. Yet technology has made us less attentive readers. Screens have changed our reading patterns from the straight and information.left-to-right sequence to a wild skimming and skipping pattern as we hunt for important words and information. Reading text punctuated with links leads to weaker comprehension than reading plain text. The Internet may have made us stupider, says Patrick Kingsley from The Guardian. Because of the Internet, he says, we have become very good at collecting a wide range of interesting news, but we are also gradually forgetting how to sit back, reflect, and relate all these facts to each other. Slow reading means a return to an uninterrupted, straight pattern, in a quiet environment free of distractions. Aim for 30 minutes a day, advises Kelly from The Atlantic. ""You can squeeze in that half hour pretty easily if only during your free moments, you pick up a meaningful work of literature,"" Kelly said. ""Reach for your e-reader, if you like. Kindles make books like War and Peace less heavy, not less substantive, and also ensure you'll never lose your place."""	['the lack of reflection']
According to text, an owl's eyes _ .	"Owls are some of the world's greatest hunters. From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine ""hairs"" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear."

What is the purpose of the experiment in which newborn babies heard the stories?	Not long ago, people thought babies were not able to learn things until they were five or six months old. Yet doctors in the United States say babies begin learning on their first day of life. Scientists note that babies are strongly influenced by their environment. They say a baby will smile if her mother does something the baby likes. A baby learns to get the best care possible by smiling to please her mother or other caregiver. This is how babies learn to connect and communicate with other human beings. One study shows that babies can learn before they are born. The researchers placed a tape recorder on the stomach of a pregnant woman. Then, they played a recording of a short story. On the day the baby was born, the researchers attempted to find if he knew the sounds of the story repeated while in his mother. They did this by placing a device in the mouth of the newborn baby. The baby would hear the story if he moved his mouth one way. If the baby moved his mouth the other way, he would hear a different story. The researchers say the baby clearly liked the story he heard before he was born. They say the baby would move his mouth so he could hear the story again and again. Another study shows how mothers can strongly influence social development and language skills in their children. Researchers studied the children from the age of one month to three years. The researchers attempted to measure the sensitivity of the mothers. The women were considered sensitive if they supported their children's activities and did not interfere unnecessarily. They tested the children for thinking and language development when they were three years old. Also, the researchers observed the women for signs of depression. The children of depressed women did not do as well in tests as the children of women who did not suffer from depression. The children of depressed women did poorly in tests of language skills and understanding what they hear. These children also were less cooperative and had more problems dealing with other people. The researchers noted that the sensitivity of the mothers was important to the intelligence development of their children. Children did better when their mothers were caring, even when they suffered from depression.	['To prove that babies can learn before they are born.']
Japanese hair straightening caused a problem for the writer that_.	"For years I fought with the bird's nest that sat on top of my head-my Medusa hair.No matter what I did and how hard I tried, in no way could I make my unruly hair to my satisfaction. Growing up in a Russian-Jewish home with parents who thought North American styling products were something illegal such as drugs, I was never allowed to put them in my hair. ""Why buy hair gel? Your hair is so beautiful naturally."" my mother would say.The teens at school did not agree.From boys' not wanting to kiss me when we played spin the bottle in Grade 7 to being called the mop, I suffered from my hair. When I got to university, I believed my hair was a wall that stood between me and everything---finding a part-time job, getting a boyfriend, etc. If only I could find a way to manage the curls and put it behind bars, I told myself, I would feel secure and sexy.I tried everything: rollers, hairspray, gels and, at one point, an iron.Then, in my second year, a miracle happened.I was asked to be a hair model for Japanese hair straightening, a process by which the molecules of my curls would be broken and reset in a bone-straight position.I was the perfect candidate, the hairdresser told me.Although they said how hair relaxing could damage the scalp , for the next five years I didn't find them to be true. All of the hairdresser's promises were fulfilled: With my hair straight and smooth, I was no longer the "" mop"". However, there was extreme damage done to my wallet. To keep up the straightening cost $ 700 every six months, and that was considered cheap. While some people thought I was crazy, I was willing to do anything to never again feel like that anxious, curly-headed girl in Grade 7.But when I moved out of my parents' house at age 26 and rented an apartment, the upkeep of my new image became too costly. I couldn't hide from my inner Medusa any longer.It was time to hug her and let her fly.Seeking a choice, I turned to the Internet, Google.After hours of searching, I hit upon a ""curly haired"" salon, a place designed for girls like me. I doubted these so-called ""Curl Ambassadors"" could do anything without using machine of some sort, and though I bought the service called the ""Curly-Doo"", I suspected I'd have the same unruly mop at the end of the appointment. I dragged my feet so hard getting there that I arrived 45 minutes late.I secretly hoped they would turn me away.Instead, my stylist simply said: ""You are very late.Let me see your hair"". At that moment, my world and beliefs about myself were turned upside down along with my hair. As my head was in a basin full of freezing-cold water, then covered with a jelly-like jam, I wondered what I had got myself into. ""Do you really think this will work?"" I asked the stylist, Jones."" My curls are a disaster."" ""No curly hair is hopeless,"" she replied.""They just haven't found a way to work with it, that's all."" After the hour was over, Jones had completed her work.She had styled my hair using only her hands, water and a mixture of organic jam.I couldn't believe what I was seeing in the mirror: a naturally curly, Medusa-free me.You could argue that hair is just hair. Yet, it is just such physical features that have such a large influence on how we view ourselves. According to Jones,75 percent of the population have a wave or curl in their hair and don't know what to do with it.Men cut theirs short.Women flat-iron theirs to death.When I read through a beauty magazine or take the subway to work, it makes me sad to see so many people repressing their natural beauty. Since then, my world has changed.I have always been outgoing, but these days I seem to be more outspoken and confident than ever.On top of that, friends and co-workers tell me I am looking better than ever, but they don't know the source of the change. I don't need to tell them. My Medusa hair speaks for herself."	['the cost to keep her hair straight was too high for her']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Dear Editor: I have been reading your newspaper, the Hometown Gazette, for the past two years, ever since I moved to Smithville because of my work. We moved here from New York City, so I am used to reading excellent newspapers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times. In fact, we still have the Times delivered on Sundays. All the members of my family enjoy reading the recipes in the magazine, as well as the Styles section. My children are crazy about their sports section. The Times is great, but the Gazette is another story. I've never read an article that doesn't contain at least three or four spelling or grammatical errors. For example, in last week's issue, you misspelled the word ""secretary"", used a singular verb with a plural noun, and used ""it's"" as a possessive . And that was just in the lead story! In case you never went to elementary school, ""it's"" means ""it is"". It's not a possessive pronoun! In another case, the re-port you gave on an event was completely different from other newspapers. I didn't know what the reason was. It's a pity that this city, Smithville, Wisconsin, has only one newspaper, because I'd like to have an alternative to the newspaper you publish. I find it hard to believe your news stories. If you can't spell correctly, how can you get your facts right? I've been meaning to get this off my chest for some time. Please cancel my subscription . And buy your-self a dictionary. Sincerely, Jane Z. Jones"	['The editors of the Gazette might not treat the work seriously.']
Which is the best title of the story?	"One day, I happened to talk to a stranger on the bus. When he found out that I was from Chicago, he told me that one of his good friends lived there and he wondered if I happened to know him. At first I wanted to say that it was foolish to think like that, for from all the millions of people in Chicago, I could not possibly know his friend. But, instead, I just smiled and said that Chicago was a very big city. He was quiet for a few minutes, and then he began to tell me all about his friend. He told me that his friend was an excellent tennis player and that he even had his own tennis court . He added that he knew a lot of people with swimming pools, but that he only knew two people in the country who had their own tennis courts. And his friend in Chicago was one of them. I told him that I knew several people like that, for example, my brother and my next-door neighbor. I told him that my brother was a doctor and he lived in California. Then he asked where my brother lived in California. When I said Sacramento, he said that last year his friend spent the summer in Sacramento and lived next door to a doctor. The doctor had a tennis court. I said that my next-door went to Sacramento last summer and lived in the house next to my brother's. For a moment, we looked at each other, but we did not say anything. ""Would your friend's name happen to be Roland Kirkwood?"" I asked finally. He laughed and said, ""Would your brother's name happen to be Dr. Ray Hunter?"" It was my turn to laugh."

Chris Urmson mentioned his 11yearold son in order to show that _ .	"I passed my driving test at the fourth attempt. You might think that means I'm not as safe as someone who passed on their first attempt. But would you feel safer with no driver at all? Maybe not, and that's why automotive firms have included driverassist functions in their driverless cars. This allows the human driver to take over if there is a problem. Google is one producer that has prototype driverless cars. These cars have been newly equipped with autosteering wheels and conventional controls to allow normal driving. But this is just a stage -- the vision is to have fully automated cars very soon. The director of Google's selfdrive project, Chris Urmson, hopes his 11yearold son will never have to take a driving test. To achieve that, the cars need to be on the roads in five years. He says driverless cars will greatly reduce accidents and traffic jams. According to Chris, about 1.2 million people are killed on the roads around the world each year. That number is equivalent to a jet falling out of the sky every day. He thinks gradual changes to existing car designs are not enough to deal with the problems. ""If we are really going to make changes to our cities, get rid of parking lots, we need selfdrive cars,"" he says. Google's prototypes have covered over a million kilometers on the road. They have also had to deal with unexpected situations, such as a child driving a toy car in the road, and a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck. In each case, the car reacted safely. Some are not convinced. Sven Beiker of Stanford University thinks driverless cars will still need human input in extreme circumstances."	['driverless cars will come soon']

The author may most probably agree that physical punishment is _ .	Teenage boys, regardless of race, are more likely to die from gunshot wounds than from all natural causes combined. By the time the average American child leaves primary school, he or she will witness 8,000 murders and more than 100,000 acts of violence on television. Youth are becoming involved in violence at an alarming rate. In fact, the young arrest rate for murder doubled, from 6 arrests per 100,000 youth aged from 10 to 17 to over 12 per 100,000. For the many youth who have not been directly exposed to violence in their own communities, the entertainment media (television, movies, music and video games) provides many opportunities for children to see and hear violent exchanges. Research shows that there are about 5~6 violent acts per hour on prime time and 20~25 violent acts on Saturday morning children's programming. In its report, the American Psychological Association (APA) reported that viewing violence on television hurts children in many ways. In particular, the APA concludes that children may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others, be more fearful of the world around them, be more likely to behave in aggressive or harmful ways to- ward others, and gradually accept violence as a way to solve problems. Another form of violence involving youth is physical punishment in the schools. This form of discipline still remains legally supported in 23 nations in America. The Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education reported that 555,000 students were physically punished in the schools during this school year. Although such punishment has been regarded as an effective method of discipline by those who apply it, the findings are obvious that physical punishment does not work and that children who are victims of physical punishment are subject to potential long-term physical and emotional damage.

What is the best title of the passage?	"Some problems are difficult to solve. But there are a lot of number expressions that can help. For example, if we put two and two together, we might come up with the right answer. We know that two heads are better than one. It is always better to work with another person to solve a problem. Some problems have only one solution. You cannot be of two minds over this. But with any luck,we can solve the problem in two shakes of a lamb's tail. In other words,we could have our answers quickly and easily. Sometimes we can kill two birds with one stone. That is, we can complete two goals with only one effort or action. But we must remember that two wrongs don't make a right. If someone does something bad to you, you should not do the same to him. If you are going out with your girlfriend,or boyfriend,but you don't want another friend to go along on your date,you can just say to your friend: two's company, three's a crowd. When I was a young child in school, I had to learn the three R' s. These important skills are reading, writing and arithmetic. These three words do not all start with the letter ""R"". But they have the sound of ""R"". My teacher used to give three cheers when I did well in maths. They gave praise and approval for a job well done. Some of my friends were confused and did not understand their school work. They were at sixes and sevens. In fact, they did not care if they finished high school. But they were happy when they completed their studies and graduated from high school. They were in seventh heaven. They were on cloud nine. Nine times out of ten students who do well in school find good jobs. Some work in an office doing the same things every day at nine-to-five jobs. You do not have to dress to the nines, or wear your best clothes, for this kind of work."	['Interesting Number Expressions']
According to the passage, the new study _ .	"A new study has found some secrets of people's understanding of large numbers. Researchers studied a group of people who were born deaf and never learned any spoken language or a formal sign language, but they have developed a gesture system to communicate with people around them. The gestures let them express approximate amounts, but not exact numbers. ""Up to three, they're fine,"" says Elizabet Spaepen, a researcher at the University of Chicago and an author of the study. ""But past three, they start to fall apart."" In one test, Spaepen would knock her fist against a study participant's fist a certain number of times and then ask them to respond with the same number of knocks. ""If I were to knock four times on their fist, they might knock on my fist five times,"" she says. The finding offers a clue to just how much language affects our understanding of numbers. That has been a big question since 2004, when other researchers published data on two tribes in the Amazon whose members also lack words for big numbers. ""What they have are words that mean one and two,"" Spaepen says, ""and then they have a word to mean many."" Members of the Amazonian tribes also had trouble matching numbers larger than three or four. But some scholars felt that these earlier studies failed to prove that language was the reason. They pointed out that the tribes lived in groups that didn't use money and had no need for exact numbers. The new research appears to answer that criticism. ""It proves that the kinds of problems in understanding numbers that we found in the Amazonian tribes are not due to just the cultural or environmental circumstances,"" says Peter Gordon of Columbia University, one of the researchers involved in the earlier studies."	['has shown that our understanding of numbers is influenced by our mastering of language.']
Which feeling is NOT included in the laughter when the Englishman dropped a plate?	"In an American classroom, a teacher asked a Chinese girl to answer a question. She stood up and smiled, without making any sound. The American teacher looked at himself and didn't see anything funny. So he asked her the question again.The girl just smiled but said nothing. The teacher was angry. He didn't know that the girl smiled to cover her embarrassment because she didn't know how to answer the question. In a dining room in Beijing, an Englishman was careless and dropped a plate. The Chinese who saw this began to laugh. The Englishman felt uncomfortable and even got angry.""They are laughing at me,"" he thought. In fact ,the Chinese laughed not at the Englishman or his bad luck---whether he is a foreigner or a Chinese. The laughter has some feelings, don't take it so seriously ;laugh it off, it's nothing;such things can happen to any of us,etc."	['Bad luck!']
"What does the sentence ""Never tell yourself that you have a bad memory"" mean?"	"The human brain weighs about 1.4 kilograms, but it can, hold much more information than most computers. However, there is another difference between humans and computers. Computers don't forget information they are given, but humans often do. No one remembers everything, and luckily we don't usually have to. But everyone can improve their memory if they want to. Here are some suggestions. * Try to use new information immediately. For example, if you meet someone who says ""Hi! I'm Carlos,"" don't just say ""Hello."" Repeat the person's name. Say"" _ "" * Break a big number into smaller parts. For example, it's hard to memorize 109244153. But if you break it into three parts--109/244/153--it becomes easier. *Write out what you need to remember over and over again. This will help you keep it in mind longer, especially for memorizing formulas or facts. *Always review information. If you bring what you've learned back to your mind, they become easier to remember. For example, before you go to sleep, it's a good idea to review the new things you learned that clay. * Discuss with a friend. It is always easier to remember things through discussions. You can have a discussion about what's right and what's wrong, and it will lead to the right answer. *Never tell yourself that you have a bad memory. You can always do something to help improve your memory. And everyone's memory gets better if they use it often enough. All of the suggestions are helpful. If you follow them, you are certain to improve your memory."	['You should be confident in your memory ability.']
When did the worker first arrive in this town ?	"The worker I hired to repair my house had just finished a difficult first day on the job. A broken wheel made him an hour late; his ladder( )fell down when he was painting the roof and now his old truck wouldn't start. With each problem he shouted angrily more at himself than at his things. As I drove him home, the man didn't say a word. I tried talking to the man to kill time. I managed to find out that he had come up from Blue Hills in Victoria with his family six months ago to find a job. This was his first job since moving here. I now knew why his price was lower than any other worker I could find in the local newspaper. He really needed the job. His clothes told me as much. On arriving, much to my surprise, he invited me to meet his family. As we walked through his front garden he suddenly stopped at a small tree and placed his hands on it. Then , when he opened the door he completely changed. Instead of his troubled face, there was now a warm smile, hugs for his two children and a kiss for his wife. The following day, I asked him about the tree. ""That's my trouble tree,"" he answered. ""Work troubles aren't welcome at home with my wife and children. So I hang them on that tree every night when I come home. Then in the morning I pick them up again."" ""And you know what else?"" he said smiling, ""The next morning I find that there aren't as many as I remember hanging up the night before."""	['Six months ago.']
According to the passage, _ work at the fair.	I love to tell the story about how I met my best friend---- Tiger. We met at the school fair. Each year, all the fourth-grade classes hold a school fair. Everyone in the fourth-grade works at the fair. Some sell ice cream, drinks and snacks. Others take care of the little children who ride the rides. I got the second job and I've never regretted it, because that's where I met Tiger. My job was to help little children get on the back of a little horse. I kept telling the children to wait their turn and holding ice cream for them while they rode about. One thing was clear to me. I was growing older and should be more responsible. Suddenly, a boy came to the horse. He took the little horse's reins! The horse stopped, and the girl on its back started to fall. I was trying to reach the girl when I saw Tiger go by my legs. It held the horse's reins and pulled the horse away from my legs. I caught the girl just before we both hit the ground. The girl sat on top of me. She was laughing at the ice cream on my face. The horse's reins were in Tiger's mouth! Thanks to Tiger's fast action, I saved the little girl. We were both heroes. And Tiger, the fastest dog I've even known became my new best friend.

What should you do to put yourself in a good mood?	Have you ever noticed that the more you have the more you want? Let's face it. Thinking our life is good enough doesn't come naturally to many people. When we have high expectations of everything in life we will run into disappointment. Only when we are aware that needs are different from desires can we live with satisfaction. Here are a few ideas to help you be happier with what you have and who you are. Focus on what you are thankful for. Most people want things to be better than they are, or when things are going well, we forget to appreciate what we have. Learn to reflect on how much better things are than they could be. Focus on what you are thankful for. Write down 5 things you are grateful for right now. When we hold onto regrets from decisions we have made, it can really poison our well-being. Many people regret something they can no longer change, which ends up holding them back from moving forward in a more positive manner. What happened in the past is done and gone, so work to stay present and be mindful of the current moment to find more joy and fulfillment. When we use other people as the measuring stick for our personal success and quality of life we are likely to be less satisfied. Social comparisons can provide useful information when we try to learn from others, but they also hold our perspective in a discontented position. Compare yourself less with others so you can be satisfied more. When you are focused on your big ambitions and future goals you might _ the daily pleasures that surround you. Learn to slow down and absorb the wonder and beauty around you. Stay present and focus on the task you're undertaking at the moment. Don't let the life pass you by because you're always on the go and distracted by ambition. Practice looking at life through the lens of contentment and it will become more natural.	['Make time for simple pleasures.']
Why do people choose online education?	For many businessmen online education has been a dream. Now it has come true. The investment in higher education, whether financial or in terms of time, has long been impossible for many of them. But well-known educational institutions have chosen to deliver an internet-based program, and these barriers have been lifted. That is good news for people eager to improve themselves and is more attractive to employers. It is also a benefit to industry with better qualified candidates applying for jobs at every level. Having the benefits of a higher qualification without going to the university campus is attractive to many students. Campus study means greater cost, while online programs are flexible and save time, whether at home or at work. Students can achieve their degrees without causing too much _ to their career or home life. In addition to affordable, flexible classes and greater convenience, students also have access to the online learning resources of many of the world's top educational institutions. They can also communicate with their tutors no matter what time it is or whether either party is away for any reason. This has opened up the possibility of getting a qualification from a university or college that many students could only have dreamed of in the past. It also allows specialists to get the precise qualifications and focus on their studies. As well as seeing the increase of applicants from lower-incomes and housewives, studying online in the US is even becoming popular with younger people of college age. Employers have become increasingly welcome and positive to online qualifications as more candidates earn them, especially if they're properly approved by the US Department of Education. US institutions have led the way in online education provision. Many top US colleges and universities offer a range of online programs that are highly respected and in every way perfectly fit for adults who need to combine their studies with a working life.

Seeing a baby, the old people get excited because _ .	"Until late in the 20th century, most Americans spent time with people of generations. Now mid-aged Americans may not keep in touch with old people until they are old themselves.That's because we group people by age. We put our three-year-olds together in day-care center, our 13-year-olds in school and sports activities, and our 80-year-olds in senior-citizen homes. Why? We live away from the old for many reasons: young people sometimes avoid the old to get rid of fears for aging and dying. It is much harder to watch .someone we love disappear before our eyes. Sometimes it's so hard that we stay away from the people who need us most. Fortunately, .some of us have found our way to the old. And we have discovered that they often save the young. A reporter moved her family onto a block filled with old people. At first her children were disappointed. But the reporter baked banana bread for the neighbours and had her children deliver it and visit. Soon the children had many new friends, with whom they shared food, stories and projects. ""My children have never been less lonely,"" the reporter said. The young, in turn, save the old. Once I was in a rest home when a visitor showed up with a baby. She was immediately surrounded. People who hadn't gotten out of bed in a week suddenly were ringing for a wheelchair. Even those who had seemed asleep wake up to watch the child. Babies have an astonishing power to comfort and cure. Grandparents are a special case. They give grandchildren a feeling of security and continuity. As my husband put it, ""my grandparents gave me a deep sense that things would turn out right in the end."" Grandchildren speak of attention they don't get from worried parents. ""My parents were always telling me to hurry up, and my grandparents told me to slow down,"" one friend said. A teacher told me she can tell which pupils have relationships with grandparents: they are quieter, calmer, more trusting."	['the baby brought them the image of life']
Which is the main idea of the passage?	Technology is the application of knowledge to production. Thanks to modern technology, we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency of our work force. New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animal breeding techniques, and has made our life span longer via medical technology. Will mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure, the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends on research and development, and the latest surveys show that the united States is continuing to put billions of dollars annually into such efforts. So while we are running out of some limited resources, we may well find technological substitutes for many of them through our research programs. Therefore, in the final analysis, the three major factors of production (land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology. When we need new skills or techniques in medicine, people will start developing new technology to meet those needs. As equipment proves to be slow or inefficient, new machines will be invented. Technology responds to our needs in helping us improve our standard of living.	['Modern technology is the key to the improvement of standard of living.']
The writer picked out a _ in the library.	"I had never really liked reading and thought it was a waste of time. But once my teacher told our class to go to the library and find our favorite books. I love basketball, so I picked out a basketball book. It was called ""Hoops"" by Water Dean Myers. It is a good novel, and suitable for basketball lovers. This story is about a high school ball player named Lonnie. Lonnie lives in a poor family in Harlem, New York. He is a good basketball player and dreams of playing basketball in college, and of course in the NBA. When Cal, his new coach, walks into his life, he just wants to keep away from him. But at last they become friends and face many challenges together. I am now reading more of Walter Dean Myers' books. A lot of his books are about growing up in Harlem, just like he did. However, I like ""Hoops"" best. From Lonnie, you will learn that the people around you really affect who you are, and how much it helps to have the support of family and friends in your life. This book also makes me think about how hard it would be to grow up in a rough neighborhood. I have realized that we must believe in ourselves when life gets hard. I have learned a lot from this book, and I think anyone will learn much after reading it. It is a good story, and I really suggest that everyone read it. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I do."	['novel']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"When Gretchen Baxter gets home from work as a New York City book editor, she checks her Blackberry at the door. ""I think we are attached to these devices in a way that is not always positive,"" says Baxter, who'd rather focus at home on her husband and 12-year-old daughter. ""It's there and it beckons . That's human nature (but)...we kind of get crazy sometimes and we don't know where it should stop."" Americans are connected at unprecedented levels--93% now use cell phones or wireless devices; one third of those are ""smart phones"" that allow users to browse the web and check e-mails, among other things. The benefits are obvious: checking messages on the road, staying in touch with friends and family, efficiently using time once spent waiting around. The _ : often, we're effectively disconnecting from those in the same room. That's why, despite all the technology that makes communicating easier than ever, 2010 was the year we stopped talking to one another. From texting at dinner to posting on Facebook from work or checking e-mails while on a date, the connectivity revolution is creating a lot of divided attention, not to mention social anxiety. Many analysts say it's time to step back and reassess . ""What we're going to see in the future is new opportunities for people to be plugged in and connected like never before,"" says Scott Campbell. ""It can be a good thing, but I also see new ways the traditional social construction is getting somewhat torn apart."" Our days are filled with beeps and pings--many of which pull us away from tasks at hand or face-to-face conversations. We may feel that the distractions are too much, but we can't seem to stop posting, texting or surfing. ""We're going through a period of adjustment and rebalancing, "" says Sherry Turkle and she wants to remind people that technology can be turned off. ""Our human purposes are to really have connections with people,"" she says. ""We have to reclaim it. It's not going to take place by itself."""

"On the sign what the man wrote was, "" _ ""."	"One morning, a blind boy sat beside a building with a hat by his feet.He held a sign which said, ""I am blind.Please help me."" There were only a few coins in the hat.A man was walking by.He took out a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat.He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words on it.He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by could the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up.A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy.That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were.The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, ""Are you the one who changed my sign in the morning? What did you write?"" The man said, ""I only wrote the truth.I said what you said, but in a different way."" What he had written was, ""Today is a beautiful day, but I can' t see it."" Do you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing? Of course both signs told people the boy was blind.But the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat.The second sign told people that they were able to enjoy the beautiful day, but the boy could not enjoy it because he was blind. The first sign simply said the boy was blind, while the second sig told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. There are at least two lessons we can learn from this simple story. The first is:Treasure what you have.Someone else has less.Try your best to help those who need your help. The second is:Be creative.Think differently.There is always a better way."

What did the elderly lady do?	"In 2012, I had just recovered from a serious illness when I received an invitation to a writer's conference in Orlando, Florida. My family and friends persuaded me that a holiday might be just what the doctor ordered, so off I went. Arriving in the Sunshine State was not easy, but I managed to catch a taxi to the hotel. The next morning, I caught another taxi to do some shopping. Later I went to a cafe to buy some lunch, but having my sandwich and drink in my hands, I saw that all the tables were occupied . Then I heard a friendly voice saying, ""You can share my table."" I thankfully sat down with the smiling elderly lady and we shared a happy lunch together. As the meal drew to a close she asked how long I would be in Orlando. I had already told her that I hadn't hired a car, and hadn't realized how costly taking taxis would be. After a while she said, ""My dear, don't use any more taxis. It would be my pleasure to drive you wherever you wish."" I told her that I couldn't put her to that trouble, but she insisted. She took details of where I was staying and the next morning she drove me to Disney World. She took me through the park's gates and spent some time with me before leaving me to explore alone. At the end of the day, she returned to take me back to my hotel. The next few days, she drove me around Orlando's tourist areas. I offered her money but she refused to take any. When we had lunch on my last day, I thanked her for her kindness. I'll never forget that wonderful lady who filled my holiday in Florida with wonderful memories."	['She drove the author to a park.']

Scientists think a fidget habit to be _ .	Have you eaten too much over the holidays? You should try fidgeting for a while. Those around you might not like it, but scratching (moving your nails against a part of your body) and twitching (moving suddenly and quickly when you don't want to) is an important way of burning up calories . American researchers have found that some people's squirming (continuously turn your body when nervous) and wigging (move in small movements, especially from side to side) equals several miles of slow running each day. The scientists, based at the National Institute of Health's laboratory in Phenix, Arizona, are studying why some people get fat and other stay slim. In one study 177 people each spent 24 hours in a room in the institute where the amount of energy is measured by their oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. By the end of the day, some people had burned up 800 calories in toe-tapping, (moving the front part of your foot up and down) finger-drumming (hitting your fingers continuously and lightly against something hard) and other nervous habits. However, others had burned up only 100 calories. The researchers found that slim women fidget more than fat women, but there was no significant difference in men. Heavy people burn up more energy when they fidget than thin people do.	['a way to lose fat']
The most effective complaint about what was bought can be made by _ .	"When a consumer finds that something he or she bought is faulty or in some other way does not live up to what the producer says for it, the first step is to present the warranty ,or any other records that might help, at the store of buying. In most cases, this action will produce results. However, if it does not, there are various means the consumer may use to gain satisfaction.A simple and common method used by many consumers is to complain directly to the store manager. In general, the ""higher up"" the consumer takes his or her complaint, the faster he or she can expect it to be settled. In such a case, it is usually settled in the consumer's favour, taking it as true that he or she has a just right. Consumers should complain in person whenever possible, but if they cannot get to the place of buying, it is acceptable to phone or write the complaint in a letter. Complaining is usually most effective when it is done politely but firmly, and especially when the consumer can show clearly what is wrong with what was bought in question. If this cannot be done, the consumer will succeed best by presenting specific information as to what is wrong, rather than by making general statements. For example,""The left speaker does not work at all and the sound coming out of the right one is unclear"" is better than ""This stereo does not work."". The store manager may advise the consumer to write to the producer, if so, the consumer should do this, stating the complaint as politely and as firmly as possible. But if a polite complaint does not achieve the expected result, the consumer can go a step further. He or she can threaten to take the seller to court or report the seller to a public organization responsible for protecting consumers' rights."	['explaining exactly what is wrong with it']
Other people think the Italian violin makers _ .	Old Cremona Violins Most musicians agree that the best violins were first made in Cremona, Italy, about 200 years ago. These violins sound better than any others. They even sound better than violins made today. Violin makers and scientists try to make instruments like the Italian violins. But they aren't the same. Musicians still prefer the old ones. Some people think it is the age of the violins. But not all old violins sound wonderful. Only the old violins from Cremona are special . So age cannot be the answer. Other people think the secret to those violins is the wood. The wood must be from certain kinds of trees. But the kind of wood may not be so important. It may be more important to cut the wood in a special way. Wood for a violin must be cut very carefully. It has to be the right size and shape . The smallest difference will change the sound of the violin. Musicians sometimes think that this was the secret of the Italians. Maybe they understood more than we do about how to cut the wood. Size and shape may not be the answer, either. Scientists can make new ones that are exactly the same size and shape. But the new violins still do not sound as good as the old ones. Some scientists think the secret may be the varnish. Varnish is what covers the wood of the violin. It makes the wood look shiny. It also helps the sound of the instrument. But no one knows what the Italian violin makers used in their varnish.	['knew something special']
_ paid for the cost of the building of the Sydney Opera House.	"The Sydney Opera House is a very famous building in the world. It has become Sydney's best-known landmark and international symbol. The Opera House with a "" sailing roof"" was designed by a famous Danish architect ,Utzon. The base for the building was started in 1959, years before the designs were finished. Utzon spent four years designing the Opera House. In 1962, the designs were finalized and the construction began. In 1967, they started the decoration inside. It took 14 years in total to build the Opera House. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened it on October 20th, 1973. The Sydney Opera House cost around $100 million and was paid for by the public 6,225 square meters of glass was used to build it. The Opera House includes 1,000 rooms. It is 185 meters long and 120 meters wide. The building's roof sections weigh about 15 tons. Each year, this fantastic building attracts 200,000 tourists to come for a visit or enjoy events in it.

The passage is most probably from _ .	"Scientists have claimed a milestone in the drive for new energy--development of the first practical artificial leaf, an advanced solar cell that imitates the process,called photosynthesis ,that green plants use to make sunlight and water into energy. ""A practical artificial leaf has been a dream of scientists for decades,""said Daniel Nocera,who led the research team.""We believe we have made it.The artificial leaf shows particular promise as an inexpensive source of electricity for homes of the poor in developing countries. One can imagine villages in India and Africa soon purchasing an affordable basic power system based on this technology."" The leaf is like the shape of a poker card but thinner.Placed in water in a bright sunlight,it could produce enough electricity to supply a house in a developing country with electricity for a day by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, which are stored in a fuel cell to produce electricity. The""artificial leaf""is not a new concept.The first artificial leaf was developed more than a decade ago by John Ttlrner.However, it was impractical for wider use,as it was composed of rare,expensive metals and was highly unstable with a lifespan of barely one day. Nocera's new leaf overcomes these problems.It is made of inexpensive materials that are widely available,works under simple conditions and is highly stable.Laboratory studies showed that it could operate continuously for at least 45 hours without a drop in activity. The key to this breakthrough is Nocera's recent discovery of several new powerful, inexpensive catalysts,which are able to accelerate the chemical reaction under simple conditions.Right now, Nocera's leaf is about 10 times more efficient at carrying out photosynthesis than a natural leaf.Yet he is optimistic that he can boost the efficiency of the device much higher in the future."

According to the passage, Charles Darwin's whole life was changed by _ .	"As a boy, Charles Robert Darwin collected anything that caught his interest: insects, coins and interesting stones. He was not very clever, but Darwin was good at doing the things that interested him. His father was a doctor, so Darwin was sent to Edinburgh to study medicine, and was planned to follow a medical career. But Charles found the lectures boring. Then his father sent him to Cambridge University to study to be a priest. While at Cambridge, Darwin's interest in zoology and geography grew. Later he got a letter from Robert FitzRoy who was planning to make a voyage around the world on a ship, the Beagle. He wanted a naturalist to join the ship, and Darwin was recommended . That voyage was the start of Darwin's great life. As the Beagle sailed around the world, Darwin began to wonder how life had developed on earth. He began to observe everything. After he was home, he set to work, getting his collection in order. His first great work The Zoology of the Beagle was well received, but he was slow to make public his ideas on the origin of life. Later Darwin and Wallace, another naturalist who had the same opinions as Darwin, produced a paper together. Darwin's great book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (<<>> ) appeared. It attracted a storm. People thought that Darwin was saying they were descended from monkeys. What a shameful idea! Although most scientists agreed that Darwin was right, the Church was still so strong that Darwin never received any honors for his work. Afterwards, he published another great work, The Descent of Man. His health grew worse, but he still worked. ""When I have to give up observation, I shall die,"" he said. He was still working on 17, April, 1882. He was dead two days later."	['the voyage of the Beagle']
We can know from the passage that about _ US teen workers are injured every year.	"Chelsea Bourque was 17 years old. When she took a summer job, her mother, Kim Guidry, was confident her daughter would get good life experience. And Chelsea wanted to make her own money and be more independent. Kim didn't worry about her daughter because she'd known the store owner for years. Chelsea did such a good job that when summer ended she was asked to stay on and even open and close the shop sometimes. That was when Kim started feeling uneasy. ""She'd be there alone with a drawer full of money for the first or last 20 minutes of her shift ,"" says Kim. ""If she was opening, I'd drop her off to lock the door the minute she got into the building, and I'd wait in the car until the owner arrived. If she was closing, I'd arrive 20 minutes early. You can never be too careful."" Kim's concerns were natural. Even though the 6 million American teens who hold job benefit a lot -- learning to manage money, developing time-management skills, and becoming good at problem-solving with other people -- they face some dangers as well. About 230 000 teen workers are injured yearly, from burns and cuts in restaurant kitchens to falls from roofs on buildings. Deaths, fortunately, are rare, but they do happen -- between 60 and 70 each year, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. But for most teens and their parents, the pay-offs of working do more good than harm. So help your teens get most out of employment with these stay-safe tips."	['4%']

The experiment showed that the smaller fish _ .	"People diet to look more attractive.Fish diet to avoid being beaten up,thrown out of their social group,and getting eaten as a result.That is the fascinating conclusion of the latest research into fish behavior by a team of Australian scientists. The research team have discovered that subordinate fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.""In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,"" explains Marian Wong.""All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation."" The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up. It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast. The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small. While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable. The research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is a habit far from exclusive to humans.""As yet,we lack a complete understanding of how widespread the voluntary reduction of food intake is in nature,"" the researchers comment.""Data on human dieting suggests that,while humans generally diet to improve health or increase attractiveness,rarely does it improve long-term health and males regularly prefer females that are fatter than the females' own ideal."""

Which is the most correct description of the author's too? He was/had _ .	"Last night was the last game for my eight-year-old son's soccer team. It was the final quarter. The score was two to one, my son's team in the lead. Parents surrounded the playground, offering encouragement. With less than ten seconds remaining, the ball suddenly rolled in front of my son's teammate, Mickey O' Donnel. With shouts of ""Kick it!"" echoing across the playground, Mickey turned around and gave it everything he had. All around me the crowd erupted . O'Donnel had scored! Then there was silence. Mickey had scored all right, but in the wrong goal, ending the game in a tie. For a moment there was a total _ . You see, Mickey has Down syndrome and for him there is no such thing as a wrong goal. All goals were celebrated by a joyous hug from Mickey. He had even been known to hug the opposing players when they scored. The silence was finally broken when Mickey, his face filled with joy, hugged my son tightly and shouted, ""I scored! I scored. Everybody won! Everybody won!"" For a moment I held my breath, not sure how my son would react. I need not have worried. I watched, through tears, as my son threw up his hand in the classic high-five salute and started chanting, ""Way to go Mickey! Way to go Mickey!"" Within moments both teams surrounded Mickey, joining in the chant and congratulating him on his goal. Mike happily and everyone sent their wishes to him. Later that night, when my daughter asked who had won, I smiled as I replied, ""It was a tie. Everybody won."""	['sympathy']
The moon is _ to the earth than the sun.	The moon looks bigger than stars at night. But in fact, it is smaller than any stars. The moon looks big to us, because it is closer to us than the stars. The moon goes round the earth. It makes one trip about four weeks. The moon is round and looks beautiful. Now people know quite a lot about the moon. There is no air or water on the moon, so there are not any trees or animals or people on it. The moon gets its light from the sun, but some places on the moon are quite dark. It's very cold at night.

Why did the grandfather send the author a squash?	My grandfather spent most of his life in a turbulent India. After settling in New York, he took up his true passion: gardening. Grandfather's garden was where I took refuge from a world of adults and schoolwork. My grandfather cultivated squash and tomatoes -- it was not rare to find me somewhere in the garden, either secretly eating a tomato, or just sitting and admiring my grandfather's hard work. However, as time went by, I did not have the chance to visit his house as often as I used to. On my eleventh birthday, I received a gift bag wrapped in pretty paper from my grandfather. Excited to see what he had given to me for my birthday, I tore apart the paper only to find a yellow squash. I was very angry. What a stupid present! But gradually, I realized that in my developing a relationship with his garden, I had unknowingly grown very close to my grandfather himself, something he wished to remind me of through his gift. His commitment towards doing things definitely influenced me. It could bring him a sense of accomplishment. Because of him, I try to model the idea of approaching everything with both drive and passion. My grandfather passed away five years ago, but his influence on me could not be bigger than it is today. As I prepare to enter college and move on from my relatively sheltered high school life toward achieving complete independence, allowing my passions to find their way into whatever I may be doing will be very necessary. I still look up to my grandfather very much to this day, and I hope that one day I will be able to sow in my own garden, and give someone else a squash on his or her birthday -- it was the most meaningful gift I have ever received.[:ZXXK]	['He wanted to remind the author that they had been close.']

The young man felt surprised when Diaz _ .	"When Julio Diaz stepped off the subway after work one night, he was simply planning to go to his favorite local diner for a meal. But when a teenage boy approached him with a knife, Diaz knew the evening was about to take a more dramatic turn. The young man demanded Diaz's wallet, and Diaz passed it over without objection . But just as he turned to walk away, Diaz called, ""Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something."" The young man turned around, surprised. ""If you're going to rob people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep warm."" The teenager looked at Diaz in disbelief, and asked why he would do such a thing. Diaz replied, ""If you're willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, I guess you must really need the money.""He said he was heading out for dinner, and that he would be happy to take someone with him. The young man decided to _ his offer. As they were sitting at the table, the manager, dishwashers and waiters all stopped over to say hello to Diaz, and the young man was amazed at his popularity. ""Haven't you been taught that you should be nice to everybody?""Diaz asked him. ""Yeah, but I didn't think people actually behaved that way,"" the teenager replied. Thanks to Diaz, he was beginning to see that kindness wasn't so strange, after all. When the bill came, Diaz told the teen that he'd have to get the check. After all, he still had Diaz's wallet. But the teenager put the wallet on the table without a moment's thought, and Diaz treated him to dinner. Diaz also gave the would-be robber a $20 bill -- in exchange for his knife. ""I figure, you know, if you treat people right, you can only hope that they treat you right,"" Diaz said."	['called him to wait for a moment']
What's the main idea of this passage?	"China is a nation with a rich culture in handwriting. ""Even though the computer is widely used today, Chinese people should not forget the skill of writing with hands,"" said a Chinese government official . Nowadays, the computer has become a very useful tool to help people to write. As people use computers more often than before, many people have forgotten how to write Chinese characters . People often make a lot of mistakes in writing. At present, China is trying to help pupils and teachers to improve their writing with the help of information technology. With the technology, it is hoped that teachers can write their teaching contents on the blackboard and students can _ by writing, too. The Chinese character test shows that nowadays, many college students' handwriting has become worse. Many college students do not know how to compose words or sentences in Chinese character in the right way. Not only kids, many adults also have met the same problem. They might be able to tell the general form of a certain character. However, if you ask them to spell out the character in detail , they can't. On the other hand, they can easily type out the character on a computer. In the national language teaching course, we can solve this problem with the use of certain technologies. Actually, apart from technology, there is a lot that we can do. For example, we may ask students to finish their homework by writing with hands instead of typing."

According to the passage, what can users do if they lose their smart phones?	"Which are you more likely to have with you at any given moment-your cell phone or your wallet? Soon you may be able to throw your wallet away and pay for things with a quick wave of your smart phone over an electronic scanner. In January, Starbucks announced that customers could start using their phones to buy coffee in 6,800 of its stores. This is the first pay-by-phone practice in the U.S., but we're likely to see more wireless payment alternatives as something called near field communication (NFC) gets into America's consumer electronics. Last December, some new smart phones which contain an NFC chip were introduced to the public. Already in use in parts of Asia and Europe, NFC allows shoppers to wave their phones a few inches above a payment terminal - a contact- free system built for speed and convenience. But before NFC becomes widely adopted in the U.S., a few problems need to be worked out, like who will get to collect the profitable transaction fees. Although some credit card providers have been experimenting with wave-and- pay systems that use NFC-enabled credit cards, cell phone service providers may try to muscle their way into the point-of-sale(POS)market. Three big cell phone service providers have formed a joint venture that will go into operation over the next 15 months. Its goal is ""to lead the U.S. payments industry from cards to mobile phone."" The other big NFC issue, apart from how payments will be processed, is security. For instance, what's to stop a thief from digitally pick-pocketing you? ""We're still not at the point where an attacker can just brush against you in a crowd and steal all the money out of your phone,"" says Jimmy Shah. A mobile- security researcher, ""Users may also be able to set transaction limits, perhaps requiring a password to be entered for larger purchases."" Still uneasy about this digital-wallet business? Keep in mind that if you lose your smart phone, it can be located on a map and remotely disabled. Plus, your phone can be password protected. Your wallet isn't."

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"-For five days, Edmonton's Downtown Park is transformed into one huge stage where artists are able to share their talents, and where people are able to celebrate and enjoy themselves. Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. ""People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,"" Riedel said. ""It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together."" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so are people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests. With so many years of experience, the festival has become a well-oiled machine, and does whatever it can to make attendees feel as comfortable as possible. There are free water stations throughout the venue for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a $2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended. A bike lock-up area is provided and will be available Thursday until Sunday one hour before the gates open until 45 minutes after the gates close. The Edmonton Folk Music Festival begins on Wednesday, Aug. 4 with Van Morrison playing the special donation fund concert, and will finish up on Sunday, Aug. 8."

Unfortunately, juggling these parts of your life will start to show through fine lines and dull, tired skin. ""This is the time to learn relaxation techniques like thinking and deep breathing to help reduce stress"", says Helga Hefner, global educator of Aveda. Sleep is your best weapon during these years. A full eight hours of sleep is necessary for skin to look and perform its best and uninterrupted is the best type.. ""Always make sure the head is raised above the body,"" says Dr Daniel Maes, senior vice-president of Estee Lauder Global Research and Development. This helps to avoid an accumulation of blood to the face and you will wake less puffy. If you sleep in an awkward position, you will wake with puffy eyes and lines on your face because of the constriction blood flow to the skin. Try and train yourself to sleep on your back, too, or you may notice lines forming on one side of your face. A lack of sleep is also linked to weight gain-the longer you are awake the more fuel your body will think it needs, so you may find yourself with an increased appetite. If you are struggling with sleep, try adding aromatherapy oils such as lavender or ylang ylang to your pillows or a bath before bed."

How long did the first flight of the solar powered plane last?	"Recently,a solar powered plane took to the sky for the first time. It had passed an important test on the way to travel around the world. The plane took off from an airport in Switzerland at 45km an hour. It slowly rose above the fields and into the sky.

The drivers were _ to pay the farmer for pulling their cars out of the hole.	"There was once a farmer who lived near a road. It was not a busy road,but from time to time,cars passed the farm.

Kane needed attention because he wanted to show _ .	"Recently I came in contact with the true meaning of love. That would have been, Kane, a boy. Kane was the two-year-old son of Jolene, my new neighbor. At a glance Kane was a sight. He'd been born with hard sticks for legs. And on that morning I witnessed the effect that Kane's physical shortcomings had on his family. But I also witnessed much more than that. I saw an extraordinary family that embraced this special child. A family that wouldn't allow Kane to know he was different. Jolene had constructed a small cart just a few inches off the floor for his son to get around. Using his hands to move about, Kane moved the cart to ""go to"" any place just as everyone else was able to do. Kane worked that little cart like a master. Kane was a vital focus of the entire family. He was more than just a member of the family; he was the soul. This child was the driver, the motivator, and the founder of much of the interaction. Much later in my life, I came to realize that God had sent this child to help some of us who just weren't getting what love was all about. Even with my limited capacity for understanding at the time that Kane was a highly developed spirit with great wisdom. Kane demanded attention, but not because of his mobility challenges or other apparent shortcomings. In his mind, he had no challenges or shortcomings. The truth is that he received attention because he was alive and real and had so much to offer. Kane was and still is a lot of warm and powerful energy sent to us all, so we might learn that love surpasses all things. Kane, a fragile yet lovely baby, was here to teach us all an important lesson. And at the age of two he did just that."	['he had the power to prove he was capable too']

The author intends to tell us that _ .	"""Mom, I have cancer."" These four words catapulted my son and me on a journey that lasted two years. On that day I felt a wave of paralyzing fear. Scott was the oldest of my four children. He was 33 years old and a successful assistant principal at SamRayburn Hifht School in Pasadena, Texas. He and his wife Carolyn were busy raising four active children. Scott was 6'2'', weighed 200 pounds and had never been sick a day in his life. A few month earlier a mole on his neck had changed color. ""Dr.Warner called,"" Scott said that spring morning. ""It's melanoma. "" I tried to comfort him, naming all the people I knew who had survived skin cancer. Yet, I felt small tentacles of fear begin to wrap around my chest. Our next stop was MDAnderson, the famous cancer hospital in Houston. Scott had surgery at the end of May and was scheduled for radiation treatments over the summer recess. ""There is an 80 percent chance it won't reoccur,"" the doctors said. At the end of summer, all his tests came back negative and Scott was back at school in the fall. However, in December, Scott discovered a lump on his neck. It was examined and the result came back ""malignant. "" We now realized that Scott fell into the 20 percent category. I could feel the tentacles tightening around my chest. He entered the hospital for an aggressive treatment, a combination of interferon and interleukin. After five months of treatment, he had radical surgery on his neck. The test results were encouraging, only three of the 33 lymph nodes removed were malignant. We were very hopeful. For the next six months, Scott's follow-up visits went well. Then in October, X-ray revealed a spot on his lung. The spot was removed during surgery and the doctors tried to be optimistic. It was a daily battle to control the fear and panic each setback brought. In January, he was diagnosed as having had a ""disease explosion."" The cancer had spread to his lungs, spine and liver and he was given three to six months to live. There were times during this period when I felt like I was having a heart attack. _ When you watch your child battle cancer, you experience a roller coaster of emotions. There are moments of hope and optimism but a bad test result or even an unusual pain can bring on dread and panic. Scott was readmitted to the hospital for one last try with chemotherapy. He died, quite suddenly, just six weeks after his last diagnosis. I was completely destroyed. I had counted on those last few months. The next morning I was busy notifying people and making funeral arrangements. I remember having this nagging feeling that something was physically wrong with me. It took a moment to realize that the crushing sensation in my chest was gone. The thing every parent fears the most had happened. My son was gone. Of course, the fear had been replaced by unbearable sorrow. After you lose a child, it is so difficult to go on. The most minimal tasks, combing your hair or taking a shower, becoming monumental. For months I just sat and stared into space. That spring, the trees began to bloom; flowers began to pop up in my garden. Friendswood was coming back to life but I was dead inside. During those last weeks, Scott and I often spoke about life and death. Fragments of those conversations kept playing over and over in my mind. ""Don't let this ruin your life, Mom."" ""Make sure Dad re models his workshop."" ""Please, take care of my family."" I remember wishing I could have just one more conversation with him. I knew what I would say, but what would Scott say? ""I know how much you love me, Mom. So just sit on the couch and cry."" No, I knew him better than that. Scott loved life and knew how precious it is. I could almost hear his voice saying, ""Get up Mom, Get on with your life. It's too valuable to waste."" That was the day I began to move forward. I signed up for a cake decorating class. Soon I was making cakes for holidays and birthdays. My daughter-in-law told me about a writing class in Houston. I hadn't written in years, but since I was retired I decided it be time to start again. The local college advertised a Life Story Writing class that I joined. There I met women who had also lost their children. The Poet Laureate of Texas was scheduled to speak at our local Barnes and Noble. I attended and joined our local poetry society. I never dreamed that writing essays and poems about Scott could be so therapeutic. Several of those poems have ever been published. In addition, each group brought more and more people into my life.. I don't believe you ever recover from the loss of a child. Scott is in my heart and mind every day. However, I do believe you can survive. Scott fought so bravery to live and he never gave up. He taught me that life is a gift that should be cherished, not wasted. It has taken years to become the person I am today. The journey has been a difficult, painful process but certainly worth the effort and I know that my son would be proud."	"[""We'd better make our life count instead of counting your days.""]"

Which is NOT true?	"The earth is 4 600 million years old. We humans have lived on earth for only 35 000 years, but during this period we have changed our planet a lot in many ways. Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called ""ozone""(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a ""blanket"" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called ""the greenhouse effect"". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change. All these problems are very serious, so we must do something now. ,A, B, C, D."	['The fewer trees, the better.']
This passage mainly talks about _ .	"The expression ""down to earth"" means being open and honest. It is easy to get on with some one who is down to earth. A down-to-earth person is the opposite of someone who acts important or proud. Down-to-earth people could be important members of society. But they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important. A person who is filled with his own importance and pride is said to"" have his nose in the air"". Americans use another expression that is similar in some ways to down to earth. The expression is"" both feet on the ground"". Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality. He may have dreams, but he does not allow them to have influence on his understanding of what is real. The opposite kind of person is one who ""has his head in the clouds"". Someone with his head in the clouds is a person whose mind is not on what is happening in real life. Such a person may be called a day-dreamer. When we have both our feet on the ground, and when we are down to earth, we do not have our noses in the air. We act honestly and openly to others. Our lives are like the ground below us---solid and strong."	['the use of some expressions']

In the writer's opinion, _ .	It is quite reasonable to blame traffic jams, the cost of gas and the great speed of modern life, but manners on the road are becoming horrible.Everybody knows that the nicest men would become fierce tigers behind the wheel.It is all right to have a tiger in a cage, but to have one in the driver's seat is another matter altogether. Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too.It takes the most cool-headed drivers great patience to give up the desire to beat back when forced to face rude driving.On the other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards reducing the possibility of quarrelling and fighting.A friendly nod or a wave of thanks in answer to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of good will and calm so necessary in modern traffic condition.But such behaviors of politeness are by no means enough.Many drivers nowadays don't even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it. However, misplaced politeness can also be dangerous.Typical examples are the driver who waves a child crossing the street at a wrong place into the path of oncoming cars that may be not able to stop in time.The same goes for encouraging old ladies to cross the road wherever and whenever they want to.It always amazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead bodies of these grannies . An experienced driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help if drivers learnt to correctly join in traffic stream without causing total blockages that give rise to unpleasant feelings.Unfortunately, modern drivers can't even learn to drive.Years ago, experts warned us that the fast increase of the car ownership would demand more _ from all road users.It is high time for all of us to take this message to heart.

It is _ that reading is out of date.	Reading is a good hobby for all kinds of reasons. First , reading is fun. You can always keep yourself happy if like reading. You will never feel bored or tired. Next, you can read a book anywhere----in a car, on a plane, or even in the bathroom. All you need is a book! Another good reason for reading is that it is useful. If you read as a hobby, you will get better and better at it. And you will read faster and find it easier to understand what you read. As your reading skills improve, you will probably find your schoolwork becomes much better. Some people say that reading is out of date . This is not true.

The author of the passage would agree that _ .	Emotional eating is when people use food as a way to deal with feelings instead of to satisfy hunger. We've all been there, finishing a whole bag of chips out of boredom or eating cookie after cookie while _ for a big test. But when done a lot -- especially without realizing it -- emotional eating can affect weight, health, and overall well-being. Not many of us make the connection between eating and our feelings. But understanding what drives emotional eating can help people take steps to change it. One of the biggest myths about emotional eating is that it's prompted by negative feelings. Yes, people often turn to food when they're stressed out, lonely, sad, anxious, or bored. But emotional eating can be linked to positive feelings too, like the romance of sharing dessert on Valentine's Day or the celebration of a holiday feast. Sometimes emotional eating is tied to major life events, like a death or a divorce. More often, though, it's the countless little daily stresses that cause someone to seek comfort or distraction in food. Emotional eating patterns can be learned: A child who is given candy after a big achievement may grow up using candy as a reward for a job well done. A kid who is given cookies as a way to stop crying may learn to link cookies with comfort. We're all emotional eaters to some extent. But for some people, emotional eating can be a real problem, causing serious weight gain or cycles of binging and purging. The trouble with emotional eating (apart from the health issues) is that once the pleasure of eating is gone, the feelings that cause it remain. And you often may feel worse about eating the amount or type of food you did. That's why it helps to know the differences between physical hunger and emotional hunger. Next time you reach for a snack, check in and see which type of hunger is driving it.	['we should be careful with emotional eating']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	"Mary Buendia once spent a day in an airplane, looking for a cat. She didn't find it that day. The plane flew around all over the world for three weeks with the cat on board. She finally found it in the cargo hold and sent it home first-class. Another time ,she found two suitcases full of birds from Turkey. But her strangest experience was when she pulled a snake out of a man's pants. Mary Buendia is an animal health inspector at JFK Airport in New York. She takes care of all the animals that pass through the airport and checks that they are healthy. In the Animal Health Center, there are areas for dogs, cats, reptiles, birds, and fish. There is also an area for very big animals. The biggest they ever had was a black rhino. ""It was no problem."" she says. At the center, they receive all types of animals monkeys, wild cats, poisonous spiders. It's impossible for one person to know about all of these, but there are 20 people working with Mary. Among them, they understand how to take care of the animals. She recently had to feed a group of toucans, which are rare birds. ""luckily,"" she says, ""there is a supermarket nearby which is open 24 hours. I had to go at 2 a.m to buy bananas. Mary often works at night. ""It's quiet between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m."" she says, ""because we don't have night flights. We try to give the animals a quiet night."" Mary clearly loves her job. ""You never know what the day will bring,""she says, and goes off to feed the birds."	['only healthy animals can be permitted to go aboard the airplane']
How did little Aidan Sullivan feel when he knew the money was missing.	"A heartless thief is believed to have crashed a fund-raiser and made off with a bag of cash meant to help a New York City firefighter pay for life-changing surgery for his 9-year-old son. But little Aidan Sullivan -- who was born with a facial defect and no right ear -- yesterday put up a brave front, with a message for the crook(thief): ""I'm going to kick your butt!"" ""I want to look normal,"" said Aidan, whose father, Tim, is a firefighter in the Bronx. The third-grader has hemi facial micro soma, in which one half of the face doesn't develop correctly. Last weekend, family friend Peter Drake, a Ridgefield, Conn., firefighter, hosted a fund-raiser, collecting between $8,000 and $9,000. But when the party at a Danbury, Conn., Irish cultural center was over, the money had disappeared. ""At the end of the night, all the money that was donated was put in a zippered bag,"" said Tim Sullivan. ""A bartender gave the bag to Pete... He had it in his hands. He put it down to go do something, and when he came back, he saw that it was missing."" Sullivan said his longtime friend -- who has had fund-raisers to pay for Aidan's 10 previous surgeries -- is ""devastated."" ""Pete was so upset. He kept saying, 'I let Aidan down, I let Aidan down,"" Colleen Sullivan, 40, recalled. ""We even went Dumpster diving, in case it was thrown out."" The Sullivans plan to go ahead with the March 1 surgery led by specialists at NYU's Langone Medical Center in Manhattan. The money would have offset the $10,000 to $15,000 that insurance doesn't cover. Yesterday, Aidan said he's not a fan of hospitals and doesn't like to be away from his sister, Kaylee, 4. But he's willing to do it. ""I'm excited,"" he said. ""Finally, an ear."""	['He felt annoyed.']
What is the Mural Arts Program in Philadelphia aimed at?	"Since 1984, Philadelphia has been cleaning up its act. One by one, graffiti-covered walls are being changed into outdoor art. So far, more than 1,800 murals have been painted. Philadelphia now has more murals than any other American city. The walls that were once ugly with graffiti are now covered with beautiful pictures of historical heroes and modern art, thanks to the Mural Arts Program (MAP). Its work makes schools and public places attractive, and its citizens very proud. The program began as part of Philadelphia's Anti-Graffiti Network. Jane Golden is the MAP's artistic director. ""When people ask me what our program is about,"" she says, ""I answer them with one word: hope."" Each year, the MAP offers youth art programs and workshops. Some one-time graffiti writers even help paint MAP murals. The MAP's work, says Golden, is all about developing a sense of community . When a neighborhood requests a mural, the MAP works with the people there to develop a message. Some messages have been ""Safe Streets,"" ""Love and Care,"" and ""Peace Walk."" The MAP receives up to 50 requests for murals each week. Last year, the workers painted 140 murals. ""The making of a mural enters people's collective memory as an extraordinary, pleasant moment in neighborhood history"" says Golden, who began as a muralist in Los Angeles."

which statement is true according to the passage	"The quality of water supply in southern Beijing has been improving in recent years, an official said. In addition to improvements in the network of pipes, the government has been upgrading three recycled water plants in the south of the capital, said Zhao Lei, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Commission of Development and Reform. ""The transformation of the three plants has increased the recycled water processing capacity by 160,000 cubic meters per day,"" he said. In addition, the city is also speeding up the construction of sewage treatment plants to further recycle the sewage, Zhao said. Zhang Xiang, a researcher from Nature University, an environmental protection NGO in Beijing, said recycled water use should be promoted, especially in water-scarce cities such as Beijing. Setting up more recycled water plants in the capital will not only promote efficient water use, but also reduce costs because recycling water is much cheaper than transferring it over long distances, he said. According to the Beijing Water Authority, the capital will set up 46 more recycled water plants citywide in the next three years while upgrading 20 sewage treatment plants. The treatment rate of domestic sewage in downtown Beijing will reach 98 percent by the end of 2015, it said. The capital's recycled water is mainly used for industry, landscaping and cleaning, Zhang said. Many new communities in southern Beijing are equipped with a network to recycle water. In the past, people were not enthusiastic about using recycled water. However, as the government has boosted the quality of recycled water and set up more recycled water plants, more residents are gradually accepting it. Residents in southern Beijing will also enjoy more clean energy, as the government will replace traditional coal-burning stoves with electric radiators as part of a three-year plan to develop southern Beijing from 2013 to 2015. Since 2010, Beijing has taken measures to develop its southern areas. Earlier efforts have seen the region, which used to rely heavily on low-end industries such as cement factories and small coal mines, being turned into a bustling commercial center and home to many educational institutions."

The military camp was built in the village to _ .	"It was a quiet village in which there was a military camp. It was far from the towns and cities and there were some high mountains around. Of course it was a good place for training the new soldiers. But it was difficult for the young men to go outside. Mr. White, an officer of forty, was strict with them and he hardly let them leave the camp. Once Mr. White was ill in bed. He couldn't work, so a young officer, Mr. Hunt, began to train the new soldiers instead of him. He knew the young men well and let nine soldiers go to the nearest town to have a holiday. But night fell and none came back to the camp. He was worried about it and stood at the gate. It was five to twelve when Mr. Hunt decided to go to the town and see what was happening with the young men. He started the car quickly and set off. At that moment the nine soldiers came back. It seemed they were all drunk. Of course they found the officer was angry. ""I'm sorry, sir,"" said the first soldier. ""I left the town on time. But something was wrong with my bus on my way here. I had to buy a horse and made it run fast. Bad luck! It died and I had to run back."" And the other seven soldiers said they were late for the same reasons. It was the last soldier's turn.

What did the Bancroft students do outside the White House?	"A Groundbreaking Event It was an unforgettable field trip. Twenty-six fifth-graders from George Bancroft Elementary School, in Washington, D.C., went to the White House on Friday. They used shovels, rakes and wheelbarrows to help First Lady Michelle Obama break ground on a new vegetable garden. This White House garden is the first since World War II. In the 1940s, First lady Eleanor Roosevelt planted a White House ""Victory Garden"" to encourage Americans to grow gardens at home. Mrs. Obama's new garden is an L-shaped patch near the fountain on the South Lawn. Vegetables to be planted include lettuce, peas, collard greens, onions and spinach. A herb garden will grow garlic, sage and cilantro. These herbs are used in Mexican food, an Obama family favourite. White House chefs will prepare meals for the First Family with food from the garden and some of the produce will be donated to Miriam's Kitchen, a soup kitchen near the White House. Health food is important to Mrs. Obama. She said that the purpose of the garden is to make sure that her family, the White House staff, and guests eat fresh vegetables. Mrs. Obama has also said that she hopes the new White House garden will help educate Americans about the importance of fresh, nutritious food at a time when obesity is a national crisis. A diet high in natural, unprocessed foods helps people maintain a healthy weight. Mrs. Obama said she has found that her daughters, Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, like vegetables more if they have been involved in growing them. ""If they have been involved in planting and picking the vegetables, they are much more curious about giving them a try,"" she said. When Bancroft students go back to the White House this summer they will get to taste the vegetables they helped to grow. After they help to harvest the crops, they will cook them in the White House kitchen and then eat them."	['They helped First Lady Michelle Obama to plant a garden.']

Which of the following ways could possibly save private schools?	Many private institutions of higher education around the country are in danger. Not all will be saved, and perhaps not all deserve to be saved. There are low-quality schools just as there are low-quality businesses. We have no duty to save them simply because they exist. But many promising institutions that deserve to continue are threatened. They are doing a fine job educationally, but they are caught in a financial squeeze, with no way to reduce rising cost or increase income significantly. Raising tuition doesn't bring in more income, for each time tuition goes up, the enrollment goes down, or the amount that must be given away in student aid goes up. Schools are bad businesses, whether public or private, not usually because of mismanagement but because of the nature of the enterprise. They lose money on every customer, and they can go bankrupt either from too few students or too many students. Even a very good college is a very bad business. It is such colleges, promising but threatened, that I worry about. Low enrollment is not their chief problem. Even with full enrollment, they may _ . Efforts to save them, and preferably to keep them private, are a national necessity. There is no basis for arguing that private schools are inherently better than public schools. There are many examples to the contrary. Anyone can name state universities and colleges that rank as the finest in the nation and the world. It is now inevitable that public institutions will be dominant, and therefore diversity is a national necessity. Diversity in the way we support schools tends to give us a healthy diversity in the forms of education. In an imperfect society such as ours, uniformity of education throughout the nation could be dangerous, In an imperfect society, diversity is a positive good. Supporters of public higher education know the importance of sustaining private higher education.	['National awareness and support.']
One reason why pasta is favored is that _ .	Pasta is the world's favorite food. A survey taken in 17 countries confirmed that pasta is what people like to eat most. Not only is pasta the number one food in its home country Italy, but it is also enjoyed in faraway places like the Philippines, Mexico and South Africa. Pasta has become popular, for one thing, because it is cheap and easy to prepare. Just cook noodles or other forms of pasta, make a sauce to go with it and you're finished. Many different types of meals can be created with pasta. It tastes good and fills your stomach. It produces energy in the form of carbohydrates , which is why athletes eat pasta regularly. Pasta can also be kept for a long time. You don't have to use it up at once. Pasta has also become popular because it stands for the Italian way of life. People all over the world like it because it's so simple. It has two basic ingredients, wheat and water, just like bread. Before it became popular in Italy during the 19th century, earlier civilizations also ate pasta. Legend has it that Marco Polo brought pasta back to Italy with him but this is not true. Arabs probably brought a noodle-like dish to Sicily in the 8th century. Farmers have been growing wheat, the main ingredient of pasta, there for ages. The worldwide sales of pasta have risen sharply over the past decade. $16 billion worth of pasta were sold in 2010, compared to $13 billion worth of the favorite food in 2003. Italy leads the pasta-eating community of the world. The Italians are the number one consumers followed by Venezuela and Tunisia. ks5u	['it is easy to prepare and cook']

We can learn from the passage that _ .	In the late nineteenth century, ^5,000 pianos were sold in the United States each year and, with over half a million youths learning to play the instrument, there was a huge demand for sheet music .Indeed the demand was so huge that publishers rushed to enter the profitable market.During the last fifteen years of the century, many publishers began to set up shops in New York, the center for the production of the musical arts By the turn of the nineteenth century many important publishers had their offices on 28thStreet between Broadway and 5th Avenue, and this Is the area that became known as Tin Pan Alley.It was here that publishers adopted new, aggressive business practices and marketing techniques to achieve great sales. How it became to be known by that name is unclear, but the general opinion is that it is down to a visiting journalist by the name of Monroe Rosenfeld.He described the area as being drowned in the noise coming from the producers' offices, sounding as though hundreds of people were hitting tin pans .He used it several times in his newspaper articles in the early twentieth century and the term stuck.With time this name was popularly embraced and many years later it came to describe the U.S.music publishing industry in general. The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885,.but the end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear-cut .Some date it to the start of the Great.Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph and radio replaced sheet music, as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into thel950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll. There's a plaque on the sidewalk on 28th Street in honor of the influence of Tin Pan Alley on American popular culture, but the buildings that were home to the legendary Tin Pan Alley publishers and songwriters are up for sale and may be torn down to make room for modern high-rise buildings.

To make a good impression on others, you should pay special attention to your _ .	Four Efficient Ways to Improve Your Speech 1. Use More Facial Expression One psychologist feels that our facial expression is responsible more than anything else for the impression others have of us. In fact, more than 50 percent of another's impression, he believes, is influenced by the look on your face. Naturally a smile in which the eyes participate is extremely communicative. An unfriendly look often brings the same thing in return. People tend to mirror your expression, so try to show how you feel about a topic or an idea or the audience through your facial expression. 2. Rid Your Inner Fear It's natural to have some tension or nervousness when you appear before an audience. The way to handle it is to put it to work for you, get into action, as Shakespeare observed, action cures fear. There are only a few known ways to control fear. The first is to admit it, do the thing you fear and it will be the death of fear itself. Another simple aid at the last minute before you begin, is to take a few deep breaths, this will help get the butterflies in formation and also keep your voice under control. In fact, if you're thoroughly prepared, just taking a few deep breaths before you're introduced will give you added confidence and balance. Other known ways to control nervousness and fear are to give yourself an encouraging talk or take some physical exercise. 3. Polish Your Voice Our voice is the main instrument we possess for communicating with people, we're all sound sensitive. So invest in a tape recorder, practise your speech by speaking it into the microphone then listen to it. You can even have others join in the evaluation of your strong points and your weaknesses or faults as well. Remember that Demosthenes and Winston Churchill both used pebbles in their mouths while practising their speaking. Simply reading out loud can also help you improve your voice and develop a personal style. 4. Strengthen Your Memory Psychologists tell us that most individuals don't use above ten percent of their natural capacity for memory, that's comparable to trying to run a car on one cylinder . Why do most people use so little of their power of memory? Because they don't practise the fundamentals of remembering. First and most important, it's necessary to have a burning desire to remember, it's difficult to recall anything without wanting to do so. Step number two is concentration. Henry Ward Beecher once observed, one hour of intense concentration can accomplish more than years of dreaming. The next principle is repetition, we learned many things in school by rote by repetition, when you hear a name for the first time repeat it, spell it, write it down, review it, you'll soon know it by heart.

The best title for the passage might be.	Every four years athletes from the world take part in the Olympic Games. Both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games are held every four years. The Winter Olympic Games are usually held two years before the Summer Olympic Games. The ancient Olympic Games began around the year 776 BC in Greece. Many of the sports were the same as they are now. Some of the games in which the young men competed were: running, jumping, and wrestling. Women were not allowed to take part in the games. After about the year 393 AD the Olympic Games stopped. For centuries there were no Olympic Games. But they were not forgotten. The first Olympic Games in modern times happened in 1896. They were held in Greece--the country in which the Games were born. in the Games there were 311 competitors from 13 countries. After that more and more countries joined in the Games. In 2000, over 10,000 athletes from 227 countries went to Sydney; Australia, for the 27th Olympic Games! There are 300 different events in the Games. Horse riding, hammer throw and shooting are some of the more unusual events.	['The Olympic Games']

The writer's chief argument against high heels is that _ .	In department stores and closets all over the world, they are waiting. Their outward appearance seems rather appealing because they come in a variety of styles, patterns, materials, and color1s. But they are eventually the biggest deception that exists in the fashion industry today. What are they? They are high heels -- a woman's worst enemy (whether she knows it or not). High heel shoes are the downfall of modern society. Fashion myths have led women to believe that they are more beautiful or stylish for wearing heels, but in reality, heels succeed in creating short as well as long term troubles. Women should fight the high heel industry by refusing to use or purchase them in order to save the world from unnecessary physical and psychological suffering. For the sake of fairness, it must be noted that there is a positive side to high heels. First, heels are excellent for aerating lawns . Anyone who has ever worn heels on grass knows what I am talking about. A simple trip around the yard in a pair of those babiesgets rid of all the need to call for a lawn care specialist, and provides the perfect-sized holes to give any lawn oxygen without all those messy blocks of dirt lying around. Second, heels are quite functional for defending against oncoming enemies, who can easily be scared away by threatening them with a pair of these sharp, deadly fashion items. Regardless of such practical uses for heels, the fact remains that wearing high heels is harmful to one's physical health. Talk to any podiatrist , and you will hear that the majority of their business comes from high-heel-wearing women. High heels are known to cause problems such as misshapen feet and torn toenails. The risk of severe back problems and twisted or broken ankles is three times higher for a high heel wearer than for a flat shoe wearer. Wearing heels also creates the threat of getting a heel caught in a narrow sidewalk gap and being thrown to the ground--possibly breaking a nose, back, or neck. And of course, after wearing heels for a day, any woman knows she can look forward to a night of pain as she tries to comfort her aching feet.	"[""they are harmful to women's health""]"
What did Mrs. White decide to do when she found another ten pounds in her neighbor's handbag on the bus?	"One day Mr. White gave his wife ten pounds for her birthday -- ten new pound notes. So Mrs. White went out shopping. She waited for a bus, got on it and sat down next to an o1d 1ady. After a while, Mrs. White noticed that the old 1ady's handbag was open. Inside it, she saw a wad of pound notes exactly like the ones her husband had given her. So she quickly looked into her own bag -- the notes had gone! Mrs. White was sure that the o1d lady next to her had stolen them. She immediately thought of calling the police. But as she disliked making a fuss , she decided to take back the money from the old 1ady's hand bag and say nothing about it. She looked around to make sure nobody was watching. Then she carefully put her hand into the o1d lady's bag, took the notes, and put them into her own handbag. When she got home that evening, Mrs. White showed her husband the beautiful hat she had bought. ""How did you pay for it?"" Mr. White asked. ""With the money you gave me for my birthday, of course"" she answered. ""Oh? What's that, then?"" he asked, as he pointed to a wad of pound notes on the table."

In the speaker's opinion, what is the key to success in our times?	"Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you. Well, ni-hao. (Laughter) It is such a pleasure and an honor to be here with all of you at this great university, so thank you so much for having me. I'm here today because I know that our future depends on connections like these among young people like you across the world. That's why when my husband and I travel abroad, we don't just visit palaces and parliaments and meet with heads of countries. We also come to schools like this one to meet with students like you, because we believe that relationships between countries aren't just about relationships between governments or leaders -- they're about relationships between people, particularly young people. So we view study abroad programs not just as an educational chance for students, but also as an active part of America's foreign policy . Through the wonders of modern technology, our world is more connected than ever before. Ideas can cross oceans with the click of a mouse. Companies can do business and _ with companies across the world. And we can text, email, Skype with people in the world. So studying abroad isn't just a fun way to spend a time of learning; it is quickly becoming the key to success in our times. Because getting ahead in today's workplaces isn't just about getting good grades or test scores in school, which are important. It's also about having real experience with the world beyond your borders -- experience with languages, cultures and societies very different from your own. Or, as the Chinese saying goes: ""It is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books."""	['Studying abroad.']
People celebrated birthdays many centuries ago to _ .	"Many centuries ago, birthdays were considered a time when the bad spirits were able to harm you. It was believed that you should have your friends and family around you so that their good wishes and present-giving would keep the bad spirits away. People also believed that, by lighting candles, they were sending a signal or wishes to the gods. Later on, candles started to be used on birthday cakes. One story about the beginnings of the birthday cake is that it started with the Greeks, who made round cakes standing for the full moon for their moon goddess . They also placed candles on the cake to make it light, again like the moon. However, the Germans are said to have first used cakes and candles. They used a sweet cake and they put a large candle in the centre of the cake to mean ""the light of life"". The ""Happy Birthday"" song is more than a hundred years old. The music was written in 1893 by two sisters, Patty and Mildred Hill, who were schoolteachers in Louisville, Kentucky. The music was first used as a morning greeting to their students with the title, ""Good Morning To All"". In 1935, the words legally belonged to the Hill sisters, and the copyright has been bought and sold for millions of dollars ever since. The present copyright is owned by Warner Communications. They bought it in 1989 for more than $22 million."	['keep the bad spirits away']
Horse-racing fans can't be exactly considered as sportsmen because they _ .	The United States is a sports-loving nation. Sports in America take various forms: organized competitive struggles, athletic games, hunting and fishing. Most sports are seasonal, so that what is happening in sports depends upon the time of year. Baseball is the most popular sport in the US. It is played throughout the spring and summer, and professional baseball teams play well into the fall. Football is the most popular sport in the fall. The game originated as a college sport more than 75 years ago. It's not the same as European football or soccer. In American football there are 11 players as well on each team, and they are dressed in padded uniforms and helmets because the game is rough and injuries are likely to occur. It is still played by almost every college and university in the country. Basketball is the winner sport in American schools and colleges. Like football, basketball originated in the US, many Americans prefer it to football because it is played indoors throughout the winter and because it is a faster game. And the famous NBA games are considered the best of this game. Other sports attracting a great many people include wrestling, boxing and horse racing. Although horse-racing fans call themselves sportsmen, the exactness of the term is questionable, as only the jockeys who ride the horses in the races can be considered athletes. The so-called sportsmen are the spectators, who do not come primarily to see the horses race, but to bet upon the outcome of each race. Gambling is the attraction of horse racing.

"What does Roosegaarde really mean by saying ""Beijing is quite a good place...... ""?"	"A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device which he hopes will get rid of pollutants from Beijing's smog skies, creating clean air for the city's mask-wearing people. An electromagnetic field will pull particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. ""It's like when you have a balloon which has static and your hair goes toward it. Same with the smog,"" says artist Daan Roosegaarde. His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of tile capital's parks. With its skies regularly covered by dirty gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to handle the problem. Roosegaarde says an indoor model device has already proven it works and is confident that the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside. ""Beijing is quite a good place because the smog in Beijing is quite low. It lies in a valley so there's not so much wind. It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing."" ""We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again."" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a practical solution to Beijing's awful air pollution. ""This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles."" However, he hopes the project will make a ""fundamental statement"" by allowing the city's people to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air."

The passage mainly tells us _ .	"Their reunion was unlike any other. Graduating from the Macon, Georgia, class of 1959 gathered together in 2009, even though many of them never had an opportunity to meet during their high school days. Schools in the 1950's, like most other public locations, were segregated in Georgia. Kids were forced to attend different schools depending on the color1 of their skin, and those with white skin were further separated by gender. Fifty years later these people who were not allowed to associate with each other were finally able to connect. It all began with the personal journey of a man named Tom Johnson. He grew up in Macon and enjoyed a very successful career which included serving as the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and president of CNN. Tom's life changed drastically over the years, but he still felt the desire to reconnect with his roots. In 2005 Johnson returned to Macon with his son, Wyatt. As the pair drove around town, the father recounted high school stories to his son. He talked about how students attended one of three schools: BallardHudson, Lanier or Miller. Wyatt looked over at his father and said:""Dad think about how many friends you missed getting to know."" Johnson thought about the people he never got the chance to meet. He decided to do something about it. The first step was to find people who graduated from all three schools. Johnson wrote to each person and proposed they all get together for a luncheon. He explained that even though they were kept apart during their youth, they didn't have to be separated any more. His classmates received the message with open hearts. A reunion date was set for October. More than 200 former Macon students traveled hundreds of miles to reunite with people who went to high school with them. It was an unprecedented event, former students coming together to make up for the time they had lost during the days of segregation."	['an unusual reunion of old graduates']

The title of the passage should be _	"Ann Whimey, a sophomore at Colorado State University, first had a problem taking tests when she began college. ""I was always well prepared for my tests. Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer."" The young student was experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the great nervousness. though poor scores are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety causes low scores. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students. Special university counseling courses try to help students. In these courses, counselors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the test shows their anxiety is high, the students can take courses to help them deal with their nervousness. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease, learn information, then come out without difficulty in a test. An expert at the University of California explains, ""With almost all students, relaxation is felt after taking our program. Most of them have better control during their test. Almost all have some improvements. For some, the improvement is very great."	['Anxiety and Tests']
Dave went go Big Bear twice a year mainly to_.	Dave needed to prepare for Saturday's fishing trip. He went into his hall closet, where he had more than 20 rods and reels. Nowadays he went fishing twice a year at Big Bear, a huge lake in southern prefix = st1 /Californiaabout 7,000 feet up in the mountains. California tries to improve the fishing industry by sponsoring a Free Fishing Day twice a ear, once in June and once in September. That's enough for Dave. He went mostly because it was a social event with a few friends, not so much to catch fish. Even driving up a twisty two-lane road was worth the trip. Let alone the big, beautiful houses and trees that lined the shore of the lake. Preparing was a project in itself. Dace had even created a computer file named Fishing Trip. It was a checklist of 45 things to take to Big Bear. He took two rods, because on Free Fishing Day you were allowed to fish with two rods instead of the usual one rod. He took a sweatshirt, jeans, two pairs of socks, a heavy hooded jacket, winter gloves, and a scarf. He also took flip-flops, shorts, a T-shirt, sunglasses, a big hat, and lightweight raincoat. If you go to Big Bear in June, you'd better be prepared for hot or cold, rain or shine. He prepared a couple of magazines to read just in case the fish weren't biting. He and his friends joked that the fish were always biting- in the spot you just left or the spot you were headed for. After about an hour and a half; Dave had gathered all the items on his list into a neat pile next to his door. He went to bed knowing that tomorrow's weather and fishing were unpredictable, but the good time with his friends was a given.	['meet his friends']
Now Nasa researchers' aim is to _ .	"As motorways become more and more blocked up with traffic, a new generation on flying cars will be needed to ferry people along skyways. That is the conclusion of engineers from the US space agency and aeronautical firms, who _ future commuters traveling by ""skycar"". These could look much like the concept skycar shown in the picture, designed by Boeing research and development. However, such vehicles could be some 25 years from appearing on the market. Efforts to build flying vehicles in the past have not been very successful. Such vehicles would not only be expensive and require the skills of a trained pilot to fly, but there are significant engineering challenges involved in developing them. ""When you try to combine them you get the worst of both worlds: a very heavy, slow, expensive vehicle that's hard to use,"" said Mark Moore, head of the personal air vehicle(PAV) division of the vehicle systems program at Nasa's Langley Research Center in Hampton, US. But Boeing is also considering how to police the airways and prevent total pandemonium -if thousands of flying cars enter the skies. ""The neat, gee-whiz part is thinking about what the vehicle itself would look like,"" said Dick Paul, a vice president with Phantom Works, Boeing's research and development arm. ""But we're trying to think through all the consequences of what it would take to deploy a fleet of these."" Past proposals to solve this problem have included artificial intelligence systems to prevent collisions between air traffic. Nasa is working on flying vehicles with the initial goal of transforming small plane travel. Small planes are generally costly, loud, and require months of training and lots of money to operate, making flying to work impractical for most people. But within five years, Nasa researchers hope to develop technology for a small plane that can fly out of regional airports, costs less than $100,000(PS55,725), is as quiet as a motorcycle and as simple to operate as a car. Although it would not have any road-driving capabilities, it would bring this form of travel within the grasp of a wider section of people. The new technology would automate many of the pilot's functions. This Small Aircraft Transportation System(Sats) would divert pressure away from the ""hub-and-spoke "" model of air travel. Hub-and-spoke refers to the typically US model of passengers being processed through large ""hub"" airports and then on to secondary flights to ""spoke"" airports near their final destinations."

Who wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?	"Have you ever read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland? It was written by Lewis Carroll. He was an English writer, poet, scientist, photographer, and priest. His real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and Lewis Carroll was his pen name. He was born in 1832 and died in 1898. He is most famous for writing two children's fantasy books about a young girl called Alice. They were titled Alice's Adventures in Wonderland(1865) and through the looking-Glass(1872). He also wrote two famous poems called ""The Hunting of the Snark"" and ""The Jabberwocky"". What is important about these poems is that he made up many new words to use in them. He was an expert at ""word play"" and used words in many different ways. Some of these ways were quite new. And this has influenced members of the literary elite who are well educated about English. Many people still study his work and his life today. Although they seem to have been written for children, Lewis Carroll's books and poems have been enjoyed by people of all ages. If you have not read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which is also referred to by the short title Alice in Wonderland, you should read it soon. No matter how old you are, you will find it exciting and enjoyable."	['Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.']

Which of the following is TRUE, according to the passage?	"Once upon a time, a man was walking on a mountain when he found an incredible cave with all kinds of treasure inside it. So he gave up his job, his home, and his friends, and spent all his time guarding the cave. He was so dedicated to it that he hardly ate or drank, and before long he fell ill. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he decided to share the treasure. He crawled into the cave to get a handful of jewels, but discovered, to his horror, that it was empty except for a small emerald . The man took it, and gave it to the first person he came by, a woman. Then an old man came by. ""What bad luck!"" the man said. ""Just a moment ago I gave a woman the last of the treasure I was guarding."" ""Are you sure there is nothing left?"" the old man asked. The man took him into the cave, where they found a chest with jewels and some bags of gold. The man was shocked, and the old man explained to him, ""At last! At last someone has broken the spell of this cave. This is the Cave of Treasure, and you're the first to have passed its great test. Many have dedicated their lives to this cave, only to end up realizing there was nothing here..."" ""And why does this happen?"" the man asked. ""This magic cave has only as many riches as your own heart. When someone discovers it, the cave is filled with treasure, but later, when they have devoted themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts empty, as does the cave. The only way to fill it is by filling your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving the woman that last jewel."" From that day on, the man understood that it was better to share than to keep. Thanks to the cave and the old man, he became noble and generous."	['The cave and the old man helped the man become noble and generous.']
According to the passage, Bunyan hated the rich people mainly because _ .	"British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628. His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his ""Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners."" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. Like most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth ""by hook and by crook."" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. Bunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. Bunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). The Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. ""The Vanity Fair,"" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed."	['the rich usually got their wealth in dishonest ways']

Elephants touch the bones of their own kind to _ .	Elephants are the only species on the earth known to have death ritual besides man. They show a strong interest in the bones of their own kind.They are often seen gently touching the bones with their trunks and feet while remaining very quiet.Sometimes elephants completely unrelated to the dead will still visit their graves. Elephant researcher Meredith recalls something in his book about a typical elephant death ritual.The entire family of a dead elephant,including her young baby,were all gently touching her body with their trunks,trying to lift her. The elephant herd were all rumbling :The baby elephant was even observed to be weeping and made sounds that sounded like a scream,but then the entire herd fell incredibly silent.Then they began to throw leaves and dirt over the body and broke off tree branches to cover her.They spent the next two days quietly standing over her body.They sometimes had to leave to get water or food,but they would always return. Events of elephants behaving this way around human beings are common throughout Africa. On many occasions,they have buried dead or sleeping humans or helped them when they are hurt. An old woman fell asleep under a tree.When she woke up,there was an elephant standing over her,gently touching her.She kept very still because she was frightened.As other elephants arrived,they began to scream loudly and buried her under branches.She was found the next morning by the local people,unharmed. George Adamson also recalls when he shot all elephant from a herd that kept breaking into the farmers'gardens.George gave the:elephant's meat to 1ocal men and then dragged the rest of the body miles away.That night,the other elephants found the body,took the leg bones,returned them to the exact spot the elephant was killed,and made the death ritual.

From which section of a newspaper can you read this passage?	"When Marilynne Robinson published her first novel, Housekeeping, in 1980, she was unknown in the literary world. But an early review in The New York Times ensured that the book would be noticed. ""It's as if, in writing it, she broke through the ordinary human condition with all its dissatisfactions, and achieved a kind of transfiguration ,"" wrote Anatole Broyard, with an enthusiasm and amazement that was shared by many critics and readers. The book became a classic, and Robinson was recognized as one of the outstanding American writers of our time. Yet it would be more than twenty years before she wrote another novel. During the period, Robinson devoted herself to writing nonfiction. Her essays and book reviews appeared in Harper's and The New York Times Book Review, and in 1989 she published Mother Country: Britain, the Welfare State, and Nuclear Pollution, criticizing severely the environmental and public health dangers caused by the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in England--and the political and moral corruption . In 1998, Robinson published a collection of her critical and theological writings, The Death of Adam: Essays on Modern Thought, which featured reassessments of such figures as Charles Darwin, John Calvin, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Aside from a single short story--""Connie Bronson,"" published in The Paris Review in 1986--it wasn't until 2004 that she returned to fiction with the novel Gilead, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Her third novel, Home, came out this fall. Her novels could be described as celebrations of the human--the characters in them are unforgettable creations. Housekeeping is the story of Ruth and her sister Lucille, who are cared for by their eccentric Aunt Sylvie after their mother commits suicide. Robinson writes a lot about how each of the three is changed by their new life together. Gilead is an even more close exploration of personality: the book centres on John Ames, a seventy-seven-year-old pastor who is writing an account of his life and his family history to leave to his young son after he dies. Home borrows characters from Gilead but centers on Ames's friend Reverend Robert Boughton and his troubled son Jack. Robinson returned to the same territory as Gilead because, she said, ""after I write a novel or a story, I miss the characters--I feel like losing some close friends."""	['Culture.']

Compared with corn and soybeans,algae _ .	"With petroleum reserves decreasing,the search is on to replace gas with a cleaner,greener alternative.Though much eco-talk has centered on biofuels from corn and soybeans,the biofuel that looks more likely to replace petroleum comes from a most unlikely source:algae . Algae,like corn,soybeans,and other crops,grow via photosynthesis and can be processed into fuel oil.However,they _ 30 times more energy than land crops such as soybeans,according to the U.S.Department of Energy.Many algae species also can grow in saltwater and polluted water-while corn and soy require arable land and fresh water that will be in short supply as the world's population balloons. ""If you replaced all the diesel in the U.S.with soy biodiesel,it would take half the land mass of the U.S.to grow those soybeans,""says Matt Caspari,chief executive of Aurora Biofuels,a Berkeley,Calif.-based private firm that specializes in algae oil technology.On the other hand,the Energy Department says that if algae fuel replaced all the petroleum fuel in the United States,it would require 15,000 square miles,which is a few thousand miles larger that Maryland (12,407 square miles),the 42nd state in land area. Another bonus:Because algae can be grown just about anywhere in a closed space,they 're being tested at several power plants across the nation as a carbon absorber.Smokestack emissions can be pumped directly into the ponds,feeding the algae while keeping greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Although processing technology for algae fuel--also known as ""oilgae"" in some environmentalist circles--is improving,it's still years away from reaching your local gas pump.""It's just a question of cost,because no large-scale facilities have been built yet,"" Caspari says."

"The word ""tomb"" probably means the same as the word "" _ "" in the passage."	"Pure Brightness Festival, also known as Tomb-sweeping Day in China, falls on the 4thor 5thof April each year. It was started in the Han Dynasty. On this day, whole families, young and old, with flowers visit the graves of their ancestors to pay their respects. Following the custom, tomb sweepers clean and tidy the graves, decorate them with flowers. They burn paper money made for the dead, set off firecrackers and bow before their ancestors' tombstones. On this day, they don't cook. Only cold food is served. However, tomb sweeping is not the only activity during Pure Brightness Festival. This day is also a time for people to enjoy themselves. Other activities include spring outing, flying kites, planting trees, tasting tea and so on. In April, everything in nature takes on a new look. Trees turn green, flowers come out and the sun shines brightly. So it is a good time to be out to appreciate the beauty of nature. People fly kites not only in the daytime but at night. In the dark, some people fly kites with lanterns, which are called ""God's lanterns"". They plant trees because young trees which are planted during this period are easy to grow up.

The researchers consider the people fat if _ .	A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began. The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married.	['they are in the top of the measurement in which weight is linked to height.']
The main idea of the passage is that _ .	Do you want to know something about the history of weather? Don't look at the sky. Don't look for old weather reports. Looking at tree rings is more important. Correct weather reports date back only one century, but some trees can provide an exact record of the weather even further back. It is natural that a tree would grow best in a climate with plenty of sunlight and rainfall. It is also expected that little sunlight and rainfall would limit the growth of a tree. The change from a favorable to an unfavorable climate can be determined by reading the pattern of rings in a tree trunk. To find the weather of ten years ago, count the rings of a tree trunk from the outside to the inside. If the tenth ring is far from the other rings, then it is certain that plenty of sunny and rainy weather occurred. If the rings are closed together, then the climate was bad for the tree. Studying tree rings is important not only for the history of weather, but also for the history of man. In a region of New Mexico you can find only sand---no trees and no people. However, many centuries ago a large population lived there. They left suddenly. Why? A scientist studied patterns of dead tree rings which had grown there. He decided that the people had to leave because they had cut down all the trees. Trees were necessary to make fires and buildings. So, after the people destroyed the trees, they had to move. In this instance studying tree rings uncovers an exciting fact about the history of man.	['tree rings reflect the history of weather and the history of man']
The study of scientists proved that _ .	"Apparently your mom had it right when she threatened to wash your mouth out with soap if you talked dirty. Lying really does create a desire to clean the ""dirty"" body part, according to a study by University of Michigan. ""The references to 'dirty hands' or 'dirty mouths' in everyday language suggest that people think about abstract issues of moral purity in terms of more experiences with physical purity,"" said Spike W.S. Lee, a U-M doctoral candidate, who conducted the study with Norbert Schwarz, a psychologist at the U-M Institute for Social Research (ISR), the Ross School of Business, and the U-M psychology department. For the study, Lee and Schwarz asked 87 students to play the role of lawyers competing with a colleague, ""Chris"", for a promotion. Each was asked to imagine they found an important document that Chris had lost, and that returning the document would help his career and hurt their own career. Each participant was instructed to leave Chris a message by either voice mail or email, telling him who they were and either lying that they could not find his document or telling the truth that they had found the document. Next, participants rated the desirability of several products as part of a supposed marketing survey and reported how much they were willing to pay for each product. The products included mouthwash and hand sanitizer . Study participants who lied on the phone, leaving an untrue and mean voicemail, felt a stronger desire for mouthwash and were willing to pay more for it than those who lied on e-mail. And conversely, those who lied on e-mail, typing the same mean message, felt a stronger desire for hand sanitizer and were willing to pay more for _ . Saying nice and morally correct things, on the other hand, made it less appealing to clean the body part involved in conveying the message. In scientific terms, the findings showed that the embodiment of moral purity is specific to the modality involved in the moral misbehavior. Verbal lying increased participants' assessment of mouthwash while lying on e-mail, using their hands, increased the assessment of hand sanitizer's value. ""This study shows how 'concrete' the symbolic links are between abstract and concrete domains of life,"" Schwarz said. ""Not only do people want to clean after a dirty deed, they want to clean the specific body part involved."""	['there is a need to clean the body part that lies']

Which of the following can serve as the best title for the passage?	"Instagram is containing so many photos of food--now a pop-up diner in London is taking advantage of this new trend by letting people settle the bill for their meals simply by uploading photos of their dishes to social networks. I always thought people's taking pictures of their food was kind of silly, but at this new pop-up restaurant in the UK, I'd probably do it too. 'The Picture House' is the world's first pay-by-photo restaurant--you order, click a photo of the food, share on Instagram and eat for free! The restaurant belongs to frozen food giant Birds Eye, who came up with the idea to cash in on people's addiction with photographing food and sharing the pictures online. They conducted a survey and found out that more than half of the British population regularly took pictures of their meals. So they realized it was a better way to advertise their new dining range. The pop-up diner was open in Soho, London for three days in May, and is now moving to other major UK cities. They serve two-course meals that customers don't have to pay for, if they photo and Instagram it. The restaurant is a part of Birds Eye's 'Food for Life' campaign, a new marketing project that aims at changing the way people look at frozen food. ""Taking photos of food enables people to show off and to share their mealtime moments--from the everyday to the special,"" said marketing director Margaret Jobling. The reaction to The Picture House has been great so far. And the pay-by-picture concept has proven to be an effective way. Alternative payment methods are actually gaining popularity among a lot of businesses. Last year, in a cafe in Germany customers pay by how much time they spend there, not by what they eat."

The producers of 'Smart' watches were given the order because they promised _ .	Sirs, Your twelve thousand 'Smart' watches were received by our company this morning. However, we wish to make a number of complaints concerning the serious delay in delivery and your failure to carry out our instructions regard to this order. It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders. The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you. We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault. As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory. We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company. We look forward to your early reply. Yours sincerely, John Smith	['they had enough ready-made watches to ship']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"Mum gives little Jerry twenty yuan. Then little Jerry goes shopping. He gets on a bus and sits down next to an old woman. Then he sees the old woman's bag is open. There is twenty yuan in it. He quickly looks into his pocket. The money isn't there now! Little Jerry is sure that the old woman is a thief . He wants to take back the money from the old woman's bag. He carefully puts his hands into the old woman's bag, takes the money and says nothing. Then, the old woman shouts, ""Where is my money? I can't find it. There is a thief on the bus."" Little Jerry feels strange . Then he sees twenty yuan under his seat. Little Jerry is thinking a question now, ""Am I a thief?"""	['Little Jerry makes a mistake .']
The Great Fire of London destroyed more than _ of the old city.	The Great Fire of London started in the very early hours of September 2,1666.In four days it destroyed more than three quarters of the old city,where most of those houses were built out of wood and close together.One hundred thousand people became homeless but only few lost their lives.The fire started on Sunday moring.By eight o'clock three hundred houses were on fire.On Monday nearly a kilometer of the city was burning along the River Thames.Tuesday was the worst day.The fire destroyed many well-known buildings. The fire stopped only when the king finally ordered people to destroy hundreds of buildings in the path of the fire.With nothing left to burn,the fire became weak and finally died out.	['75 percent']
What does the author think of the Social Security system ?	"Age has its special advantages inprefix = st1 /America. And one of the more impressive of them is the senior citizen discount . Anyone who has reached a certain age-- in some cases as low as 55 -- is automatically entitled to plenty of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life . Eligibility is determined not by one's need but by the date on one's birth certificate . Practically the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses-- as common as color1 televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners . People with array hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them ; yet , millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent . Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans . The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that "" elderly "" and "" needy "" are synonymous . Perhaps that once was true , but today , to be sure , there is economic variety within the elderly , and most of them aren't poor . It is impossible to determine the effect of the discounts on individual companies . For many firms , they are a stimulus to income . But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense , directly or indirectly , of younger Americans . Moreover , they directly annoy some politicians and scholars who consider it a coming conflict between the generations . Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits , which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old . Employment is another point . Supported by laws and court decisions , more and more older Americans are refusing the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job-- thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers . Far from a kind of charity they once were , senior citizen discounts have become a powerful economic privilege to a group with millions of members who don't need them . It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others . Senior citizen discounts only enrich the myth that older people can't take care of themselves and need special treatment ; and they threaten the creation of a new myth , that the elderly are ungrateful and taking for themselves at the expense of children and other age groups . Senior citizen discounts are the heart of the very thing older Americans are fighting against-- discrimination by age ."	['It benefits the old at the expense of the young']
What can be the best title of the passage?	"Half a year before graduation from college, my son David began to seek a job. Due to the financial crisis, the competition was ever-fierce. My son targeted a company that was located in a coastal city. It was intended to employ only one person among more than twenty candidates, I said to David, ""You should not harbor too much hope for fear that you would feel terribly disappointed when you fail."" He said to me, ""I am not afraid of disappointment. As long as I try, there will always be hope!"" Three young men could enter the final round, which would later decide one person to be employed. Everything seemed to go quite well and David entered the final round in a week. Unexpectedly, the interview was unbelievably simple, during which the interviewer only chatted with them for a while. The interview strategies my son prepared were not useful at all. The interviewer said the company would inform them of the result in 3 days. On the morning of the third day, David received the text from the company that he was not employed. David felt disappointed. In nightfall that day, David suddenly told me excitedly on phone that he had been employed. Greatly surprised, I asked him, ""What's the whole matter?"" David told me that he received another text saying that he was employed. David felt very confused about it. Later he found out the first text sent to him was also part of the test in the interview. Three men received the same text this morning and only David's reply was satisfying to the company. I asked my son, ""How did all of you reply?"" My son said, ""One did not reply. The other said ""goodbye"" and I said ""thank you""."" Only then did I know that my son's ""hope"" came in that way. That is, when you feel disappointed, do not forget to say ""Thank you"" to the one who disappoints you. Actually, it is a piece of cake to say ""Thank you"". Saying ""Thank you"" shows respect for others' work and demonstrates your grand generosity. Therefore, while under the same condition, you will get the upper hand in terms of opportunities compared with others!"	"['The Magic Power of ""Thank You""']"
The author is most probably from _ .	All countries have little known interesting facts about them, including Canada. For example, did you know that although Canada is the second largest county with only 30 million people, making it the 28thlargest in population? Because a large part of Canada is covered with lakes and streams, it has the largest source of fresh water in the world. The US has a lot of automobiles on the road. Canada has more automobiles per person than any other country, with at least one automobile for every 2 people. And in Canada, 100 different languages are spoken. Did you know that the Canadian $1 coin is called the Loonie, named after a bird pictured on the coin? Are there any other animals featured on Canadian coins? Yes. The caribou is displayed on the Canadian quarter. Did you also know that Canada has six time zones? Some of the things we love most in America were created by Canadians. Superman, the chocolate nut bar, basketball, and Ginger Ale were all created by Canadians. Famous inventions that are used by many Americans are credited to Canadians including the walker, used by the elderly or the injured, the common garbage bag, the electric cooking range, and the electric light bulb (even though most people think it was invented by Thomas Edison). To make our lives easier, Canadians invented the instant mashed potatoes, paint rollers, snow blowers, the wireless radio and the zipper . For communication or fun, the Canadians invented the television, walkie-talkies, telephone, and the snowmobile. There are many famous people who were born in Canada, including Pamela Anderson, Shania Twain, Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Tilley.	['America']
Which of the following is true about the name Lego?	"The Lego Group had a very low beginning in the workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen,a carpenter from Denmark.Christiansen began creating wooden toys in 1932.Two years later, he came upon the Lego name by putting together the first two letters of the Danish words Leg and Godt,which mean ""play well.""The name could be interpreted as ""I put together"" in Latin;it is also similar to the Greek verb meaning ""gather"" or ""pick up"". In 1947,the company enlarged to making plastic toys.At first,the use of plastic for toy production was not highly regarded by salesmen and consumers of the time.Many of the Lego Group's shipments were returned,following poor sales.However, Christiansen's son,Godtfred Kirk Christiansen,saw the great potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play-As the junior managing director of the Lego Group,he spent years trying to improve the ""locking"" ability of the bricks and made the bricks more versatile .In 1958, the modem interlocking brick design was finally developed and patented . Today Lego is sold in more than 1 30 countries.Every minute 33,824 Lego bricks are made,and kids around the world spend 5 billion hours a year playing with Lego.There will be more than 400 million people playing with Lego bricks this year.On average,every person in the world owns 62 Lego bricks,and about seven Lego sets are sold every second. This year Lego fans all over the world are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the tiny building blocks.Though already 50 years old,Lego is still the same product it was in the 1950s. Bricks bought then are still compatible with present bricks and that is probably the reason the toy has never fallen out of favor."	"['It came from Danish words meaning ""play"" and ""well.""']"
Which of the following is true about memory?	"We take it for granted that with memory we can remember most of things which happened in our life. But it is difficult to imagine what life would be like without memory. The meanings of thousands of everyday perceptions , the basis for the decisions we make, and the roots of our habits and skills are to be found in our past experiences, which are brought into the present by memory. Memory can be defined as the ability to keep information available for later use. It not only includes ""remembering"" things like arithmetic or historical facts, but also involves any change in the way an animal typically behaves. Memory is involved when a rat gives up eating grain because he has sniffed something suspicious in the grain pile. Memory exists not only in humans and animals but also in some physical objects and machines. Computers, for example, contain devices for storing data for later use. It is interesting to compare the memory storage capacity of a computer with that of a human being. The instant access memory of a large computer may hold up to 100,000 ""words""--strings of alphabetic or numerical characters--ready for instant use. An average U.S. teenager probably recognizes the meaning of about 1000,000 words of English. However, this is but a part of the total amount of information that the teenager has stored. Consider, for example, the number of faces and places that the teenager can recognize on sight. The use of words is the basis of the advanced problem solving intelligence of human beings. A large part of a person's memory is in terms of words and combinations of words. But while language greatly expands the number and the kind of things a person can remember, it also requires a huge memory capacity. It may well be this capacity that distinguishes humans, setting them apart from other animals."	['It connects our past experiences with the present.']
What worried the writer when Peggy greeted the young runner?	It was an early September day, cool and bright and just right for running, and I was in the first few miles of a lO-knownmile race over a course with a few high hills. Still, I felt energetic; despite the hills it was going to be a fine run. Just ahead of me was Peggy Mimno, a teacher from Mount Kiseo, New York. She too was running easily, moving along at my speed. The pace felt comfortable, so I decided to stay where I was; why pay attention to pace when she was setting such a nice one? I'd overtake her later on when she tired. So I ran behind her. The course headed north for miles, wandered west for a hilly mile, then turned south again along a winding road. The race was getting harder. We had four miles left and already it was beginning to be real work. Peggy overtook a young runner. She seemed to know him, for they exchanged a few cheerful words as she passed him. Their exchange worried me. You don't chat during a race unless you feeling good, and Peggy plainly was. Still, I was close enough to overtake her if she tired, so I didn't give up hope completely. We were getting nearer to a long, punishing hill now and it would be the test. We were a mile from the finish line, so whatever happened on the hill would almost determine who crossed it first. As I moved up the hill, my attention wandered for a few minutes. When I looked up, Peggy was moving away--first five yards, then ten, then more. Finally it was clear that there was no help of catching her. She beat me soundly. There is an important lesson in that race. Women are thought to be weaker, slower and not nearly as skilled in sport. Yet as Peggy Mimno so clearly showed, the similarities between men and women runners are more important than differences. I have run with a number of women, and I can say it is often hard work.	['Peggy paid no attention to the writer.']

What do dogs begin to do just before an earthquake?	"According to some predictions, human beings will die out in 2012. Nearly all people think it's impossible, but there are some more earthquakes in recent years. Animals can predict the weather or other natural events. It may sound strange, but farmers living in the countryside think so. For hundreds of years , they have observed animals. ""Animals ' behavior can be connected to future weather conditions or events."" They say. For example, if cows lie down, a rainstorm is coming. There are many traditional stories connecting animals and natural events. Many people think that these stories don't have scientific evidence( ) at all. Scientists, however, are beginning to take another look at some of these ideas. A Japanese earthquake researcher named Kiyoshi Shimamura noticed an increase in dog bites a short time before earthquake hit. Then he did research on twelve public health centers in Kobe, Japan. These health centers treated people after the 1995 earthquake . He got some interesting information about the month before the big earthquake: treatment for animals' bites had increased . In fact, aggressive behavior in dogs, such as biting and barking loudly , jumped 60 percent. There are also other changes in animals' behavior before the earthquake. For example, fish began swimming together in large groups , but only in the middle of the water and not near the edges. Birds flew away from their nests for many days, leaving their eggs unprotected . These animals' behavior suggests that animals may be able to predict natural events better than people."	['They hurt people.']
Who are the intended readers of this passage?	"So far, scientists have named about 1.8 million living species ,and that's just a small part of what probably exists on Earth.With so many plants,animals,fungi,and other organisms covering the planet,it can be tough to figure out what type of spider is crawling up your leg or what kind of bird just flew by. A soon-to-be-launched Website might help.An international team of researchers has announced the creation of a Web -- based Encyclopedia of Life (EOL).The project aims to catalogue every species on Earth in a single,easy-to-use reference guide. To get the encyclopedia started,the creators will use information from scientific databases that already exist.And eventually,in special sections of the site,nonscientists with specialized knowledge will join.Gardeners,for example,will be able to record the dates that their flowers first bloom each year.Bird-watchers will be able to input which birds they've seen and where.The technology for this kind of tool has only recently become available. As the EOL develops, you might find it useful for school projects.The site will have special pages for kids who are studying ecosystems in their neighborhoods.To make sure the encyclopedia is accurate,scientists will review much of the information added to it.People who visit the site will be able to choose to skip pages that haven't been reviewed. Another convenient characteristic of the EOL is that you'11 be able to pick the level of detail you see to match your interests,age,and current knowledge. If you wanted to learn about polar bears for a science class report,for example,you could use the _ setting to get basic information about the animals.On the ""expert"" setting,on the other hand.you could get much more detailed information about the history,literature,and exploration of polar bears. It now takes years for scientists to collect all the data they need to describe and analyze species.The creators of the Encyclopedia of Life hope that their new tool will speed that process. Keep an eye on _ .Pages will begin to go up sometime next year,and you might find them useful for your school reports.The EOL team might have the basics for all 1.8 million entries online as early as 2017.Someday,you might add your own notes."

_ was a kind-hearted man.	"One day a pilot and three people were in a plane. When the plane was flying in the sky, there was something wrong with it. The smoke was everywhere in the plane. The pilot told the people there were only three parachutes . They all became worried. ""I must go because I'm the best pilot in the world."" said the pilot, then he jumped out with one parachute. The next person said, ""I must have a parachute. I am a very clever person, and I have to take part in an important meeting."" he jumped out with another parachute. Two men were left, an old businessman and a young mountain climber. By this time the plane was going down faster and faster. The businessman said, ""Young man, I am old but you're still young. You take the last parachute. "" The young mountain climber smiled, ""Don't worry, we are both safe, because there are still two parachutes. The clever person jumped out with my backpack."""

The purpose of writing this passage is to _ .	"Maybe you've just invented something better than the iPhone or a solar-powered car. You don't want anyone to steal your design. What should you do? Patent it! Patents are the best way to get credit for your work and help others continue advancing in that field. Here's what you need to know. A patent gives you the right to an invention. The patent protects its owner, which means the invention can't be copied or sold without their agreement. In exchange, the owner must reveal information about the invention. This contributes knowledge that helps other inventors improve on their own research. A patent usually lasts about 20 years. The first step to getting a patent is the application. The person applying must name the invention, explain its use and describe it clearly. The invention must be practical and contain some new characteristic -- something that hasn't been seen or used before. But not everything ""new"" can be patented. Many countries don't allow patents on things like new concepts, scientific theories, medical procedures or substances already found in nature. You may not be able to see patents, but they're connected to nearly everything. There are patents on things you use every day, like plastic, medicine and your computer. There are patents on things that are unavailable on the market, too. Apple is well-known for its patents on potential products, such as the ""iBike"" or the ""iKey"". Of course there are also patents on inventions like this. Take the anti-eating face mask for example. This _ locks around your head with a metal cage covering your mouth. You can breathe and speak, but you can't eat! Although many patented inventions can be failures, there's plenty of room for success. So if you have a cool invention, try to patent it."	['inform']
What can help memorize a big number more easily according to the passage?	"The human brain weighs about 1.4 kilograms, but it can, hold much more information than most computers. However, there is another difference between humans and computers. Computers don't forget information they are given, but humans often do. No one remembers everything, and luckily we don't usually have to. But everyone can improve their memory if they want to. Here are some suggestions. * Try to use new information immediately. For example, if you meet someone who says ""Hi! I'm Carlos,"" don't just say ""Hello."" Repeat the person's name. Say"" _ "" * Break a big number into smaller parts. For example, it's hard to memorize 109244153. But if you break it into three parts--109/244/153--it becomes easier. *Write out what you need to remember over and over again. This will help you keep it in mind longer, especially for memorizing formulas or facts. *Always review information. If you bring what you've learned back to your mind, they become easier to remember. For example, before you go to sleep, it's a good idea to review the new things you learned that clay. * Discuss with a friend. It is always easier to remember things through discussions. You can have a discussion about what's right and what's wrong, and it will lead to the right answer. *Never tell yourself that you have a bad memory. You can always do something to help improve your memory. And everyone's memory gets better if they use it often enough. All of the suggestions are helpful. If you follow them, you are certain to improve your memory."	['To break it into stunner parts.']
Which of the following sentences is NOT true according to this passage?	"Steven Jobs, the designer of Apple Computer, was not clever when he was in school. At that time, he was not a good student and he always made troubles with his schoolmates. When he went into college, he didn't change a lot. Then he dropped out . But he was full of new ideas. After he left college, Steven Jobs worked as a video game designer. He worked there for only several months and then he went to India. He hoped that the trip would give him some new ideas and give him a change in his life. Steven Jobs lived on a farm in California for a year after he returned from India. In 1975, he began to make a new type of computer. He designed the Apple Computer with his friend in his garage. He chose the name ""Apple"" just because it could help him to remember a happy summer he once spent in an apple tree garden. His Apple Computer was so successful that Steven Jobs soon became famous all over the world. He often said, ""I live in order to change the world, there aren't any other reasons. The only way to have a great achievement is to love your own career. If you can't find your favorite career, go on looking for it and never give up.""

There are no advertisements on_.	"One of the first things that Jim discovered while living with the Greens was that there were different television channels in Britain, the BBC broadcasts on two channels: BBC1 and BBC2. There is a mixture of serious and light programmes on BBC1; there are mainly serious programmes on BBC2. ITV is an independent channel which carries advertisements . There are no advertisements on the BBC, so everyone must pay some money to the BBC each year. There are both serious and light programmes on ITV. Because of the different channels, it is not surprising that you often see each member in Mg. Green's house wants to choose his or her own favorite channel. This is the sort of thing you hear: ""There's sports programme on ITV."" ""What's that, children?"" ""We were wondering if we could watch the sports programme on ITV.""

Boy zone was formed by _ members in 1993.	"The Luck of the Irish Look at a map of Britain, and the island on the left is Ireland. It's a small but beautiful country with a long tradition of folk music. Up until 10 years ago just about the only thing that Ireland was famous for was its specialty black beer. Now Ireland is famous around the world for its music with names like ""Kenya"",""U2"" ,""Van Morrison""and more recently ""the Corers"". ""Boyzone"",one of the world's top boy bands ,is from Ireland too.What's more,Boyzone member shane has twin sisters,Adele and Heavy,who are members of ""B Witched"" The ""Boyzone""story is interesting because they were created in 1993 by Dublin nightclub owner John Reynolds.They advertised in newspapers to find members for the group and 300wannabe pop stars applied! Ronan,who was just 17 when he dropped out of school to make his bid for stardom,and shane,who had been working as trained mechanic in his father's garage when he left to join Boyzone,were both lucky enough to be chosen. The other members are shoe-shop attendant stephen lately,former mechanic Mike Graham and one-time clothes store assistant Keith Dully. Many people expect bands that have been created by the music industry to produce boring music which doesn't become popular. Even the boys themselves knew they the would not easily achieve international pop music success. Boyzone quickly proved that they were more than just pretty faces and have sold millions of records around the world.At the moment ,they are not big stars in America,but they say that will change,when they begin a tour of the United States.

From the survey, we know that _ .	They spend more than ten hours a day cooking, cleaning the house, getting children ready for school and helping with homework. Cooking takes up about one hour and nine minutes a day. Doing the laundry takes about 61 minutes. Mothers also spend about 55 minutes getting children ready for school, about 53 minutes putting them to bed and about 47 minutes helping with homework. However, 30% of those mothers with children under 16 get less than six hours' sleep at night. 83% are not happy because they have less than an hour of their own time every day. Only 17% are happy with this kind of life.	['most mothers want to have more time to do their own things']
Though Tom got raised to a better position by his boss, he had no power, we can say _	From birth to death, the word kick has been given an important part in expressing human experience. The proud and happy mother feels the first signs of life kicking inside her body. And that same life------many years later------ comes to its end in a widely-used expression, to kick the bucket( ) . The expression to kick the bucket is almost 200 years old. One belief is that it started when an English stableman killed himself by hanging while standing on a bucket. He put a rope around his neck and tied it to a beam in the ceiling, and then kicked the bucket away from under him. Another old expression that comes from England is to kick over the traces. Traces were the chains that held at horse or mule to a wagon or plow. Sometimes, an animal refused to obey and kicked over the traces. Kick around is an expression that is heard often in American English. A person who is kicked around is someone who is treated badly. Usually he is not really being kicked by somebody's foot. He is just not being treated with the respect that all of us want. A person who has kicked around for most of his life is someone who has spent his life moving from place to place. In this case, kicking around means moving often from one place to another. Kick around has another meaning when you use it with the word idea. When you kick around an idea, you are giving that idea some thought. There is no physical action when you kick a person upstairs, although the pain can be as strong .You kick a person upstairs by removing him from an important job and giving him a job that sounds more important, but really is not. Still another meaning of the word kick is to free oneself of a bad habit, such as smoking cigarettes. Health campaigns urge smokers to kick the habit.	['the boss kicked Tom upstairs']
Where does Else most like to watch her father ride Fiery?	"""Tell me again how you learned to ride a horse,"" I would ask my father when I was a little girl in Denmark. I was no more than four years old--too little to learn to ride a horse by myself. But I liked to hear my father tell his story. And then he would begin. ""When I was a little boy, as little as you are now,"" he would say, ""I wanted to ride the horses. But I was too small to mount a horse. So I would slip into my father's stables to be with the horses and admire them. Such big, powerful animals they were! ""The gentle workhorses stood quietly in their stalls, eating their hay. I would climb up the side of one of the stalls and slide over onto the horse's back. ""Then I would hold its mane and imagine us running quickly over the grasslands, down to the shore, and even into the sea. ""When I grew tall enough to mount a horse,"" he said, ""my wish came true."" ""You swim with the horses now,"" I said. ""You even swim with Fiery. And he has spirit!"" Everybody knew about Fiery, the great black male horse with the fierce temper, and how he behaved when he first came to the stables. He raised itself on its back legs with the front legs in the air. He snorted and kicked. He rolled his eyes. And everyone was afraid of him. Everyone, except my father. I wanted to hear more. ""Now tell me how you made Fiery your friend,"" I begged. This was my favorite story. ""Well, little Else,"" my father went on, ""I just talked to him. I talked as a friend. You must talk to a horse like Fiery. ""I'd say, 'No, little horse. No, my friend. You can't run free. You must learn to let me ride you.' ""And soon Fiery began to listen. He knew from my voice that I would be his friend."" So Fiery let my father teach him to carry a rider. Then Fiery would take my father across the soft green grasslands or even into the lively waters of the northern sea. I loved to see Father riding Fiery without a saddle into the sea. There they swam, Father and Fiery, out in the cold, clear water. Often I would watch them from the shore, holding tight to my mother's hand. They swam so bravely. I was so proud of them! Then Father and Fiery would come splashing out of the water and run along the shore toward us. They made a fine stop--just in time! Fiery towered over us. He tossed his head and shook sea water from his shining black coat. Father was laughing and patting Fiery's neck. And I was making a wish. I wished that someday I could have a horse, too . . . but a smaller one!"	['At the seashore.']
The study showed that _	"""Children need more geography field trips. Schools should organize geography field trips to stop pupils from sitting before computer screens for a long time. And children should be encouraged to see the natural world and study geography,"" says Michael Palin. The famous actor and writer, Michael Palin, made the comments days after a study showed that pupils in the UK were less likely to take part in science field trips than in most other developed countries. The study found that 13% of schools in the UK failed to take children out of the classroom regularly. Mr. Palin said that field trips were an important part of geography and that he was interested in geography because he had a good geography teacher and he had many opportunities to ""get out of the school building"". In an interview, Mr. Palin said, ""It was important for children to see things for themselves and learn about the rest of the world. You have to show them a mountain, show them a factory, show them a power station."" Mr. Palin had been to the North and South Poles, the Himalayas , the Sahara and Eastern Europe. ""Geography is about the study of the earth. It is a _ subject,"" he said. ""It's related to everything we do: what we eat, what transport we take to work, where we live, what houses are made of, and so on."" He said children needed to get basic geography knowledge first and that once they had the basic knowledge they could move on to deeper problems, such as population and pollution. ""Today's children will need to deal with a lot of problems when they grow up. They have to learn geography today,"" he said."	['students who studied geography seldom went out of the school building']
Which of the following best shows that Buck was an excellent leader?	"""Well, what did I say?Buck's a real fighter, all right,"" said Francois the next morning when he discovered that Spitz had disappeared and that Buck was covered in blood. ""Spitz fought like a wolf,"" said Perrault, as he looked at the bites all over Buck. ""And Buck fought like ten wolves,"" answered Francois. ""And we'll travel faster now. No more Spitz,no more trouble."" Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place. ""Look at Buck!"" said Francois,laughing. ""He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!"" He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry. ""I'll show you! "" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge. Buck remembered _ ,and moved away. This time,when Solleks was harnessed as lead-dog,Buck did not try to move in.He kept a few meters away and circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave, Buck refused.He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead-dog. For an hour the two men tried to harness him.Buck did not run away,but he did not let them catch him.Finally,Francois sat down,and Perrault looked at his watch.It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled. Francois walked up to Solleks,took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front. But Buck did not move. ""Put down the club,"" said Perrault. Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team.Francois harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving. Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no difference to Dave and Solleks; they continued to pull hard.But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading.They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes. Pike,the second dog,was usually lazy;but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe,another difficult dog,and after that there were no more problems with him.The team started to pull together,and to move faster and faster. ""I've never seen a dog like Buck!"" cried Francois, ""Never! He's worth a thousand dollars. What do you think, Perrault? "" Perrault agreed.They were moving quickly,and covering more ground every day. The snow was good and hard,and no new snow fell.The temperature dropped to 45degC below zero, and didn't change. This time there was more ice on the Thirty Mile River, and they crossed in a day.Some days they ran a hundred kilometers,or even more. They reached Skagway in fourteen days; the fastest time ever."

Why did the author and his classmates react with blank stares ?	"When I was a high school student , mathematics looked like a big hurdle for me and several of my classmates.When we reached the ninth class, we got Mr. Iyer, a strict maths teacher who was also our class teacher.He always stuck to his discipline.We had to arrive on time, pay undivided attention to his lectures, and dared not neglect any of h is homework. Even so, as our class teacher, we got to know him better.Noticing some of us fidgeting one day as the mid -term exams approached, he stopped solving a mathematical problem to ask us why."" There' s too much to do,"" we sighed.""We're afraid we'll never manage to finish our revision before the exams."" ""Nothing is impossible,"" Mr. Iyer told us. ""This classroom is on the second floor. Do you have a problem reaching here ?"" We reacted with blank stares. ""No, you don' t !""he said , answering his own question.""You have a staircase to help you climb up to this level.No one expects you to make it in two giant leaps.You simply take one step at a time.Any task can be solved if you focus on the immediate action to be taken.The rest w ill take care of itself, if you keep at it.One step at a time.That' s the secret."" Then he wrote down an o ld motto on the blackboard --the longest journey starts with a single step.Having heard his staircase analogy , w e understood why he asked us the question and we saw him in a new light. Most of my classmates scored distinctions in maths.And I went on to become an English teacher.To this day , whenever I pass on Mr.Iyer's invaluable advice to my own students , they brighten up at the prospect of a lighter academic burden."

What does h. a. b. e's stand for?	"Successful people have developed habits leading to success. Those are the people you want to study and follow. Do what they do. Read what they read. If they are local, see if you can take them to lunch and ask questions. If not, get a hold of some of the things they have written about or listen to them. Most successful people enjoy the opportunity to coach people along and to help them become successful. It is their way of giving back. The trouble is that most people won't ask. They come up with excuses. They say to themselves, "" I am not important enough for this person to talk to me."" The successful people understand that life is a learning experience and it doesn't stop in school. They always strive( ,) to reach the next level. Life will always give you the results of your actions. Ask yourself what actions are you taking? What are you creating? You create what you think about. Willie Hooks calls it our h. a. b. e.'s. Our habits, attitudes, beliefs and expectations. Before starting any new habit we have to know what we want. So how do we permanently change our habits? Start your action plan. Put your plan together. What do I need to do first? Set my goals. Then next I would put a diet plan together. Then I would start an exercise program. You get the idea. Put a good solid plan together. So there it is in a nutshell. We have the power to change any bad habit that we don't like. Will it be easy? Probably not, but it might not be as hard as we think either. The hard part is to get started. Remember that these habit have been a part of us for a long time so don't expect miracles at first. Use the process described above and you cam overcome and change any habit that you want to change."	['Habits, attitudes, beliefs and expectations.']

Which of the following statements is true about the passage?	The shocking collapse of one of the West Coast's biggest wild salmon runs has prompted even cash-trapped fishermen to call for an unprecedented shutdown of salmon fishing off the coasts of California and Oregon. The Sacramento River salmon run is usually one of the most productive on the Pacific Coast,providing the bulk of the salmon caught by sport and commercial trollers off California and Oregon. But only about 90,000 adult salmon returned to the Central Valley last fall--the second lowest number on record and well below the number needed to maintain a healthy fishery.That number is projected to fall to a record low of58.000 this year. The council,which regulates Pacific Coast fisheries,will choose between three management options:a total ban on salmon fishing off the coast of California and Oregon;extremely limited fishing in select areas;or catch-and-release fishing for scientific research. For consumers,it will be hard to find any Chinook,also known as king salmon.which are prized by trollers,seafood critics and upscale restaurants.There should still be abundant supplies of farm-raised salmon.but prices could be higher. Biologists and others are trying to figure out what caused the salmon collapse so they can make sure California's Chinook populations rebound. There are many potential factors,because wild salmon are born in streams and rivers, migrate to the ocean when they're juveniles and spend two to four years there before returning to spawn in the areas where they were born.In between they have to navigate the often dangerous waters of the Sacramento Delta and San Francisco Bay. The council has asked state and federal scientists to research possible causes, including water diversions,habitat destruction,dam operations,agricultural pollution,and ocean conditions.Many scientists point out that unusual weather patterns disrupted the marine food chain along the Pacific Coast in 2005,when thousands of seabirds washed up dead or starving because they couldn't find enough to eat. Researchers believe those poor ocean conditions also devastated the juvenile salmon that would have returned to the Central Valley last year.Young Chinook couldn't find the tiny shrimp and fish they depend onto survive.	['Last fall,there was the second lowest number of grown salmon returning on record.']

Due to road safety issues _ .	"Let Children Roam Free Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep. But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the ""culture of fear"": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history. These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them. Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents. Around 100 child pedestrians are killed every year, a figure that puts the UK near the bottom of Europe's child road safety league. It is no surprise that figures show a steady fall in children walking or cycling over the last twenty years, to the extent that while over 90% of children own a bicycle, just 2% cycle to school. Also, 30% of children aged eight to ten never play outside without an adult watching over them. In a single generation, the ""home habitat"" of a typical eight-year-old----the area in which children are able to travel on their own- has shrunk to one-ninth of its former size. Health experts have even created a new word, ""obesogenic"", to describe those aspects of our lives that make us fat, and top of the list is the design of streets, towns and cities."

Many people are interested in _ online.	Nowadays, shopping online becomes a new way of shopping. It is getting more and more popular. Many people like doing some shopping through Internet. Why is shopping online becoming more and more popular? First, it provides lots of advantages . There are many goods on the Internet. People can find anything they want. The price on the Internet is usually cheaper than that in the store. People can save some money.Second, more and more people have their own computers and they join their computers with the Internet. So it is possible for many of them to do shopping through the Internet. People don't need to go to the shop themselves. They can save a lot of time. But, a coin has two sides. Customers can only see the pictures of the goods on the Internet. And they can't enjoy the pleasure of buying things in a large supermarket or a wonderful shopping center. Maybe shopping online makes people boring. So some people don't like this new wayof shopping. They are worried about the safety of shopping online.	['shopping']
Which of the following is NOT TRUE if you want to get out of the habit of sleeping during the evening?	I don't think there is anything wrong with your blood. The key to your problem is that long nap after dinner. If you didn't sleep for hours during the early part of the evening, you would be more ready to sleep at bedtime. If you didn't nap after dinner, you would not want to stay up so late, and you would not feel the need to take a sleeping pill. The pill is still working in your system when you get up in the morning. This helps account for the fact that you feel tired all day. You should get out of the habit of sleeping during the early evening. Right after your evening meal, engage in some sort of physical activity-a sport such as bowling, perhaps. Or get together with friends for an evening of cards and conversation. Then go to bed at your usual time or a little earlier, and you should be able to get a good night's rest without taking a pill. If you can get into the habit of spending your evenings this way, I am sure you will feel less tired during the day. At first it may be hard for you to go to sleep without taking a pill. If so, get up and watch television or do some jobs around your house until you feel sleepy. If you fall asleep and then wake up a few hours later, get up but do not take a sleeping pill. Read a while or listen to the radio, and make yourself a few hours' sleep that night, you will feel better in the morning than you usually feel after taking a pill. The next night you will be ready to sleep at an earlier hour. The most important thing is to avoid taking that nap right after dinner and avoid taking pills.	['Do some physical labor.']
When a wild goose becomes sick or is wounded, _ .	Next autumn when you see wild geese heading south for the winter flying in a V formation you might think about what scientists have discovered as to why they fly that way. As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the bird immediately following. By flying in a V formation the whole group adds at least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flies on its own. People who share a common direction and sense of community can get where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on the push of one another. When a wild goose falls out of the formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go alone and quickly tries to get back into the formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front. When the head goose gets tired, it flies back into the formation and another goose flies to the front. It is wise to take turns doing difficult jobs whether it be people or wild geese flying south. Wild geese honk from behind to inspire those up front to keep up their speed. What can we learn from this? When a wild goose gets sick or wounded by gunshots, and falls out of the formation, two other geese will fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection. They will stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly or until it dies, and only then will they go on with their own or with another formation to catch up with their group.	['two other geese will stay with it to offer help']
What effect does reading have on the author?	I grew up in a house where the TV was seldom turned on and with one wall in my bedroom entirely lined with bookshelves, most of my childhood was spent on books I could get hold of. In fact, I grew up thinking of reading as natural as breathing and books unbelievably powerful in shaping perspectives by creating worlds we could step into, take part in and live in. With this unshakable belief, I, at fourteen, decided to become a writer. Here too, reading became useful. Every writer starts off knowing that he has something to say, but being unable to find the right ways to say it. He has to find his own _ by reading widely and discovering which parts of the writers he agrees or disagrees with, or agrees with so strongly that it reshapes his own world. He cannot write without loving to read, because only through reading other people's writing can one discover what works, what doesn't and, in the end, together with lots of practice, what voice he has. Now I am in college, and have come to realize how important it is to read fiction. As a law student, my reading is in fact limited to subject matter -- the volume of what I have to read for classes every week means there is little time to read anything else. Such reading made it all the clearer to me that I live in a very small part in this great place called life. Reading fiction reminds me that there is life beyond my own. It allows me to travel across the high seas and along the Silk Road, all from the comfort of my own armchair, to experience, though secondhand, exciting experiences that I wouldn't necessarily be able to have in my lifetime.

Which of the following can be inferred according to the passage?	"It's a too long story -- 17 months to be exact -- with an ending that's short and sweet. Ruthie has, finally and happily, been reunited with her family. The story goes back to October, 2005. Ruthie, 8 months old, was sitting on the back seat of the family car when her owner walked hurriedly into a Long Island store. When Nancy Noel returned a few minutes later, Ruthie was nowhere in sight. Nancy Noel and her husband, Lincoln Werden, got in touch with Nassau County police, put up flyers around their Manhasset neighborhood. But no sightings of Ruthie were reported. Until last week, that is, someone sent Ruthie to a Manhattan shelter after finding her walking slowly around the Bronx -- 25 miles from where she was taken on that fateful October day. And then, shelter workers searched Ruthie for a possible microchip -- she had one fixed under her skin. It showed her family's name and address. Ruthie was immediately reunited with Nancy Noel and her daughter, Sara Werden. ""We never thought we would see her again,"" said Sara Werden. ""We were just amazed."" She's no longer the tiny pup they last saw. In fact, Ruthie gained 10 pounds during her months away from home. She's on a diet now, and has already lost one and a half pounds. Ruthie also has a new friend to play with. The family had got another dog, named Holly, after losing the hope of ever finding their beloved Ruthie."

According to the passage, the reason why many people have to work hard nowadays is that they want to _ .	Nowadays many people have to work very hard in order to live a better life. And the hard they work, the less they pay attention to their health. But it's very important for us to keep healthy in our everyday life. Here are some ways for you to follow. First, you should have a healthy diet. It's necessary to eat enough fish and vegetables, as they contain many kinds of vitamin you need every day. Do not eat too much fat, such as butter or anything too fatty. Too many sweets can do harm to your teeth, so you'd better not eat too many sweets or chocolates and keep off coffee. Second, good habits can help you keep fit. Doing regular exercise is certainly a good way to ensure that your body is healthy. After a day's work, an eight-hour sleep is needed. And avoid working or studying too hard.	['live a better life']
Which of the following is the best tile for this passage?	What do those countries have in common? People are killing each other or drive others out of their homes. Why is this happening? Very simple, in each of these, one group of people believes another group is different from them and dangerous to them. It has been thus through history. How different are humans from each other? We come in different colors: red, black, white, yellow and brown; we have a variety of political systems, social systems, religious views or none at all; We are different in mind, have different educational systems, different economic classes. We speak different languages, and have different customs and dresses. If we were to break each of these further, we would have quite a long list of qualities and characteristics that make humans appears to be different from each other. I say they appear to be different, because most of what have been listed stand for what we see or hear, not what is true of human. Man is man everywhere. It is only where he lives, when he lives there, with whom he lives there, and al the others that have effect on how he lives, that is, what he believes, what he wears, his customs, his language and so on. These are man-made facts that each group develops over tome, living together, facing the same problems, needing and desiring the same things. They are his culture. The truth is that we are much more same than different. If you wear one type of clothing and I wear another, we both wear some kind of clothing. Our culture demands it. If you speak one language and I another, we both speak so that others will understand us; we must communicate with each other. Nothing is gained by giving too many differences, but much is lost. If we understood our differences as the ones of culture, then we could make our world more peaceful. Differences does not mean better or worse, right or wrong. It means only that differences have been made by society. Differences produce variety of thoughts, work out human problems peacefully.	['Differences.']
The letter was written to _ .	Dear Mr. Plant, I am an enthusiastic camper and longtime X-Ports customer, but after being offended for the third time at your Sierra Vista location, I am writing to complain about your impolite employees. Several months ago ,I bought a tent that leaked the first time I used it and wanted it replaced . When I took it back, your employees accused me of tearing it myself. I left not only withm1, torn tent, but no refund and no satisfaction. A couple of weeks ago , I bought a sleeping bag that was supposed to sleep two people comfort-ably. It didn't. Your employees refused to give me my money back even though I had the receipt. I was asked to leave the store, again with no satisfaction. To my misfortune, my latest purchase , of a piece of camping equipment at your store proyed to be another disappointment. The propane camp stove I bought didn't work properly. When I returned to exchange it, the rude clerk refused to help me because I did not have my sales receipt. It was an even exchange! He said that I was a problem and even asked if I had seen what products I-could purchase at one of your competitor's stores at comparable prices. Was he accusing me of something? Why would I have brought a receipt for an even exchange? Why would I know the price at other stores? Furthermore, the clerk called security and forced me to leave your store-without my camp stove! How can I go camping now? The tent leaks, the sleeping bag is just wrong, and I don't have a stove to keep warm ! Who is going to refund my money for my stove? Who is going to help me get over the abuse I suffered in your store? You, as the area manager must clear these matters up for me immediately! I am sending copies of this letter to your main office and the Sierra Vista Store. Sincerely , Ima Kumpanee	['complain about poor service']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	With the release of the Annual Report on the Development of Chinese Returnees, concerns regarding the cost of studying abroad and the future benefits are rising among both students and parents. According to the report, it takes most overseas returnees at least five years to earn back their study abroad costs. Whether it is worth the investment made to obtain a foreign degree has always been an issue concerning the growing trend of studying abroad in recent years. In order to find out if studying abroad is still a worthwhile investment, 21st Century talked to experts in related fields. More students are returning after studying abroad Despite the heated debates about the value of overseas study, there has been a steady increase in the number of students going abroad. According to the Chinese Ministry of Education, the number of Chinese students who studied abroad increased by 17. 7 percent from 2011 to 2012. A total of 399 , 600 Chinese students went to study abroad last year. The US is certainly benefiting from Chinese students' ambition to study abroad: according to the US-based Institute of International Education's Open Doors 2013 report, which provides detailed data on student flows into and out of the US, during the 2012/13 academic year, Chinese student enrollments( ,) increased by 21. 4 percent to more than 235,000. Similarly, the number of overseas returnees is surging, especially since 2008 when developed countries were greatly affected by the economic crisis. In 2009, the number of returnees, for the first time, broke through 100,000 and this has increased at an annual rate of about 50 percent ever since. Various reasons contribute to this growing trend, with family issues believed to be the primary one. According to Wang Huiyao, the report's author, most students are only children and tend to depend on their parents. Besides, the economic situation in China has boosted returnees' confidence in a future career at home. Surging cost Accompanying the increase in the number of students leaving and returning to China is the increase in the study abroad costs. According to the Open Doors 2013 report, international students pay an average of 135,000 yuan per year to attend a public university in the US, a 3. 1 percent increase on the previous year.

From where does the name come?	There is an interesting festival in China. On that special day, people in Hunan province always have a dragon boat match. The dragon boat is quite long, like a dragon. There are pictures of dragons on each side. The front of the boat is like the head of a dragon. During the match, about twenty men in the boat make it move as fast as it can. Among them stands another man. He beats a drum to make the others boat in the same rhythm . It's an exciting match, especially when they are reaching the end. The audience along the lake shout for their favourite team. From this match, we have the name of the festival--the Dragon Boat Festival. This special day has another name---Duanwu Festival. In it we have a story. Long, long ago, there was a famous poet called Qu Yuan. He was famous not only for his poems, but also for thinking a lot for the people. After he died, people eat rice dumplings in memory of him on this special day.	['the dragon boat match in Hunan province']
One of the benefits of being a rancher is that he can _ .	"What's the coolest job ever? It may be one that allows you to express your personality while doing something you love and getting paid for it. Here are some really cool jobs. *Cowboy If you dream of living the rural life as a cowboy, consider a position as a rancher or a farm manager. You can expect to earn between US$25,000 and US$35,000 a year, says Brady Lynch, an agricultural research consultant. ""A lot of benefits will include other things like housing, a vehicle and even beef or chicken,"" he adds. *Professional Golfer You need nerves of steel to face pressure and difficulty and a love of travel to survive as a professional golfer. Average yearly winnings in the Ladies Professional Golf Association were US$230,117 in 2013. With 161 ladies on the list, top-ranked Na Yeon Choi earned more than US$1.8 million, while 161st-ranked Jackie Gallagher-Smith earned just US$1,786. If you want to stay in one place, work as a golf professional and earn an average salary of US$57,141, according to Monster's Salary Wizard. *Firefighter There's a lot of work out there in firefighting, but the competition is fierce, so you'll need mechanical aptitude , physical fitness and a bit of firefighting or emergency responder education to win a paid position. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts that next decade the industry will grow 9 percent to 336,900 jobs. The average salary for firefighters is US$45,420 a year. If you become chief, you could double that salary. *Flight Attendant Free flights are the best benefit offered to flight attendants. Attendants' salaries start at around US$16,191 a year, according to the Association of Flight Attendants. But the salary goes up as you stay on the job, and the average salary for US flight attendants is US$37,740, according to the BLS. Some airlines have minimum and maximum height requirements, and you can't be too large to walk down the aisle facing forward. Being able to speak a second language will make you more appealing to international airlines."	['live a life in a rural area as a cowboy']
You can _ if you want to bring a gift to your friend according to the passage.	An American friend has invited you to visit his family. You've never been to an American's home before, and you're not sure what to do. Should you take a gift? How should you dress? What time should you arrive? What should you do when you get there? Glad you asked. When you're the guest, you should just make yourself at home. That's what hospitality is all about: making people feel at home when they're not. The question of whether or not to bring a gift often makes guests squirm . Giving your host a gift is not just a social _ in some cultures-it's expected. But in American culture, a guest is not necessary to bring a present. Of course, some people do bring a small present to their host to show their thanks. The right gifts for the host might be flowers, candy, and you can bring toys if the family has small children. _	['buy a bunch of fowlers']
The job of the energy-saving policemen is _ .	"You may have known several kinds of police --- traffic police, fire police and street police. But have you ever heard of energy-saving policeman? A group of 22 energy-saving policemen went to work last week in Beijing. They go around the city to see the use of energy in hotels, office buildings, shopping centers and other public places. One of their aims is to make sure that these places have set their air conditioning no cooler than 26degC. They also set up a special phone line so that people can tell them which buildings fail to follow the rule. ""If everyone sets their air conditioning at 26degC, Beijing will save 400 million kilowatthour of electricity in one summer. That's one-third of all the usages of the city in the season,"" said a TV advertisement. Other Chinese cities, like Wuhan in Hubei Province and Yangzhou in Jiansu Province, are going to follow Beijing's steps in setting up a similar police team. As one of the fastest developing countries, China is using a lot of energy. This has a great effect on the country's environment and limited energy. From 1986 to 2005, the country experienced 20 warm winters continuously . Numbers show that Chinese cities have to spend billions of yuan solving environmental problems every year. At the beginning of this month, China made its first action plan to fight pollution. It aims to reduce energy usage by 20% and increase renewable energy up to 10% from 7% by 2010. To introduce the public to a green life, last week Beijing held a show on energy-saving technology and productions. Environment-friendly machines, such as a vending machine that helps collect used bottles, have attracted lots of attention. ""We want to tell people that there are certain ways to protect the environment. Each of us can find effective ways to do it on our daily lives,"" said Liu Qianguang, an environmental engineer in Beijing."	['to check the use of energy in public places']

It took the scientist _ to find out that monarch butterflies came from Canada.	Monarch butterflies from eastern Canada make the most amazing journey in the insect world. Each year, this butterfly travels about 3000miles to its winter home in central Mexico . How can it fly so far? And why does it make this long and dangerous trip? Scientists still don't have an answer. For many years, people in Mexico wondered where the orange-and-black butterflies came from every winter. Then, in 1937, a scientist started to follow and study the butterflies. For the next 20 years, he discovered that one butterfly started its journey in Canada. Four months later, it arrived in Mexico. The length of the butterflies find their way back to the same place? Another amazing thing is that the butterflies always return to the same area in central Mexico. How do the butterflies find their way back to the same place? This is an interesting question because only every fourth generation makes the trip south. In other words, the butterfly that travels to Mexico this year is the great-great-grandchild of the butterfly that traveled there last year. Each year, four generations of a Monarch butterfly family are born. Each generation of the family has a very different life. The first generation is born in the south in late April. It slowly moves north, reproduces , and then dies. On the trip north,two more generations are born, reproduce, and die. Each of these generations of butterflies is born. This generation has a much longer life. It lives for about eight months. This generation of butterflies makes the amazing journey back to the winter home of its great-great-grandparents. The butterflies spend the winter there, and in the spring they reproduce and then die. Their offspring will be the first generation of the next circle of life. Today, people are still studying the Monarch butterfly. But they are not clear about everything.	['20 years']

After he had gone to his room, the owner said to his wife, ""Look at his bag, dear. I'm sure there are lots of valuable things in it. I want to steal it when he is asleep."" ""No, no,"" said the woman. ""He must look for his bag tomorrow morning. Then he'll take you before the judge."" They thought and at last the woman had an idea. ""We have forgetful grass,"" said the woman, ""Why not put some into his food? If he has the food, he will forget to take his bag away."" ""How clever you are!"" said the owner, ""Don't forget it when you prepare supper for him."" The old man had the food with the forgetful grass and went to bed. The next morning, when the owner got up, he found the door was open and the old man had left with his bag. He woke his wife up and said angrily, ""What a fool! Your forgetful grass isn't useful at all."" ""No, no,"" said the woman. ""I don't think so. He must forget something."" ""Oh, I've remembered!"" The owner cried out suddenly, ""He forgot..."""

The United Kingdom is mainly made up of _ .	"What's the difference between the British Isles, Britain, the United Kingdom and England? The British Isles is made up of two large islands: One is called Ireland and the other Britain. Britain, or Great Britain, is the larger of these two islands and it is divided into three parts: Scotland, Wales and England. The United Kingdom (UK) is short for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is made up of Scotland, Wales, and England (i.e. the whole of Britain), and also about one-sixth of Ireland, the Northern part. The rest of Ireland is self-governing . England is the largest, most populous , and generally speaking, the richest section. English people often use the words ""England"" and ""English"" when they mean ""Britain"" and ""British"". This sometimes makes the Scots and the Welsh angry. The Scots are very proud of their separate nationality. The Welsh too do not consider themselves as England, and have a culture and even a language of their own. Ireland became part of the United Kingdom in 1801, but is soon grew discontented , and for forty years the ""Irish Question"" was the greatest headache of British Parliament . At last, Ireland divided itself into two: Northern Ireland remained loyal to the Crown , and in 1922 the rest of the country broke away to form Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland."

What was the boy doing on the street?	"A small boy sat on the street with a hat by his feet. He held up a sign which said: "" I am blind, please help"". There were only a few coins in the hat. A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked :""Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?"" The man said: ""I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way."" What he had written was: ""Today is a beautiful day but I cannot see it."" Do you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing? Of course both signs told people the boy was blind. But the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat. The second sign told people that they were able to enjoy the day, but the boy could not enjoy it because he was blind. The first sign simply said the boy was blind. The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. There are at least two lessons we can learn from this simple story. The first is: Be thankful for what you have. Someone else has less. Help where you can. The second is:Be creative. Think differently. There is always a better way!"	['He was begging for money.']

Which is the best possible title of the passage?	"They wear the latest fashions with the most up-to-date accessories . Yet these are not girls in their teens or twenties but women in their sixties and seventies. A generation which would once only wear old-fashioned clothes is now favoring the same high street looks worn by those half their age. Professor Julia Twigg, a social policy expert, said, ""Women over 75 are now shopping for clothes more frequently than they did when they were young in the 1960s. In the 1960s buying a coat for a woman was a serious matter. It was an expensive item that they would purchase only every three or four years -- now you can pick one up at the supermarket whenever you wish to. Fashion is a lot cheaper and people get tired of things more quickly."" Professor Twigg analyzed family expending data and found that while the percentage of spending on clothes and shoes by women had stayed around the same -- about 5 or 6 percent of spending -- the amount of clothes bought had risen sharply. The professor said, ""Clothes are now 70 percent cheaper than they were in the 1960s because of the huge expansion of production in the Far East. In the 1960s Leeds was the heart of the British fashion industry and that was where most of the clothes came from, but now almost all of our clothes are sourced elsewhere. Everyone is buying more clothes but in general we are not spending more money on them."" Fashion designer Angela Barnard, who runs her own fashion business in London, said older women were much more affected by celebrity style than in previous years. She said, ""When people see stars such as Judi Dench and Helen Mirren looking attractive and fashionable in their sixties, they want to follow them. Older women are much more aware of celebrities. There's also the boom in TV programmes showing people how they can change their look, and many of my older customers do yoga to stay in shape well in their fifties. When I started my business a few years ago, my older customers tended to be very rich, but now they are what I would call ordinary women. My own mother is 61 and she wears the latest fashions in a way she would never have done ten years ago. """	['Age Is No Barrier for Fashion Fans.']
As far as we can tell from the passage, Agatha Christie _ .	"In 1977, a dead author of detective stories saved the life of a 19-month-old baby in a most unusual way. The author was Agatha Christie, one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world. In June 1977, a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar, near Saudi Arabia. Doctors were unable to find out the cause of her illness with confidence, so she was sent to Hammersmith Hospital in London. She was then only semi-conscious and on the ""Dangerously Ill"" list. A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, too, were confused by the very unusual symptoms . While they were discussing the baby's case, a nurse asked to speak to them. ""Excuse me,"" said Nurse Marsha Maitlan, ""but I think the baby is suffering from thallium poisoning."" ""What makes you think that?"" Dr. Brown asked. ""Thallium poisoning is extremely rare."" ""A few days ago, I was reading a novel called A Pale Horse by Agatha Christie,"" Nurse Maitlan explained. ""In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the symptoms are described. They're exactly the same as the baby's."" ""You're very thoughtful and you may be right,"" another doctor said. ""We'll carry out some tests and find out whether it's thallium or not."" Tests showed that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium, a rare metallic substance used in making special glass. Once they knew the cause of the illness, the doctors were able to give the baby the correct treatment. She soon recovered and was sent back to Qatar. Later it was reported that the poison might have come from an insecticide used in Qatar."	['had never met this baby']

According to the text, the author's work was _ .	"My husband and I had just opened up a pet sitting business earlier that year. Our customers had slowly risen from three to thirty a month. We were busy through those hot summer months, driving between visits. Our work was strictly done at the pet owner's home. It was almost too busy for the two of us, but we were making good money! We asked pet owners new to our business to phone two weeks ahead so we had enough time to meet the owners and pets at their homes and make any following meetings before the owner leaves. One day, we decided to take on a new customer just two days before they would leave. We met the family, filled in a form, and spent some time with their dog, Hercules. He playfully jumped on us and touched our hands and arms using his tongue. The family laughed as he did this, showing us that he was very loving. Two days later I appeared at the house, alone. I came up to Hercules and said hello happily. I filled up his water bowl and cleaned any messes he made. Meanwhile, he was so lovely sitting beside. I thought this would be the good picture to send to the owners as usual. After the light and ""click"" sound went off, Hercules rushed at me. I didn't know what had just happened until I noticed the drops of blood. I ran out and did the only thing--calling my husband. Then I went to neighbors for help. My husband arrived after ten minutes. The helpful neighbor and my husband led Hercules back into his pen . Then my husband and I took off to the hospital. I must have looked like I was shot when I walked into the hospital. The nurses quickly moved me to a room. I asked the doctor in a weak but playful manner, ""Am I going to die?"" He replied, ""Finally."""	['well paid']
Who is this passage intended for?	Living a healthy lifestyle lies in forming the right eating habits. Here are some of the good habits you can develop when it comes to healthy eating. Drink plenty of water. You must drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. You may need even more water if you are in a hot environment or if you are exercising. Eat breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. A recent study has shown that those who eat breakfast will consume an average of 100 calories less during the day than their colleagues who skipped breakfast. They will also be able to concentrate better. Don't skip lunch. If you do so, your blood sugar level will drop and your metabolism will slow down. When you get home you are starving and eat everything you can find. We all need to snack from time to time, but please choose your snacks carefully. In fact, it's a good idea to eat two healthy snacks besides your three main meals. Choose healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables, low fat yogurt, cottage cheese with apple sauce, and so on. Eat your fruit and vegetables. We should eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Take a piece of fruit for a snack, add some banana and _ to your favourite breakfast cereal, have a salad with lunch, and eat at least one vegetable at dinner each night. Do not eat your dinner too late. Try to eat dinner at least 3 hours before you go to bed. This will give your body a chance to digest most of the food before you rest for the next 8 hours. Plan dinner for the week ahead of time and make sure you have everything you need in the house so other family members can get a head start on dinner if you have a late meeting at the office.

One day he was sitting at the bar in his restaurant when a big gorilla walked in and asked for a table. Henry showed no surprise. He took the gorilla to a table and handed him a menu. He treated him politely and pretended there was nothing at all strange about having a gorilla in his restaurant. The gorilla looked through the menu and ordered a salad. Henry served the gorilla his salad personally, knowing that his waiters and waitresses would be too frightened. At last the gorilla finished his salad and asked for the bill. Henry wrote out the bill and handed it to the big animal. The gorilla studied it, shook his head sadly, then gave Henry fifty dollars.

What was it that made the author upset?	"One summer I was driving from my hometown of Tahoe City,Calif.,to New Orleans.In the middle of the desert, I came upon a young man standing by the roadside. He had his thumb out and held a gas can in his other hand. I drove right by him.There was a time in the country when you'd be considered a jerk if you passed by somebody in need. Now you are a fool for helping. With gangs, drug addicts, murderers, rapists, thieves lurking everywhere, ""I don't want to get involved"" has become a national motto. Several states later I was still thinking about the hitchhiker.Leaving him stranded in the desert did not bother me so much.What bothered me was how easily I had reached the decision.I never even lifted my foot off the accelerator. Does anyone stop any more? I wondered.I recalled Blanche DuBois's famous line:""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers"". Could anyone rely on the kindness of strangers these days? One way to test this would be for a person to journey from coast to coast without any money, relying solely on the goodwill of his fellow Americans.What kind of Americans would he find? Who would feed him, shelter him,carry him down the road? The idea intrigued me. The week I turned 37,I realized that I had never taken a gamble in my life.So I decided to travel from the Pacific to the Atlantic without a penny.It would be a cashless journey through the land of the almighty dollar.I would only accept offers of rides, food and a place to rest my head.My final destination would be Cape Fear in North Carolina,a symbol of all the fears I'd have to conquer during the trip. I rose early on September 6, 1994, and headed for the Golden Gate Bridge with a 50pound pack on my back and a sign displaying my destination to passing vehicles:""America"". For six weeks I hitched 82 rides and covered 4,223 miles across 14 states.As I traveled, folks were always warning me about someplace else.In Montana they told me to watch out for the cowboys in Wyoming; in Nebraska they said people would not be as nice in Iowa. Yet I was treated with kindness everywhere I went.I was amazed by people's readiness to help a stranger, even when it seemed to run contrary to their own best interests."

After 12 months into the study, _ .	"Not all think laughter is the best medicine, but it seems to help.So scientists carried on a new study of diabetes patients who were given a good dose of humor for a year to prove it. Researchers divide 20 high-risk diabetic patients into two groups.Both groups were given standard diabetes medicine.Group L viewed 30 minutes of humor of their choice, while Group C, the control group, did not.This went on for a year of treatments. By two months into the study, the patients in the laughter group had lower level of the hormones epinephrine , considered to cause stress, which is known to be deadly.After the 12 months, _ rises 26 percent in Group L but only 3 percent in Group C.In another measure, C-reactive proteins, a maker of heart disease, drop 66 percent in the laughter group but only 26 percent in the control group. ""The best doctors believe that there is a physical good brought about by the positive emotion, happy laughter,"" said study leader Lee Berk of Loma Linda University.And other research has found that humor makes us more hopeful.Still, more study is needed, Berk said.The research by Berk found that humor can bring about similar changes in body chemistry, which was proved in the new study.The research result will be presented this month at the meeting in the US.Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine shows that laughter causes the inner lining of blood vessels to expand, increasing blood flow in a way thought to be healthy. ""Lifestyle choices have an important effect on health and these are choices which we and patients should pay attention to, rather than prevention and treatment,"" Berk said in a statement this week."

When God created things, _	"God created the mule and told him,""You will be Mule,working constantly from dusk dawn, Carrying heavy loads on your back.You will eat grass, and you lack intelligence.You will live for 40 years.""The mule answered,""To live like this for 40 years is too much.Please, give me no more than 20.""And it was so. Then God created the dog and told him, ""You will hold vigilance over the dwellings of Man.To him you will be his greatest companion.You will eat his table scraps and live for 25 years."" the dog responded,""Lord,to live 25 years as a dog is too much.Please, no more than 10 years.""And it was so. God then created the monkey and told him,""You are Monkey.You shall swing from tree to tree, acting like a fool. You will be funny,and you shall live for 20 years.""The monkey responded,""Lord,to live 20 years as the clown of the world is too much.Please,Lord,give me no more than 10 years.""And it was so. Finally,God created Man and told him,""You are Man,the only rational being that walks on the earth.You will use your intelligence to have mastery over the creatures of the world.You will dominate the earth and live for 20 years.""The man responded,""Lord,to be Man for only 20 years is too little.Please,Lord,give me the 20 years the mule refused,the 15 years the dog refused,and the ten years the monkey rejected.""And it was so.So God made Man live 20 years as a man, then marry and live 20 years like a mule,working and carrying heavy loads on his back.Then,Man is to have children and live 15 years as a dog,guarding his house and eating the leftovers after they empty the pantry .Then,in his old age,to live 10 years as a monkey,acting like a clown to amuse his grandchildren."

In which countries does most part of virtual water come from outside? _	"As the saying goes, man struggles upwards; water flows downwards. Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans. But downhill isn't the only way that water moves .A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption. This flow isn't the type we usually think about .These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports. They call this a flow of ""virtual water "". We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap. However,92%of the water used by people goes into growing crops,according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra. He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats .These products are shipped around the world. For example, consider a sugary soft drink. Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half-liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water--about 95%--is used to grow and process the ingredients .Another 4%goes into the packaging and labeling. In Hoekstra's calculation, when one country produces a half-liter of soda and sells it abroad,it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator. According to Hoekstra's new report,dry countries like Israel and Kuwait,both in the Middle East,get the majority of their virtual water from other countries,through imported products. More surprisingly, some wetter countries,like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, also get the majority of their virtual water from other places. That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries. In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources .In China even less of the water associated with its products."	['Kuwait and the Netherlands']

What was strange about the wedding in Bangladesh ?	Every culture in the world has marriage and wedding ceremonies . Usually marriages are between one woman(the bride) and one man ( the groom). However, in other parts of the world a man may have several wives, or, as in some areas of India, a wife may have more than one husband.. There are also many different kinds of wedding ceremonies practiced around the world. These ceremonies can be very short and simple, or very long and complicated. One of the largest and most expensive wedding ceremonies in recent times was held in Dubai in 1981. The couple tying the knot at this wedding were the son of Sheik ( a male Arab ruler) Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum and Princess Salama. The wedding ceremony took seven days and cost $44 million. It was held in a large building which was specially built for the ceremony and looked like a stadium. The bride and groom needed a large place for their wedding because more than 20,000 guests were invited. The reasons why a man and woman get married also vary. Sometimes they marry because they are in love, sometimes they marry because someone they meet through a matchmaker, and sometimes they marry because their parents tell them that they must marry. One unusual example of an arranged marrige took place in Bangladesh in 1986. The groom was an eleven-month-old boy and the bride was a three-month-old girl. They were the youngest married couple ever. The parents of the bride and groom arranged the marriage as a way of ending a fight between the two families who had been arguing over a farm for twenty years. Both families thought they owned the farm, but no one knew exactly . The fight ended for good when the young boy married the young girl. By arranging this marriage, neither famlily was forced to lose face. The two families agreed to give the farm to the young people.	['The bride and groom were young.']
Which of the following is NOT related to the potentially troubling sign?	"Dolphins and sharks are showing up in surprisingly shallow water just off the Florida coast. Mullets, crabs, rays and small fish gather by the thousands off an Alabama pirer. Birds covered in oil are crawling deep into marshes , never to be seen again. Marine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing some strange phenomena. Fish and other wildlife seem to be fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast in a trend that some researchers see as a potentially troubling sign. The animals' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted, and the crowding could result in mass die-offs as fish run out of oxygen. Also, the animals could easily be captured by their enemies. The nearly two-month-old spill has created an environmental disaster in US history as tens of millions of gallons have flown into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Scientists are seeing some unusual things as they try to understand the effects on thousands of species of marine life. For nearly four hours Monday, a three-person crew with Greenpeace cruised past delicate islands and mangrove-dotted inlets in Barataria Bay off southern Louisiana. They saw dolphins by the dozen frolicking in the oily sheen and oil-tinged pelicans feeding their young. But they spotted no dead animals. ""I think part of the reason why we're not seeing more yet is that the impacts of this crisis are really just beginning,"" Greenpeace marine biologist John Hocevar said. The counting of dead wildlife in the Gulf is more than an academic exercise; the deaths will help determine how much BP pays in damages."	['Some dolphins are frolicking in marshes.']
Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the passage?	"A recent report has suggested that air pollution in our big cities could be as damaging to our health. The report put forward practical tips that city people can take to reduce their exposure to city air pollution. Quite a lot, it turns out. * Watch where you walk Avoid walking along busy streets and thoroughfares , instead choosing side streets and parks. because pollution levels can fall by a factor of 10 just by moving a few metres away from the main source of the pollution - exhaust fumes. "" Don't walk behind smokers, and walk on the windward, side of the street where exposure to pollutants can be 50% less than on the leewardside. * Pavement sense When you're crossing a road, stand well back from the kerb while you wait for the lights to change. Every metre really does count when you are close to traffic. As the traffic moves, the gases can disappear in just a few seconds, particularly if the wind is up, which means holding your breath during this period can make a difference, silly as that might sound. Besides, cross the road as quickly as possible. And once you're over, continue along the pavement as far away from the kerb as possible. * Where to sit on the bus Sitting on the driver's side of a bus can increase your exposure by 10% compared with sitting on the side nearest to the pavement. And sitting upstairs on a double-decker can reduce your exposure too. It's difficult to say whether travelling on an underground train is better or worse than taking the bus, but the air pollution on underground trains tends to be less toxic by weight than that found at street level. * Wear a mask Masks can be a good thing, but they only make a difference if they fit tightly and are cleaned regularly. Even the slightest gap to allow you to breathe more easily will _ any advantages. Worse, if you fail to clean or change the mask regularly, something dangerous can form on the mask. So the air you breathe is dirtier rather than cleaner."	"[""Don't get close to traffic whenever it is possible.""]"
What is the main idea of the text?	"One day, our teacher talked about the stereotypes of different people. I learned the stereotypes of Mexicans: they are poor and lazy. I was ashamed of who I was because I am a Mexican and thought that it would be hard for me to be successful. One day in the eleventh grade, we had a discussion in history class. The kid next to me said, ""You look like one of those Mexicans who sell food in the street."" I told him that he was also a Mexican. He said, ""I don't look as Mexican as you. I have light skin."" That was the first time that I'd heard someone say, ""I don't look as Mexican as you."" Could it be that the people who succeed in this country are those who look like an American? Towards the end of the eleventh grade, I was asked to write a restaurant review. When I went to a restaurant, I saw the waiter talking to the chefs and thought they were judging me. I felt nervous but I couldn't leave because I had to write the review. Minutes later, the waiter stopped talking and took my order. He was happy to serve me. I started asking him questions about his restaurant and I guessed that he liked that because he gave me a free dish. After I left the restaurant, I thought, ""That's wasn't bad at all."" Not all people think of me as a failure. Now, I am running for the school president in my senior year. I am not sure if I can win, but I tell myself that if I want to be successful, I have to stop despising myself. I want to prove that Latinos can be successful. I do belong to the United States. An American is a person who overcomes struggles to become successful and that is what I'm doing."	['It is what he does that makes him an American.']
Which of the following is the most suitable title for the passage?	"A high school in Hiroshima City has been the first to do something with DNA in the world. Its students have won praise not only for doing this research but also for presenting their findings to groups of expert scientists. The school is one of the Super Science High Schools allowed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, where students are given an opportunity to study science at an advanced level. Here, students use the same type of hitech experimental laboratories as those found at universities. In these labs, they conduct experiments and research in new fields of study not found in textbooks. As part of this science course, the students, with the help of Hiroshima University, used a machine called sequencer , and over the course of a year and a half they succeeded in decoding the DNA. They then presented their results to academic groups. Achieving a world first might sound very wonderful, but the process of decoding the DNA involved very hard work. The students were also responsible for maintaining the equipment, and they had to read difficult research papers and put in extra study beyond their regular schoolwork. ""Researchers need to work hard. The work was tiring, but the students worked toward their ambitious goal of achieving a world first. They have a great sense of achievement, and the number of students who hope to become biologists has increased,"" said Taruma Akinori, who is in charge of the science course. In addition to the results being added to the scientific community, the students' research paper will be translated into English and made available overseas. Moreover, the students have decided to take on a new challenge in DNA decoding."	['Decoding the blueprint of life']

Why do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer?	"When you were young, ginger ale may have been a popular choice for reducing the unpleasant feelings caused by your upset stomach on the road to get to school. For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to ""commit suicide"" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising, especially in that small amounts of ginger don't seem to do any harm to the mother or baby. Other health benefits from ginger exist as well. Since ginger is often considered to be useful in warming bodies, it can improve the condition of people's joints including knees and ankle joints. Some suggest that ginger can help cure a cough associated with the common cold. Another benefit of ginger is that it seems to have no real side effects, which is one of the main reasons it appears to be safe during pregnancy. But for safety, you should always consult a doctor for instructions on daily use before starting, even with something like ginger that seems to have little to no side effects."

What can we learn from the passage?	"You had me at ""Hello""! It turns out our opening words speak volumes--people take less than a second to form an impression of someone's personality based on their voice alone. We know that our voices can convey information about our sex, age, even body strength and certain personality characteristics, but Phil McAleer at the University of Glasgow and his colleagues wondered whether we make an instant impression. To find out, they recorded 64 volunteers as they read a passage. They then picked the word ""hello"" and asked 320 listeners to mark the voices for personality characteristics--including trust, dominance and attractiveness. Although it's not clear how accurate such immediate judgements are, what is obvious is that we all make them, and very quickly. ""We were surprised by just how similar people's marks were,"" says McAleer. It makes sense that decisions about personality should happen really fast, says McAleer. The impression that our voices convey appears to be related to several factors, such as sex differences and age groups, especially the pitch of voice on the top. For example, the pitch of a person's voice influenced how reliable they seemed. ""A guy who raises his pitch becomes more trustworthy,"" says McAleer. ""Whereas a girl who changes from a high to a low pitch is seen as more trustworthy than a girl whose voice goes up at the end of the word."" It is possible to change some of these aspects of your voice, he says. ""It has been said that Margaret Thatcher and the Queen were both trained to make their voices appear more dominant."" Some aspects, though, can't be changeable. ""The methods used in this paper are familiar, but the conclusions are new and very interesting,"" says Jody Kreiman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. The way the study links personality to attractiveness and reproductive fitness makes sense biologically, she says. The team hope that their work can be used to help create artificial voices for people who have lost their own due to a medical condition, as well as creating lovely and charming voices for satnavs , and other robotics. ""You might also use this kind of work to find the right person to front a team,"" says McAleer, ""you don't want a really unreliable voice running your call centre."""	"[""A guy's pitch convey is different from a girl's.""]"
The author thinks that customer complaints _ .	"No matter what type of business you run, it has to deal with situations in which things go wrong from your customer's point of view. Complaints can be a great source of information for the organizations. So it's important to learn to deal with customer complaints efficiently. Firstly, listen actively to what the customer has to say by keeping comfortable eye contact and giving full attention with no interrupting. You should also show your customer that you do understand him. Secondly, when receiving a complaint you should apologize for the failure the customer has identified. It's important for you to know that your apology must appear _ to the customer, and not an empty exercise. And also you should show the customer you've accepted the responsibility and provide him with choices if you have some in hand or otherwise assure the customer you'll do something about his complaint. Thirdly, talk with the consumer and discover the best means to resolve his problem. There will be times when, after gathering the facts of a situation, you'll be unable to resolve the problem immediately. In this case it's important to let your customer know how long it'll take to take action on his complaint. Fourthly, a simple ""Thank you"" is one way to let the customer know you appreciate the time and effort he has taken to inform you about a problem with your company's service or product you need to know about. Lastly, give your customer something that shows your appreciation for him giving the feedback to you. And let him know you're sorry for the mistake that was made. It isn't necessary to give something that is costly; but a coupon for a free drink or movie is fine. Your professional and well-organized method of dealing with your customer complaints is one more way that will make you stay ahead of your competitors."	['are sometimes beneficial']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"It has been two years since I published my first article on Yahoo!Contributor Network.I was very excited when I saw that what I had written was published on the Internet. I recognized that the content sites such as Associated Content can provide a fertile ground for learning how to become a writer.I was thrifty --I could see that this was an open door for systematically learning some basic writing skills without paying college tuition for classes,all to be finished at my own speed and without leaving the comfort of my own home. During these past few years I gained enough experience and understanding of using Associated Content to try writing.I found writing for that site was not my cup of tea.However,my experience there was positive as I was rewarded with even more learning opportunities just by giving it a try.Through Associated Content I was introduced to the world of bolgs .I decided to learn how to set up a blog myself.Now I'm interested in blogs and continue to work as a writer. Writing for the content site Yahoo!Contributor Network gives me a chance of trying creative writing--news,reviews and numerous lifestyle issues.And all of these topics are my own choices.Then there is an opportunity to meet other writers.Yahoo!Contributor Network has a wonderful in-house messaging system that allows its writers to communicate easily with one another.Not all your tries are satisfactory and easy when you write for a content site,but the benefits are many if you try it.

Who might block the development of Brazil?	Brazil is a federation that consists of twenty-six states and one federal district. The biggest majority of Brazil's population belongs to the Christian religion and almost all of them are Catholics. This is something Brazil inherited being Portugal's colony . Historically, the country was a colony claimed by people from Portugal and this made Portuguese the official language. The Portuguese reached Brazil in 1500 and until that moment it was inhabited by semi-nomadic people. The Portuguese changed Brazil into a country of slaves until 1800, when Maria I of Portugal came to live in Brazil. The Queen did not stay long in Brazil, but during the 20 years of royal presence a lot of changes occurred: commercial ports to United Kingdom were opened; Brazil stopped being isolated from other countries. So at the moment of getting the independence on the 7th of September, 1822, Brazil already had the potential to develop. The Brazilian Empire, Pedro I, abolished slavery in 1888 in the face of Princess Isabel. A lot of European people started coming to Brazil and the industry of the country started working. In the 19th and the 20th century as it has been said above foreign people immigrated to Brazil and basically 5 million European and Japanese people became the residents of Brazil. The beginning of the 20th century was especially marked by the immigration of a lot of Asian people: Japanese, Korean and Chinese immigrants. As a matter of fact Japanese people do not immigrate a lot, and the fact that the Brazilian-Japanese people are the largest Japanese minority in the world does astonish greatly. The majority of the cultural inherits of Brazil are actually Portuguese, due to the fact that Brazil was Portugal's colony for a very long time. The southern states mainly consist of European population and the north and the northeast consist of a mixed population including Africans, Amerindians and Europeans. Most of this population is Roman Catholic. No other country in the world has the same amount of Catholics. The modern tendency of Brazil is the growing number of people calling themselves Protestants. Around 7.4% of the population don't believe any god. Some Brazilians, especially in the northern states are mixed Africans who prefer following the traditional African religions. Only 1.8% of the population chose Buddhism, Islam or Judaism. Though Brazil always tried to maintain democracy, it was failed several times by the dictatorship of Getulo Vargas. This fact could not affect the political situation in the country.

The writer behaved herself like a boy because _ .	A few years ago, when I was still in high school, I met a wonderful and warm teacher. At that time in my life, there were many changes to adjust to, apart from the usual teenage troubles. My parents had divorced, so my elder brother and I had chosen to stay with my dad. Due to the fact that he was keeping the house, we didn't have to move. During this time, my teacher took a special interest in me. Being my English teacher, she encouraged my mind to travel to creativity I had long given up. She brought me out of the shell I built. She became my mother, my older sister, my friend and my teacher. The one thing she couldn't do though was to make me more girly as growing up with only my dad and brother made me a real tomboy. Sometimes, I would be really immature , especially if she was scoring me less than others on purpose. She knew I could do better than what I was handing in and so pushed me to extend further than limits. When I finished school and then after college I was about to leave my hometowns she gifted me a watch that every second, with my pulse, should remind me of the one person who will forever wait and love me without reservation. Time has passed and our friendship is distant, but in my heart, soul and mind, she is the closest I ever got.	['she lived with only men all the time']
A person who wants to offer a submission should _ .	The two European nations - one known for its chocolate, cheese and watches; the other for Ikea, Volvo and the Seventies pop band ABBA - have often been confused for each other among the Chinese. The problem largely results from the fact that both nations' names are read similarly in Mandarin Chinese - Ruidian (Sweden) and Ruishi (Switzerland) - which begin with the same symbol. In an effort to put an end to the mix-up, the Swedish and Swiss consulates in Shanghai have launched a competition on the Swedish Consulate website, asking Chinese people to come up with funny ways to help discriminate the two countries. Submissions can be accepted as a blog post, cartoon, photo, short film or in any other form. The winner with the best submission will receive a 12-day trip to Sweden and Switzerland and will be expected to report back on their impressions of both countries following the trip, the website states. Entries will be accepted until November 20. Sweden and Switzerland aren't the only destinations that have caused confusion among travelers. Last month, a British holidaymaker hoped to explore the architecture of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, but instead mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the Caribbean island of Grenada following a confusing booking mistake. Earlier this summer, two US holidaymakers were flown to the wrong continents after an airline confused two airport names.	['go to the Swedish Consulate website first']

What was the main source of Uncle Tom's problems?	"It was my first day back home since starting college. A lot had changed in the last year. Not with my hometown but with me. I had left as a 17-year-old boy and had now returned as an 18-year-old man. In the city, I was living on my own, had a part-time job and was studying. Even the government recognized I was an adult: I had a driver's license. So here I was, on my summer vacation, walking down the main street with my father, desperate for him to acknowledge how mature I was. When his recognition failed to appear, I took matters into my own hands. ""Dad,"" I said casually, ""I'm thirsty. Let's go for a beer."" It was the first time I'd ever mentioned beer in front of my father, let alone ask him to drink one with me. He turned to me with a curious expression on his face. ""A beer ? Well I guess you're old enough now. Let's go to Sailors' Bar. It's where my cousin Tom, your uncle, used to drink. You remember him, right?"" I had only some vague memories of my uncle. He was _ . We didn't talk about him much. ""What ever happened to Uncle Tom, Dad? I haven't seen him in years,"" I said as we continued towards the bar. ""Neither have I, unfortunately. He was a good kid once. But things changed,"" my father said sadly. As a boy, he explained, there had been no better-behaved boy than Tom. But after leaving school, he moved to the city and fell in with bad company. He started going out every night, drinking in nightclubs and playing cards. Soon he lost everything and had to beg his mum to pay his debts. She agreed on the condition he returned home. My dad took a deep breath and continued his tale. ""Things settled down for a while. He married a lovely woman, gave up his bad habits. But it didn't last. He was soon back to his old ways. He couldn't resist. He was at Sailors' Bar almost every night. His poor mother died of grief and shame. His wife followed her soon after. ""What ruined him was alcohol. He told me once, when a man begins drinking, he never knows where it'll end. 'So', Tom warned me, 'beware of your first drink!' ""He went from bad to worse. Last year Tom sent me a letter saying he had been found guilty of stealing, and sent to prison for ten years."" Dad finished talking just as we reached the front of Sailors' Bar. ""Anyway, here we are. Let's go in,"" he said. But I understood. I put my arm around my father and said, ""I'm not thirsty any more, Dad. Let's go home."""	['His inability to control his drinking.']
What can we learn about Oprah's mother?	Oprah Winfrey has come a long way from her poor childhood home in a small Mississippi town. She was an unwanted child whose parents never married. She was brought up on her grandmother's farm. The possibility that she would become rich and famous was slim. Oprah's mother left her child in her mother's care, so she could go to work in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was a strict and difficult life for Oprah. But it also led the way for her future. She was a highly intelligent child. By the age of three, she had learned to read and write. She also made her first public appearance at that age. Oprah's intelligence was resented by other children of her age. They called her unkind names and pushed her away. Oprah felt very isolated and unwanted. It made her feel worse that she didn't live with her mother and father. She felt that no one loved her. This made her angry and rebellious . These feelings brought her much trouble as she was growing up. She often behaved badly, causing her grandmother to punish her. By the age of seven, she was too much for her grandmother to discipline. Then Oprah went to live with her mother, Vernita, who worked very hard as a housekeeper in Milwaukee. It was hard for her to work and take care of her bright, troublesome child. They lived in poverty in a small apartment. Oprah took out all her angry feelings on her mother. When Oprah was eight, Vernita sent her to live with her father and stepmother in Nashville, Tennessee. But she moved again a few months later when Vernita married a man with two children. Vernita wanted Oprah to be with her and her new family. Unfortunately, she felt she didn't belong with them. She believed she wasn't loved by anyone. Her angry and frustration grew stronger. She struck back by misbehaving and running away from home. Her parents found her impossible to discipline. When she was 14, they tried to send her to a special center for troubled girls. But there was no room for her. So Vernita sent Oprah back to live with her father. Vernon Winfrey was by then a successful businessman and family man. He took one look at his daughter and knew she needed love, guidance and discipline. He gave her all three. It was a turning point in Oprah's life. He was strict about his daughter's education. He gave her homework in addition to her schoolwork. She was allowed to watch only one hour of television a day. She became an A student and a popular girl in her class. Oprah watched Barbara Walters, a famous journalist, and decided that was what she wanted to be. When she was still in high school, she got a part-time job reading news on the radio. In her senior year she won a beauty contest and a four-year scholarship to Tennessee State University. While still in college she was offered a job as a news broadcaster at a local television station. She was the first female and the first African-American newscaster in Nashville. She was promoted to anchor, the most important position on the news team, while still a senior. After Oprah graduated she got a job with a Baltimore news station. But she soon realized that broadcasting news wasn't enough for her. She had to let her personality shine through. She wanted to show emotion when she told a story, not just report it. Meanwhile the station managers were thinking the same way. They removed her from the anchor spot and wondered what to do with her. Finally they put her on an early morning talk show called People Are Talking. No one knew what to expect. The show was a great success. In a very short time, the managers and Oprah all knew what she was born to do. She was everything a talk show host should be. She was so successful that she got a show with a bigger station in Chicago. In 1985 the show was changed to The Oprah Winfrey Show. It was broadcast nationally and soon became the most popular talk show on television. By the age of 35, Oprah Winfrey was one of the most famous celebrities in America.

What is the best title for the passage?	"A man often traveled around and he couldn't buy the seat tickets on the train for his most tours.But he could always find a seat to sit on. His workmates asked him how he could find the seats by accident. ""The method is very simple,just your patience.""smiled the man. His workmates were puzzled. One day, one of his workmates was on business with him.The train car was so crowed that they couldn't even find a place to stand on. ""Let's find seats to sit on,"" said the man. ""Find seats? Just a joke?"" said his workmate.""Just follow me,"" said the man. They pushed their way through the crowds.The workmate wanted to give up , but the man insisted .

"The word""properly""means"" _ ""."	Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. This is an old English saying. It means that we should go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy. We shall also be rich and clever. Is this true? Perhaps it is. The body must have enough sleep. Children of your age need ten hours' sleep every night. If you do not go to bed early, you can not have enough sleep. Then you can not think properly and you can not do your work properly. You will not be wise and you may not become wealthy! Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We should sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep well. When the daylight comes, we should get up. This is the time for exercise. If the body is not used, it will become weak. Exercise keeps it strong. Exercise helps the blood to move around inside the body. This is very important. Blood takes nutrition to all parts of our bodies. The brains in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains. If we keep our bodies healthy, and take exercise, we can think better! Our bodies also need air to breathe. Without air we will die. Get up early in the morning and we can have plenty of clean, fresh air. That will keep us healthy and happy.	['correctly']

What is the passage mainly about?	The Internet has changed our habits, including our habit of sending greeting cards. There are many e-card websites that make it easy to find the right greeting cards. They have greatly changed the way we send greetings to each other. Our lives have become so busy that we have limited personal time. These e-card websites have allowed everyone to easily share their feelings with each other. They include plenty of greeting cards that can be used immediately. The users can choose any card they like, from festival greetings to birthday wishes. In fact, e-cards are perfect for any event. That's why more and more people like to send e-cards. If the users are interested in making their own greeting cards on the Internet, they can create a card within only a few minutes. They allow you to send your greetings on a special date. So you can plan for the occasion when you want to send the card. For example, you can send your e-card on a certain day and then visit the person with some flowers the next day. This will surely create a good impression on the persons you love and give them a great surprise. We have never forgotten the importance of saying sorry to our beloved ones. But sometimes we fail to do so, because we are not brave enough to face those we hurt. Some e-cards allow us to express our feelings in a more thoughtful way. Although some people still would rather buy traditional cards in the shops for the persons they love, especially when they want the cards to last a long time, more and more people are choosing to send greetings on the Internet.

Which of the following is NOT true according of the show?	"Betty is not traditional American beauty. She is unfashionable, has thick red glasses, untidy hair and large metal braces on her teeth. But this hasn't stopped her from becoming one of American's favorite TV characters. So how did she manage to do it? The answer is that charm can be more attractive than beauty. Betty is the main character in a TV show Ugly Betty. The show is about her life as a n office worker at a fashion magazine in New York. The TV show has just started. Betty has many exciting experiences and romantic stories. Betty is often looked down on and laughed at by the people around. But she manages to do better than others with her hard work, charm and wisdom. The show tells us about how a girl goes from an ugly young duck into a beautiful swan. Though you may know the ending of the show from the beginning and the story is familiar to many of us, it has still been a big success in the USA. It has attracted a large number of viewers and won two Golden Globes awards, one of the highest honors for a television program in the USA."" I think you can see a bit of Betty in all of us, and I mean men as well, because it's about the underdog "",says Ashley Jensen, who plays one of the characters on the show. The program is so popular because of the performance of the 23-year-old actress America Ferrera who plays the role of Betty. She brings the character alive on the screen."

According to Santa, the star was _ .	"I just finished the household chores for the night and was preparing to go to bed, when I heard a noise in the front of the house. I opened the door to the front room and to my surprise, Santa himself stepped out from behind the Christmas tree. He placed his finger over his mouth so I would not cry out. ""What are you doing?"" I started to ask. The words choked up in my throat, and I saw he had tears in his eyes. His usual jolly manner was gone. Gone was the eager, boisterous soul we all know. He then answered me with a simple statement""TEACH THE CHILDREN!"" I was puzzled; what did he mean? Santa then reached in his bag and pulled out a FIR TREE .""Teach the children that the pure green color of the stately fir tree remains green all year round,describing the everlasting hope of mankind,all the needles point heavenward, making it a symbol of man's thoughts turning toward heaven."" He again reached into his bag and pulled out a brilliant STAR. ""Teach the children that the star was the heavenly sign of promises long ago. God promised a savior for the world, and the star was the sign of fulfillment of his promise."" He then reached into his bag and pulled out a CANDLE. ""Teach the children that the candle symbolizes that Christ is the light of the world, and when we see this great light we are reminded of he who displaces the darkness."" Suddenly I heard a soft twinkling sound, and from his bag he pulled out a BELL. ""Teach the children that as the lost sheep are found by the sound of the bell, it should ring mankind to the fold. The bell symbolizes guidance and return."" Santa looked back and was pleased. I saw that the _ was back in his eyes. He said, ""Remember, teach the children the true meaning of Christmas and do not put me in the center, for I am but an humble servant of the one that is, and I bow down to worship HIM, our LORD, our GOD."""

What lesson can we learn from the story?	"""Hey, do you know what? Today is May Day!"" my sister announced. ""Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?"" I recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, ""Absolutely not!"" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. ""But Pam was my very best friend ever,"" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, ""Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!""."	"[""We can't expect too much from our friends.""]"
If you want to grow spiritually, it is best for you to _ .	"Being honest are fundamental requirements if you want to grow spiritually and follow your true destination of personal development. It's not simply about being honest with people. While that will make you a better person and a more accepted one it's more importantly about being honest with yourself. Living your life honestly means that you've decided to live openly and to show your true self to others and that you can be relied upon to be trustworthy. On the other hand, dishonesty is all about shade and concealment and living your life in 'dark corners'. When you're dishonest, it means that you remain living in the dark and cannot grow spiritually. Honesty produces trust-trust in ourselves and in all those around us. Trust in turn produces confidence which we all need to overcome life's problems and which also encourages us to take risks in order to achieve our goals. You'll have no doubt you have heard expressions such as ""what goes around, comes around"" and ""you get back, what you give out in life"" and that's very true. If you don't live your lives honestly, you can be assured that the people you'll attract will turn out to be very similar to you and it's therefore unavoidable that one day you'11 be on the receiving end of someone's dishonest actions or words. There may be situations where telling the whole truth causes you to bring a lot of pain on somebody else. For example, John may have told Paul that he can't go on a weekend fishing trip with him because he has a family commitment arranged that weekend. You know differently and that the real reason John isn't going is because he hates Paul. When Paul asks you if you know whether the reason is true, what do you say? Well, in situations like this, it's often better to be economical with the truth. You might say that you don't know why John can't go or that you think he has something on that weekend."" Of course, this isn't telling the complete truth but you are sparing Paul's feelings on something that won't, after all, have strong influence on Paul's future."	['be true to yourself']

Which of the following is TRUE about Gordon Brown?	"Gordon Brown was born in Scotland in 1951.His childhood was a brilliant success because of his intellectual strength.He was accepted into middle school at 10.At 16 he became the youngest student at Edinburgh University. ""At that time, he was a lucky boy, good at almost everything,"" said his old friend Murray Elder.However, setbacks fell on the brilliant boy.After a rugby injury, he became blind in his left eye.Before long, similar symptoms developed in his right eye.""I lay in the hospital bed in total darkness, uncertain about my future,"" said Brown. Looking back into the past, Brown didn't complain about his bad luck.He even said: ""One door closes; you can't play rugby any more, so you focus on other things."" Brown was interested in student politics in university, which helped a lot in his political career later in life. In 1997, Brown was made Chancellor of the Exchequer .He has succeeded in giving the country a high rate of employment and the longest period of economic growth in its history.

Why was hemp banned in many countries of the world?	Much of Canada's forestry production goes towards making pulp and paper. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canada supplies 34% of the world's wood pulp and 49% of its newsprint paper. If these paper products could be produced in some other way, Canadian forests could be preserved. Recently, a possible alternative way of producing paper has been suggested by agriculturalists and environmentalists: a plant called hemp. Hemp has been grown by many countries. It produces fiber which can be made into paper, fuel, oils, textiles, food, and rope. For centuries, it was essential to the economies of many countries because it was used to make the ropes and cables used on sailing ships; colonial expansion and the establishment of a world-wide trading network would not have been possible without hemp. Nowadays, ships' cables are usually made from wire, but scientists are now suggesting that the growing of hemp should be revived for the production. According to its supporters, four times as much paper can be produced from land using hemp rather than trees, and many environmentalists believe that the large-scale growing of hemp could reduce the pressure on Canada's forests. However, there is a problem: hemp is illegal in many countries of the world. This plant, so useful for fiber, rope, oil, fuel and textiles, is a species related to the plant from which marijuana is produced. In fact, marijuana cannot be produced from the hemp plant, since it contains almost no THC(the active ingredient in the drug). In recent years, a movement for legalization has been gathering strength. It is concerned only with the hemp plant used to produce fiber; this group wants to make it legal to grow the plant and sell the fiber for production.	['It is related to the marijuana plant.']

According to the text,_makes Tokelau develop renewable energy project.	Officials say the islands of Tokelau in the South Pacific Ocean have become the world's first territory totally powered by the sun.The move is expected to save money and ease the environmental burden of depending on imported fossil fuels. Tokelau's three main atolls ,or islands,now have enough solar capacity to meet all of their electricity needs.Until now.Tokelau has been 100%dependent on diesel for producing electricity.That has burdened the country with heavy economic and environmental costs. The three atolls of Tokelau are about halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii and are administered by New Zealand. Each atoll received its own solar power grid system.New Zealand officials estimated the cost of the project to build the three solar grids at around seven million dollars.The last of the grids has been completed. It is estimated that oil imports make up to 30%of national income in some parts of the Pacific.The move to solar power could save Tokelau about one million dollars a year.Tokelau will now be able to spend more on social programs to help its citizens. Other South Pacific islands are attempting similar projects.The island nations of Samoa and Tuvalu are aiming to get all of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020.The Cook Islands plans to start moving to solar panels and wind turbines.And most houses in the South Pacific groups of islands will begin to use solar water heaters. East Timor's government has promised that no households in the capital,Dili,would be using firewood for cooking by 2015.It also says 50%of the country's electricity will come from renewable sources by the end of the decade. New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says the country will hold a Pacific energy summit in March this year.He said the meeting would build on the success of clean and affordable energy solutions for Tokelau,Tonga,and the Cook Islands.

What is confirmed by the study according to the passage?	"British paychologists have found evidence of a link between excessive Internet use and depression, a research has shown. Leeds University researchers, writing in the Psychopathology journal, said a small part of Internet users were classed as Internet addicts and that people in this group were more likely to be depressed than non-addicted users. The article on the relationship between excessive Internet use and depression is from a questionnaire-based study of 1,319 young people and adults. The respondents answered questions about how much time they spent on the Internet and what they used it for; they also complete the Beck Depression Inventory---a series of questions designed to measure the seriousness of depression. The six--page report, by the university's Institute of Psychological Science, said 18 of the people who complete the questionnaire were Internet addict.""Our research indicates that excessive Internet use is associated with depression, but what we don't know is which comes first--are depressed people drawn to the Internet or does the Internet cause depression?"" the article's lead author Dr Catriona Morrison said.""What is clear is that, for a small part of people, excessive use of the Internet could be warning signal for depressive tendencies."" The age range of all respondents was between 16 and 51 years, with an average age of 21.24. The average age of the 18 Internet addicts was 18.3 years. By comparing the levels of depression within this group to that within a group of 18 non--addicted Internet users, researchers found the Internet addicts had a higher chance of developing depression than non-addicts. They also discovered that addicts spent more time visiting sexually pleasing website, online gaming sites and online communities. ""The public speculation was further proved by this study. That's to say, over-engaging in websites which serve to replace normal social function might be linked to psychological disorders like depression and addiction,"" Morrison said.""We now need to consider the wider social influence of this relationship and clearly prove the effects of excessive Internet use on mental health."""

The Japanese consider the chrysanthemum as a symbol of the sun because _ .	"Chrysanthemums are to the fall what tulips are to the spring. In ancient China, chrysanthemums (or 'mums' for short) were first planted thousands of years ago. People chose the chrysanthemum as their Flower for October, a symbol of the rest and ease that followed the season's final harvest. Then they symbolized a scholar in retirement and were one of the four noble plants, along with bamboo, the plum flower, and orchid. The Japanese hold the chrysanthemum as a symbol of the sun. They consider the orderly unfolding of its petals to be a symbol of perfection. They also think that a single chrysanthemum petal placed in the bottom of a wine glass encourages a long and healthy life. The Japanese even have a National Chrysanthemum Day on September 9, known as the Festival of Happiness. In the United States during colonial times, its popularity grew such that mums now reign as ""Queen of the Fall Flowers."" Mums remain the most widely grown pot plant in the country and the largest commercially produced flowers. Chrysanthemums generally represent cheerfulness and rest. So they are welcomed throughout the British Isles and North America for any occasion, such as football games and parties. In other countries such as Italy, Belgium and Austria, however, their association with the dead makes chrysanthemums acceptable only for funerals and graves."

What's the main idea of the passage?	"A new study of 8,000 young people in the journal ofHealthandSocialBehaviorshows that although love can make grownups live healthily and happily,it is a bad thing for young people.Puppy love may bring trouble for young people and can cause depression .The study shows that girls become more depressed than boys,and young girls are the worst of all. The possible reason for the connection between love and higher risk of depression for girls is ""loss of self"".According to the study,even though boys would say ""lose themselves in a romantic relationship"",this ""loss of self"" is much more likely to cause depression when it happens to girls.Young girls who have romantic relationships usually like hiding their feelings and opinions.They won't tell that to their parents. Dr.Marianm Kaufman,who works on young people problems,says 15% to 20% of young people will have depression during their growing.Trying romance often causes the depression.She advises kids not to jump into romance too early.During growing up,it is important for young people to build strong friendship and a strong sense of self.She also suggests the parents should encourage their kids to keep close to their friends,attend more interesting school activities and spend enough time with family. Parents should watch for their children's eating or mood changes.If they see some,they need to give help.The good news is that the connection between romance and depression seems to become weak with age.Love will always make us feel young,but only maturity gives us a chance to avoid its bad side effects."

What point does the writer make about decorating objects?	Art is everywhere in our lives.Every manmade object is linked with art--a house,a motor car,a bridge,a chair,a teapot,or a piece of cloth.Throughout history,humans have made articles for a wide variety of purposes;generally for everyday practical requirements.The style of practical objects reflects the outlook and the spirit of the times in which they are made and in consequence style is constantly changing. It seems that humans possess a natural urge to improve constructed objects with decoration:sometimes for beautification,sometimes for religious reasons,sometimes to show off their wealth and power,and sometimes to tell a story.Decoration is not art in itself.Unnecessary decoration can ruin the form and perhaps the function of an object,but when decoration is used with care,it can beautify,produce variety,and add interest. The first essential in every creation is that it should properly _ its purpose;for instance,a teapot should pour perfectly,an easy chair should provide comfortable relaxation,a block of flats should be a pleasant place in which to live,and a factory or commercial building should be a suitable building in which to work. The second essential is that an object should please the eye with its form,line,proportion ,colour and texture ,and it should be capable of inspiring the emotions.For example,contemporary furniture designers must think of form,function and structure,and have taken their lead from the outstanding Scandinavian designs of Denmark,Finland and Sweden,whose preference was for simple functional furniture to suit the architectural environment of the day.Heavy furniture is no longer desirable,and by contrast,modern furniture is often characterised by its good proportion,pleasing lines,simple fittings and attractive structures. Motor vehicles are a perfect example of how design has changed to suit function.Early car design was greatly influenced by the horsedrawn carriage,but today we find functional design satisfying every requirement of practical use and good appearance.Designs in the 1980s and 1990s included streamlining to reduce wind resistance in fastmoving vehicles,and,at the same time,satisfy an important art principle--rhythm.But the cars of today,often half size of their predecessors ,have taken the concept of industrial design way beyond simple strength,comfort and beauty.They now include safety and ecological characteristics,reflecting the need to be environmentally friendly through,for example,reduced fuel consumption,while at the same time satisfying the need to be stylish,and appealing to the eye.For many people,the 21stcentury car represents the greatest work of art.

When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. ""I didn't think it was a big deal,"" Wang says. ""Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought."" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. ""After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,"" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. ""I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,"" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. ""If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,"" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program. According to Ju Haojie, deputy director of the household registration department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, when applying for exchange programs, it saves a lot of trouble if students have a collective hukou registered under the university. But Xie also made suggestions for students with a rural registration. ""If your family has land and a house, it's possible that you'll get a share of compensation in the event of a forced relocation. For those students, I would recommend them not to transfer their hukou,"" he wrote. This doesn't affect students in terms of receiving medical insurance and other benefits at university. 'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. ""I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,"" he says. ""I'll do anything that could help me stay here. After all, there's no turning back for me now."""	['Three']
Why didn't the author arrive at the ceremony on time?	"My transportation was unexpectedly smooth and I arrived at the meeting half an hour earlier. I kept my eyes on the restaurant door. Several customers entered, but not my friend. At 6:00 pm, she sent me a text message: ""Urgent work to finish. Will be 20 minutes late."" I had left my book in the office, so I spent the time thinking of my experiences of being late in China. On my first visit in 1985, punctuality was deeply rooted in the Chinese hearts. There were no traffic jams then. As a teacher in Canada, I always insisted on punctuality. I would open the classroom door to a late student for the first time and the second, but not the third. During the six years I worked for CCTV, I had a Chinese friend whom I often saw at lunch time, or after work. We used to meet at the subway station nearby. He was always late by 10-20 minutes. To my question, ""You were busy?"" he would surprisingly answer, "" No."" Once I asked him to check the clock in his office, he smiled. In March 2015, I got permanent residence in China. The ceremony was scheduled for 9:00 am at the Public Security Bureau on the Second Ring Road. I told my driver I had to get there by 8:40 am. ""No problem,"" he replied. But he thought he had time to drop someone off at the airport before picking me up. I desperately waited for him. Then, to rub salt into my wound, he had to stop at the exit of a gas station. Finally, I entered the room at 9:07 am -- the last guest to arrive!"	['Because the driver estimated the time wrongly.']
Why does the author mention the movie Easy A?	"Certainly, a well-rounded education is the foundation from which all of us spring forth. I am grateful to the many incredible teachers who have inspired me to do greater things, and have fired my enthusiasm for everlasting learning! I have also been honored to have the most amazing teachers in all of my children's lives. These are extraordinary people who not only teach our children, but love them, challenge them, and provide an environment where a child learns how to learn. But, sometimes I wonder if the outline of our educational plan is lacking something. I watched the movie Easy A with my older daughter. The main character's parents were loving, supportive, and built great confidence in their daughter and developed her ability to handle her own problems. There was a scene where the mother was speaking to the younger child and he announced that he received an ""A"" on his spelling test. She replied, ""That' s great, honey, but everything has spell check these days. "" It was funny --- but TRUE ! I don't mean that we shouldn't teach our children how to spell, but maybe some of our time should be spent educating them about the dangers of posting things on Facebook. Maybe we might want to spend time showing them how real life works - the credit card isn't free money - you will have to pay it back at sometime. Oh, and get this - they charge you for borrowing that money. Perhaps, we should spend some time on interpersonal relationships. I worry that our kids do not know how to relate to one another. Choosing a career is a daunting task. My daughter is in her second year in college and has changed her major twice. It' s not that she didn't know what she wanted to do. What she ""wanted to do"" and the degree she chose did not match. I have learned many college students do not know what they want to do because they haven' t seen what it looks like in the real world. Being a journalist in the real world looks very different from writing stories. Maybe if we spent some time exposing them to real life experience - maybe two or three courses m areas of interest in high school that give them a ""feel"" for what that particular field would look like, they might be better prepared. I do not know the solution, but it seems that it should at least be a topic of discussion."	['To lead to the topic he is going to talk about.']
Which of the following is TURE according to the test?	"Imagine going to sleep then waking up speaking another language. It may sound impossible, but it's actually happened. The phenomenon of being able to suddenly speak another language is known as""Xenoglossia"", from the Greek words""xenos""(foreigner)and ""glossa""(language). _ once happened to a 13yearold girl from Croatia. After being unconscious because of a disease for 24 hours in 2010,she woke up speaking fluent German. The girl, who came from the town of Knin in the south of Croatia,was studying German at school but she'd only started recently. Her parents said that she'd been reading German books and watching German TV at home, but that she wasn't fluent in the language.However ,since waking up, she's been able to communicate ""perfectly""in German.What's really strange is that she's now unable to speak Croat,her mother language.Doctors at Split's KB Hospital have asked some experts to examine the girl as they try to find out what caused the change.Dr Mijo Milas said,""In earlier times this would have been considered as a miracle ;we prefer to think that there must be an explanation--it's just that we haven't found it yet."" In 2007,Matej Kus from Czech became unconscious after a motorbike accident. On waking up 45 minutes later,he could speak fluent English.Matej was only 18 years old at the time, and had just started studying the language and so was at a low level.Peter Waite,Kus's teammate said,""I couldn't believe what I was hearing.It was really clear English.It was unbelievable to hear him talk in unbroken English.""Unluckily,Matej's new language skills didn't last.Two days later, when he recovered fully from the accident, he'd completely forgotten his English. We still don't know exactly what happened to the two people. Perhaps scientists will discover something new and exciting. But until then, keep studying!"

To a foreigner, the most economical way to get around Thailand is renting a _ .	When you are travelling in Thailand, which means of transport is the best choice? You can rent a variety of motorbikes or bikes in Thailand. It seems to be very popular in most of the beaches and islands along the places in the north. The most popular bikes are the little 125 cc Honda Dream which you can get for about 150 baht a day or as little as 3,000 baht per month, making it the cheapest way to tour Thailand for the people from other countries. Sometimes you will have to go somewhere by taxi. When you are in cities in Thailand, especially in Bangkok, always remember to get a taxi that is traveling on the roads. Some drivers outside hotels refuse to use the meter . They will ask a price which is several times the price when they use the meter! The quality of the roads in Thailand is generally pretty good, so renting cars is another way to get around. The big car rental companies may offer you slightly older cars at a very reasonable price. It is a little surprising considering that the cost of buying a car in Thailand is more than that in the West. Petrol is also reasonably priced in Thailand, more expensive than American prices, but much cheaper than what is paid in Europe. In the past, Bangkok could be a difficult place to drive in--signs were generally in Thai only, making it a hard job to find exactly where you were by looking around. But now, the situation is improved. In a lot of places, even the farthest corners of the country, street signs are in both Thai and English.	['bike']
In Europe, the umbrella was first used against rain _ .	To us it seems so natural to put up an umbrella to keep the water off when it rains.But actually the umbrella was not invented as protection against rain.Its first use was as a shade against the sun. Nobody knows who first invented it, but the umbrella was used in very ancient times.Probably the Chinese were the earliest to use it in the eleventh century BC.We know that the umbrella was used in ancient Egypt and Babylon as a sunshade.And there was a strange thing connected with its use: it became a symbol of honor and authority.In the Far East in ancient times, the umbrella was allowed to be used only by royalty or by those in high offices. In Europe, the Greeks were the earliest to use the umbrella as a sunshade.And the umbrella was allowed in common use in ancient Greece.But it is believed that the earliest persons in Europe to use the umbrella as protection against rain were the ancient Romans. During the Middle Ages, the use of the umbrella practically disappeared.Then it appeared again in Italy in the late sixteenth century.And again, it was considered a symbol of power and authority.In around 1680, the umbrella appeared in France and later on in England. By the eighteenth century, the umbrella was used against rain throughout most of Europe.Umbrellas have not changed much in style during all this time, though they have become much lighter in weight.It wasn't until the twentieth century that women's umbrellas began to be made in a whole variety of colors.

If you do not use your arms or legs for some time, _ .	If you do not use your arms or your legs for some time, they will become weak, and when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again. Everybody knows that. Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong. If a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents may be blamed, and few of us know that it is just his own fault . Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but usually they have better memories? This is because they cannot read or write and when they have to remember things, they cannot write them down in a small notebook. As a result, they have to remember days, names, songs and stories, so their memory is being exercised the whole time. So if you want to have a good memory, learn from the people: practice remembering things in a way as other people do.	['they will become weak']
Where can you find everybody reading a newspaper?	Tokyo is one of those places that you can love and hate at the same time. In Tokyo there are always too many people in the places where I want to be. Of course there are too many cars. The Japanese drive very fast, but in Tokyo they often spend a long time in traffic jams . Tokyo is not different from London, Paris and New York in that. It is different when one wants to walk. At certain times of the day there are a lot of people on foot in London Oxford Street. But the streets near the Ginze in Tokyo always have a lot of people on foot; and sometimes it is really difficult to walk. People are very polite; there are just too many of them. The worst time to be in the street is at 11: 30 at night. That is when the night-clubs are closing and everybody wants to go home. There are 35,000 night-clubs in Tokyo, and you do not often see one that is empty. During the day, most people travel to and from work by train. Tokyo people buy six million train tickets every day. At most stations, trains arrive every two or three minutes, but at certain hours there do not seem to be enough trains. Although they are usually crowded, Japanese trains are very good. They always leave and arrive on time. On a London train you would see everybody reading a newspaper. In Tokyo trains everybody in a seat seems to be asleep, whether his journey is long or short. In Tokyo, I stood outside the station for five minutes. Three fire-engines race past on the way to one of the many fires that Tokyo has every day. Tokyo has so many surprises that none of them can really surprise me now.	['On a London train.']
The passage mainly tells us that _ .	"I have a rule for travel: Never carry a map. I prefer to ask for directions. Foreign visitors are often puzzled in Japan because most streets there don't have names. In Japan, people use _ in their directions instead of street names. For example, the Japanese will say to travelers, ""Go straight down to the corner. Turn left at the big hotel and go past a fruit market. The post office is across from the bus stop."" In the countryside of the American Midwest, usually there are not many landmarks. There are no mountains, so the land is very flat . In many places there are no towns or buildings within miles. Instead of landmarks, people will tell you directions and distance. In Kansas or Iowa, for example, people will say, ""Go north two miles. Turn east, and then go another mile."" People in Los Angeles, California, have no idea of distance on the map: They measure distance by means of time, not miles. ""How far away is the post office?"" you ask. ""Oh,"" they answer, ""It's about five minutes from here."" You say, ""Yes, but how many miles away is it?"" They don't know. People in Greece sometimes do not even try to give directions because visitors seldom understand the Greek language. Instead of giving you the direction, a Greek will often say, ""Follow me."" Then he'll lead you through the streets of the city to the post office. Sometimes a person doesn't know the answer to your question. What happens in this situation? A New Yorker might say, ""Sorry, I have no idea."" But in Yucatan, Mexico, no one answers, ""I don't know."" People in Yucatan think that ""I don't know"" is impolite. They usually give an answer, often a wrong one. A visitor can get very, very lost in Yucatan! One thing will help you everywhere -- in Japan, in the United States, in Greece, in Mexico, or in any other place. You might not understand a person's words, but maybe you can understand his body language. He or she will usually turn and then point in the correct direction. Go in that direction, and you may find the post office!"	['there are different ways to give directions in different parts of the world']
What can be inferred from the passage ?	A group of Mississippi hunters who shot and killed an alligator weighting 910 pounds on Sunday, were amazed when they discovered that the animal already bore injuries caused by musket from the Civil War era. A total of 9 bullets was found, and the various tests and analysis have confirmed that they were indeed fired at the animal in the 19th Century. Nine of the wounds on the animal are believed to have been caused by Enfield Pattern 1853 muskets. These old injuries were concentrated around the animals tail and hind legs, suggesting that the alligator could have possibly been used as a target for shooting practice by Confederate troops. The huge animal also bore five other bullet wounds from three different calibers of hunting guns, as well as many dents and scars, which shows that it survived many firearm injuries in the past. It did not however, survive the six 50-caliber bullets fired at him by the group of amateur hunters from Jackson, who were finally able to take it down. The bullets were confirmed as true musket from between 1850 and 1870. This incredible animal brings a whole new view on this large animal native to the southeastern United States. American alligators have been known for years to live well over 50 years and were thought capable of possibly living as long as 70 or 80 years, but this one was estimated to have been 185 years old at the time of its death. Others like turtles, have been known, to have lifespans of over 150 years, but it is the first of crocodile of such an old age ever found. It is also one of the biggest alligators ever killed in the United States. The heaviest ever recorded, weighing in at an unbelievable 1,011.5 lbs, was pulled out of a river in Alabama in August of this yea.	"[""People's understanding of American alligators may be changed""]"
In this passage the writer expressed his following emotions to his parents EXCEPT _ .	"In the days following the first anniversary of my dad 's death, I felt sad. I still missed him so much. I would walk over to his old house where my daughter now live and still expect to see him sitting out on his front porch . I would see him in my dreams, looking young and strong again. I felt bad too because I regretted not spending more time with him while he was here. I wished I had visited him more, talked with him more, and listened to him more. I wished I had asked the questions that I never did. I wished I had given him more hugs and told him I loved him more often. I wished I had cherished the time I had with him here. I was angry at the destiny because Dad and Mum had both passed away before I was 50, and I was angry with myself because I hadn't made the most of time I had with them. Today, I found myself walking under a cloudy sky, staring at the leafless trees. As I walked along, one of the last golden maple leaves fell from its tree and sailed in the wind until it landed in front of me. I picked it up and smiled. At the moment of peace I felt a sound in my heart and mind: ""death is momentary , but love is eternal ."" I knew at that moment that my relationships with Mum and Dad were not over. We would see each other again in a place of love, joy and light. We would spend our days in learning, laughter and love."	['gratefulness']
The main idea of the passage is that .	The seas and rivers are being poisoned by radioactive wastes, by chemical discharges and by the dumping of dangerous raw swage . The air we breathe is polluted by smoke and fumes from factories and motor vehicles; even the rain is poisoned. It's little wonder forests and lakes are being destroyed and everywhere wildlife is disappearing, and yet the destruction continues. Governments and industries throughout the world are intensifying their efforts to extract the earth's mineral riches and to destroy its living resources. The great rain-forest and the frozen continents alike are seriously threatened, despite the warnings of the scientific community and the deep concern of millions of ordinary people. In fact, we can create environmentally clean industries, use the power of the sun, wind and waves for our energy needs and manage the finite resources of the earth in a way that will safeguard our future and protect all the rich variety of life-forms which share this planet with us.

From the story we can know that _ .	"In Jewish history, King Solomon is considered to be the wisest man who ever lived. There are many stories about the wisdom of King Solomon. Here's one. One day two women came before the King. They carried with them a little baby, which was set down on the floor, at the foot of Solomon's throne. One of the women said ""Five days ago I gave birth to a child. This woman and I live in the same house, and three days later she also gave birth, but that same night her child died, and at midnight she arose and, while I was sleeping, took my son away from me, and laid her dead child in its place. When I awoke in the morning I thought at first that my son was dead, until I realized that it was not my child."" ""No,"" interrupted the second woman, ""she is lying, my lord, she is lying! The living child is mine and the dead is hers!"" ""No,"" cried the first woman, wildly. ""No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine."" King Solomon raised his hand for silence. ""One of you says 'my child lives and yours is dead ', and the other says 'your child is dead and my child lives': there is a simple way to resolve the matter. Bring me a sword."" A sword was brought, and the crowd waited to see what the King would do. ""Very well,"" he said, ""cut the child in half, and give them each half."" The first woman turned pale. She said in a trembling voice. ""Give her the child. I beg you, do not kill it."" But the other woman's face remained hard. ""Let it be neither mine nor yours,"" she said, ""divide it as the King has ordered."" Then Solomon arose, and pointed to the first woman. ""The child belongs to her,"" he said. ""Give her the child, and do not kill it. She is its mother."" Word of this judgment spread throughout Israel, and people marveled at the wisdom of the King. The lesson of this story is rather simple. It is easy to tell the people who really care: they are willing to give up their half in order to keep the whole alive. In short, sometimes insisting on getting your fair share is still a losing strategy."	"[""sometimes you'll lose more if you insist on getting your own share""]"
What can be the best title for the short story?	"First Frenchman: I once heard someone shout, ""Look out."" I put my head out of a window and a glass of water fell on me. It seems that ""look out"" may mean ""Don't look out."" Second Frenchman: I was once on a ship and heard the captain shout, ""All hands on deck . I put my hands on the deck and someone walked on them."" Third Frenchman: I once went early in the morning to the doctor's and his nurse came to the door and said, ""he's not up yet. Come back in half an hour."" When I went a second time for him, she said, ""he's not down yet."" I had to go away again. Later I thought the doctor should be in the house in the evening, so I went there once more. ""Oh, how sorry I am! He's not in ! I'd better tell him to wait for you if you could come tomorrow."" said the nurse. ""Well! He's not up, he is not down, and he is not in. please tell me where he stays!"" I said angrily."

What can we learn about eggs from the text?	*What prevents depression:tea,coffee or hot chocolate? Women who drink for or more cups of coffee a day are a fifth less likely to become depressed.Drinking two or three cups reduces the risk by 15 percent. This is the result of a study of 51,000 women over ten years, published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association. One theory is that caffeine reduces the effect of the chemical adenosine in the brain, which can make us feel sleepy by slowing down nerve cell activity. Some anti-depressants also work by blocking the adenosine receptors. Coffee was found to be far more influential on depression levels than hot chocolate or tea due to the high caffeine content. *How many eggs can we healthily eat: one a day or two a day? Neither-eat them freely. We've long been warned to stick to two or three eggs a week because of their high cholesterol content. But according to the Food Standards Agency, there is no recommended limit to how many eggs we can healthily eat, unless you have been told to cut down by your doctor. There is no evidence that eating eggs raises cholesterol levels, and researchers found that eggs contain less cholesterol than in the past because hens are no longer given bone meal, which was banned in the 1990s after the BSE cresis. Research by the British Egg Council found that a medium egg gives you around 100 mg of cholesterol, a third of the 300mg recommended daily limit.

What will the author most probably talk about next?	If a sitcom that lasts for l0 years is considered popular, then surely one that still arouses emotions after 20 must be considered a classic. Friends first aired in the US in 1994, telling about six young men and women in New York.Since then, it's become one of the most famous titles in the sitcom style, aired in over 100 countries and regions in the world. The show is typical among those who grew up in the 1990s because it explores basic yet important themes like friendship, struggling to survive in a big city, and finding independence and identity, all of which are still relevant to young audiences today. Against the background of the Internet age, IT staff who were once marginalized and laughed at have been brought back to life due to the popularity of hit show The Big Bang Theory, in which four talents lacking normal social skills make an attempt at living on a college campus. At the same time, Gossip Girl, describing a young cast of New Yorkers born with silver spoons in their mouths, showing the difficulties upper-class adolescents experience. The play's fashion and mature subject matter allowed it to draw the interest of both teenagers and adults. Although these typical TV shows cover a wide timeline and a variety of themes, they all have a universal topic. Why are they still appealing? It remains to be found out.

"The American thought ""a ring"" should be a _ ."	"Like most English children, I learned foreign languages at school. When I made my first visit to the United States, I was sure I could have a nice and easy holiday without any language problem. But how wrong I was! At the American airport, I was looking for a public telephone to tell my friend Danny that I had arrived. An American asked if he could help me. ""Yes,"" I said, ""I want to give my friend a ring."" ""Well, that's nice. Are you getting married?"" he asked. ""No,"" I replied, ""I just want to tell him I have arrived."" ""Oh,"" he said, ""there is a phone downstairs on the first floor."" ""But we're on the first floor now,"" I said. ""Well, I don't know what you are talking about. Maybe you aren't feeling too well after your journey,"" he said. ""Just go and wash up, and you will feel a lot better."" And he went off, leaving me wondering where on earth I was: At home we wash up after a meal to get the cups and plates clean. How can I wash up at an airport? At last we did meet. Danny explained the misunderstanding: Americans say ""to give someone a call"", but we English say ""to give somebody a ring"". When we say ""to wash your hands"", they say ""to wash up"". And Englishmen start numbering from the ground floor so the first floor is the second for Americans."	['present']

Rosy is David's _ .	"The story is about two old people named David and Rosy Jackson. Both of them had very bad memories. For example, Rosy would forget to cook dinner or take vegetables home after paying for them. David would show up for work on Sundays, thinking it was Monday. One winter they were to take a long plane trip. When they arrived at the airport, there were only ten minutes left. In that situation, anyone would get into the plane right away. But David and Rosy didn't do so. They went to buy some flight insurance instead. Immediately after they put a two-pound note into a machine, their policy came out. ""Who would get the money if the plane crashed, I wonder?"" asked Rosy. ""My mother, of course,"" her husband replied. ""We should post the policy to her. Now, be quick! Give me a stamp, will you?"" he said to Rosy. ""The plane is going to take off in another minute."" David put the stamp on the envelope, dropped it into a postbox, and suddenly he let out a cry.

From the passage we can conclude that the author _ .	"In the early days of the Internet, the idea that it represented an entirely new and separate field distinct from the real world was seized upon by both supporters and critics of the new technology.Supporters liked the idea that the virtual world was a placeless datasphere, liberated from constraints and restrictions of the real world, and an opportunity for a fresh start.For instance, John Perry Barlow, an internet activist, issued the ""Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"" in February 1996.He thundered, ""Governments of the industrial world, I come from cyberspace, the new home of mind.Cyberspace does not lie within your borders.We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. Where Mr.Barlow found the separation between the real and virtual worlds exciting, however, critics regarded it as a cause for concern.They worried that people were spending too much time online, communicating with people they had never even met in person in chat rooms, virtual game worlds and, more recently, on social - networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook.A study carried out by the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in 2000, for example, found that heavy internet users spent less time talking to friends and family, and warned that the Internet could be ""the ultimate isolating( ) technology"". Both groups were wrong, of course.The Internet has not turned out to be a thing apart.Unpleasant aspects of the real world, such as taxes, crime and cheating are now characteristics of the virtual world, too.C'amers who make real money selling swords, gold and other things in virtual game worlds may now find that the tax man wants to know about it.Designers of virtual objects in Second Life, an online virtual world, are seeking to real -world lawsuits in order to protect their intellectual property. At the same time, however, some of the most exciting uses of the Internet rely on combining it with the real world.Social networking allows people to stay in touch with their friends online, and plan social activities in the real world.The distinction between online and offline chatters does not matter any more. All these approaches treat the Internet as an extension or an attachment to the physical world, not a separate space.Rather than seeing the real and virtual fields as distinct and conflicting, in short, it makes sense to see them as complementary and connected."

What is said to be a factor affecting our appetite and food intake?	"In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us. Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption. A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite. Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating. This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol. ""Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal."" Brunstrom says. ""This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought."" These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake. What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating. The so-called mindful-eating strategies can fight distractions and help us control our appetite, Brunstrom says."	['How we perceive the food we eat.']
Why was Thelma popular in the community?	"Thelma was such a life-loving and easy-going person that she was always full of energy and never felt sad. When she was at the age of 75, her husband passed away. Her children were afraid she was lonely and suggested that she move to a ""Senior living community "". Thelma thought that was a good idea and decided to do so. Shortly after moving in, Thelma became many activities' director. She loved to organize all kinds of things for the people in the community. So quickly she became very popular and made many friends. When Thelma turned 80, her new friends showed their appreciation by throwing a surprise birthday party for her. When Thelma entered the dining room for dinner that night, she was greeted by a standing ovation and one of _ led her to the head table. The night was filled with laughter and entertainment, but throughout the evening, Thelma could not take her eyes off a gentleman sitting at the other end of the table. When the party ended, Thelma quickly rose from her seat and rushed over to the man ""Pardon me,"" Thelma said, ""Please forgive me if I made you feel uncomfortable by _ at you all night. I just couldn't help myself from looking your way. You see, you look just like my fifth husband."" ""Your fifth husband!"" replied the gentleman. ""Forgive me for asking, but how many times have you been married? "" With that, a smile appeared on Thelma's face as she replied, ""Four."" They were married shortly after that."

What is the text mainly about?	"Television will turn 86 years old on September 7, 2013, and it has never looked better. In its youth, television was a piece of furniture with a tiny, round screen showing unclear pictures of lowbudget programs. In spite of its shortcomings, it became well-received. Between 1950 and 1963, the number of American families with a television jumped from 9% to 92% of the population. As the audience got larger, the technology got better. Television sets became more reliable through the 1960s. Both of the reception and the picture improved. The major networks started broadcasting programs in color. Even greater improvements were coming according to Sanford Brown, who wrote an article forthe Postin 1967. Surprisingly, just about every prediction he made in the article became a reality. For example: All sets in the notdistant future will be color instruments. He also predicted that TV sets would become smaller, simpler, more reliable and less expensive and may forever put the TV repairman out of work. Smaller sets do not, of course, mean smaller screens. TV engineers expect screens to get much bigger. However, today's 3D TV is even farther away, if it's coming at all. There is some doubt whether the public would be eager to pay for it, in view of people's cold reception given to 3D movies. But the technology with the greatest potential, according to Brown, was cable television , which was still in its early stages then. As he predicted, the future of cable television was highly interactive. It wasn't cable television that gave Americans their electronic connection to the world, however. It was the Internet. He even foresaw the future office: using picture phones, bigscreen televisions for conferences, and computers providing information, at the touch of a button. Brown ever said, ""The future of television is no longer a question of what we can invent. It's a question of what we want."""	['The development of television.']
When you fall down in a PE class, both your teacher and your classmates will _ .	Happiness is for everyone. You don't need to care about those people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on. Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads at their free time. In fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. And when you do something good to others, you will feel happy, too. All these are your happiness. If you notice a bit of them, you can see that happiness is always around you. Happiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you cannot always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like arevolving door. When it closes, it also opens. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy and lucky person.	['help you up']

We can infer from the passage that _ .	"People always think men are more skilled than women in driving. Nowadays women appear to have a positive image of themselves as safer drivers than men. In a survey done for insurer MetLife, 51% of women said they drive more safely. The evidence is on their side: Men are 3.4 times more likely than women to get a ticket for careless driving and 3.1 times as likely to be punished for drunk driving. ""Women are on average less aggressive and more law abiding drivers, which leads to fewer accidents."" the report says. However, not all male drivers share the same opinion. Of the men surveyed by MetLife, 39% claimed male drivers were safer. The findings did back them up on one point: automotive knowledge. The report showed that more men are familiar with current safety equipment such as electronic stability control, which helps prevent rollover accidents. Auto safety unavoidably matters to money. Insurance companies focus on what classes of drivers have the lowest dollar amounts of claims, and for now, that mainly includes women. In general, women pay about 9% less for auto insurance than men. A study by the website Insweb also showed that auto insurance rates are lower for women in most states. Among individual states, women get the greatest advantage in Wyoming (where they pay 20% less), South Dakota and Washington, D. C., where their insurance costs are 16% lower. ""More than 11,900 male drivers died in U.S. traffic accidents in 2009, compared with just under 4,900 women drivers,"" according to the study. ""Based on miles traveled, men died at a rate of 2.5 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, v.s. 1.7 deaths for women."""	['women are generally safer drivers than the opposite sex']
That day the girl ran to the cage _ .	"Years ago while lying in my hammock and drinking JD from the bottle, I noticed my dog dragging something under the fence.Upon inspection, to my disappointment, I realized it was the next door neighbor' s 10 - year - old daughter' s rabbit.For years I had watched her come home from school and head straight out to its cage, free it and play with it in the yard.I knew that day would be no different and fearing for our dog, I had to think fast. The rabbit was quite dirty, as if it had put up quite a struggle, so I washed it, combed it with the dog brush and blew it dry with the leaf blower.Upon finishing its grooming I jumped the fence and replaced it back in its cage hoping its death would be written off as ""natural caused"". Back to the hammock and JD.Within the hour the neighbor' s Volvo palled in as usual and out popped the little girl, and as usual she headed straight for the cage.Only this time she stopped about six feet away and screamed: "" D - A - D - D - Y!!!"" Her father, panic stricken, stood looking at the cage.Being the good neighbor that I am, I rushed to fence and asked if there was anything I could do. Her father less than calmly shouted, ""What kind of sick individual would dig up a little girl's rabbit and put it back in its cage?"""	['because she.had a habit of going there to see her rabbit']
How many years was the Kyoto Protocol negotiated before its coming into effect?	The Kyoto Protocol is a plan created by the United Nations for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The plan aims to reduce the amount of industrial gases released into the environment.Some scientists say carbon dioxide and other industrial gases are to blame for climate change around the world.The scientists say such gases build up in the atmosphere and trap heat below.They say this results in increasing temperatures and rising sea levels. The plan is called the Kyoto Protocol because it was negotiated in Kyoto,Japan in December,1997.The goal of the agreement is to reduce the amount of emissions --industrial gases released to below the levels of 1990. Nations responsible for at least 55%of the world's industrial carbon dioxide emissions had to approve the agreement before it could go into effect.The European Union and many other industrial nations quickly approved the Kyoto Protocol.They receive credit for their own emissions if they invest in cleaned technologies in developing nations.Developing nations do not have to meet the emissions requirements of the agreement. The United States produced 36%of the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 1999.But the United States refused to approve the Kyoto Protocol.Before the Protocol was negotiated,the United States Senate voted that any treaty harmful to the economy of the United States could not be signed.President Bush has said that he supports the general idea of the treaty but will not send the treaty to the Senate for approval.Mr. Bush said that the agreement sets unfair differences between industrial and developing nations.He also said that the treaty could cause some Americans to lose their jobs. After the United States rejected the Kyoto Protocol,approval by Russia was necessary for the agreement to come into effect.Russia approved the Protocol in November,2004 and the Kyoto Protocol went into effect on February 16th,2005.157 countries have approved the agreement.

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"There is a place where Christmas lives all year long. It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945. Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store. Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ. Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales. Wayne Bronner said: ""Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase."" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants. Bavarian cultural themes and Bronner's huge store bring 3,000,000 visitors a year. The town is the most popular place for tourists in the state. Bronner's business is aimed at a single day of the year. But that is not too different from other businesses. ""About half of our business is done in the last quarter of the year, in the last three months. And actually when you compare that with most retailers, that follows the same pattern."" Wayne Bronner says the family's long-term planning and willingness to reinvest profits has developed the company into what it is today. Still, it does not hurt to build a business on a holiday which is celebrated worldwide. Currently, about only two percent of sales are overseas. But Wayne Bronner sees room for growth, especially through the Internet."	"[""Wally Bronner, founder of Bronner's, has passed away""]"
We have to hide ourselves to _ when we're watching birds.	"If you want to watch and know something about birds, you must find a good place near the bird nest . Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how to make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards . Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a ""door"". The ""door"" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to color the nest."

The cat named Lucky became famous because _ .	Have you heard about Post Office Cats in Britain? They are mouse hunters. The post office has actually employed cats since 1868. They are not employed to sort or deliver mail, of course, but to protect the mail and keep the population of mice under control. They make sure your morning post arrives free from damages caused by rats and mice. London post offices were the first to try out the experiment. Within a few months the population of mice had _ sharply. Other post offices all over the country were soon using cats in the war against rats and mice as well. Within ten years the pay of the cats was improved from one and a half old pence a day to six or nine pence a day. Now the average rate of pay is about a few pounds a month. Some of the hard-working cats have become quite famous. In 1980, a cat named Lucky stopped an attempted robbery in a Worcestershire post office on her own. As the two burglars made their way in through the window, Lucky started an attack and they fled empty-handed. Another excellent cat was Jerry, of Earls Court post office in London. He served the building for 16 years and was on duty for 24 hours every day. He drove all the mice away. However, there are fewer cats employed by the post office than at any time in the past. With the faster movement of the mail and better surroundings, post office cats are not always needed. But many post offices still employ them and they become great friends with the postmen. According to the post office, there is no plan for their services to be discontinued in the foreseeable future.	['She alone drove two burglars away from the post office.']
What's the best title of this passage?	"The city of Vienna has always been popular for its famous physicians. Around the year 1482 one such well-known physician was Dr. Paul Urssenbeck. His fame came from his ability to predict with certainty whether a patient would recover his or her health or would die. He thus became known as the doctor of death. In his earlier years, he followed the trade of a poor but honest weaver in the town of Deckendorf near Straudigen in Bavaria. It was a time of famine , and he, his wife, and their eleven children were in great need. Then a twelfth child was born, and they could find no one to serve as its godparent. As a last chance, the poor weaver walked to a nearby village and asked an old friend to serve as godfather, but met only rejection. Disappointed and frustrated, the poor man made his way back to his family. While walking sorrowfully through the dense forest toward his home, he said, ""If only I could die."" Suddenly a tall figure dressed in a dark cloak appeared before him, saying, ""You called me. I am Death. What can I do for you?"" As much as the man had previously wanted to die, he now wanted to live. ""I am seeking a godfather for my youngest child. But I cannot find anyone who will serve as his godparent,"" answered the weaver sadly. ""I will accept this responsibility,"" said Death. And thus it happened. Following the baptism , the mysterious godfather took the father aside and said, ""Since I own neither gold nor silver to give to your child as a baptism present, I will make you into the most famous doctor of all times. Whenever you are called to a sick person, I--invisible to others--will seat myself either to the head or to the feet of the patient. If I am seated at the head, then this will show you that hope for recovery exists. If I am seated at the feet, then the patient will die."" Through this gift, the weaver was able to cure many illnesses, for he knew whether the patient who had sought his treatment would be helped by medications, or whether he would die. Soon the previously poor weaver became a wealthy and respected physician. However, his increased wealth made him ever-more greedy. One day, a very wealthy man fell seriously ill, but when Dr. Urssenbeck was called in, and he saw that Death was already seated at the patient's feet. Upon hearing the diagnosis, the relatives could not be comforted, and they offered the physician a fortune if he could heal the man. Then Urssenbeck _ trickery. He quickly had the patient's bed turned around, so that Death was now seated at his head. Thus the man was rescued from Death, and he regained his health. On the physician's way home, Death suddenly appeared before him. ""You unfortunate one, why have you deceived me? In return for the life that you have given back to the rich man, you yourself must now die."" Death spoke with a threatening voice, and disappeared. Dr. Urssenbeck suddenly found himself in a large room where thousands of candles were burning. Death said to him, ""Each of these candles represents someone's life. This tiny stump that is about to go out is yours."" Terrified, Dr. Urssenbeck reached for a taller candle, wanting to take some wax from it to fill his stump, but in doing so he touched his own candle, and it went out, and he fell to the floor dead. That evening his body was found in a valley. He was buried in the graveyard of Saint Stephen's Cathedral."	['Dr. Urssenbeck, the Physician of Death']
Some people can easily learn many things by heart because _ .	We each have a memory. That's why we can still remember things after a long time. Some people have very good memories and they can easily learn many things by heart, but some people can only remember things when they say or do them again and again. Many of the great men of the world have got surprising memories. A good memory is a great help in learning languages. Everybody learns his mother language when he is a small child. He hears the sounds, remembers them and then he learns to speak. Some children are living with their parents in foreign countries. They can learn two languages as easily as one because they hear, remember and speak two languages every day. In school it is not so easy to learn a foreign language because the pupils have so little time for it, and they are busy with other subjects, too. But your memory will become better and better when you do more and more exercises	['they have very good memories']

Why did the writer work at Marshalls?	"""No, no, no, dear, I want that wrapped in red paper."" A middle-aged woman came through my line and talked to me as if my IQ were that of a grade school kid. When I first started working, it was simply a way to decrease the time I spent at home and make my parents happy. I never thought that a year and a half later, I would still be at Marshalls, waiting for this woman to get through my line. I smiled and said, ""Oh, that's no problem."" She bent over the counter to look at the computer and made sure I was doing my job correctly. Her sweater grazed my hand and she smiled like she meant well. I wanted to roll my eyes but instead I just smiled. Ever since I started working here, I've tried not to let people like her get to me. And forget judging a book by its cover, because I have been proved wrong time and time again. The wealthy middle-aged women were far ruder than the teenage boys. At first, I was constantly surprised. Now, I tried not to even guess how the person coming near my line was going to act, because it was never the way I imagine. I never expected people to be so rude and at the same time nice. But for every rude person I saw, at least five pleasant customers came through my line. ""Here you go,"" I handed the woman her receipt and hoped her $5 wine glass was wrapped to her liking. ""Have a nice day!"" I said. And just as I thought I was fed up, the next customer came through. ""She had about one more minute and I was going to tell her to get out of line,"" she whispered to me with a smile."	['To have more time to go out.']
Which of the following things surprised the author most?	Just two weeks ago, I was about to cross a busy road when I noticed an old grandpa with a heavy load on his head just a few meters from me. He looked very weak. A few minutes later, I realized I'd forgotten to cross the road. And he'd seen me looking at him. I love my grandparents so much that whenever I see any old people I won't forget to smile at them. I couldn't let go of this grandpa, either. He came near me and handed me a note on which there was an address. I showed him the directions and said he would need a taxi as it was 3 pm on a hot summer's day. Anybody would faint dead in this weather and I didn't want him to walk all the way. But he looked disappointed. I asked where he had come from. He replied weakly that he was from Chidambaram, about 240 kilometers from where we were. I was shocked because he looked like he could not even take 2 steps without falling. I called a taxi immediately and asked the driver to drop him at his place. The grandpa wasn't ready because he had no money. I paid for his journey and asked the driver to drop him off safely. When I turned to look at the grandpa, who was leaving, tears filled my eyes and I didn't want to leave. Memories of my grandparents flashed in my mind, making me feel like crying. I said goodbye to the grandpa, and some happy tears dropped from his eyes.	['That the old man had come from a faraway place although he was weak.']

College friends are often the best to you because _ .	"Dear daughter, As we drove off from Columbia, I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind. I want to tell you how proud we are. Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great well-rounded student you are. Your academic, artistic, and social skills have truly blossomed in the last few years. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"". I encourage you to be inquisitive, but I also want to tell you: ""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten."" What I mean by that is the materials taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. That is really what learning in college is about - this will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired, after which you must become self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life, the skills of learning will be something you cherish forever. Follow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy. Don't be trapped in what others think or say. Steve Jobs says when you are in college, your passion will create many dots, and later in your life you will connect them. In his great speech given at Stanford commencement, he gave the great example where he took calligraphy, and a decade later, it became the basis of the beautiful Macintosh fonts, which later ignited desktop publishing, and brought wonderful tools like Microsoft Word to our lives. His expedition into calligraphy was a dot, and the Macintosh became the connecting line. Enjoy picking your dots, and be assured one day you will find your calling, and connect a beautiful curve through the dots of yourself . Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience. So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny, evolve yourself into a bi-cultural talent, be bold to experiment, learn and grow through your successes and challenges. When I faced the greatest challenge and opportunity in my life in 2005, you gave me a big hug and said ""bonne chance"", which means ""good luck"" and ""good courage"". Now I do the same for you. Bonne chance, my angel and princess. May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be. Love, Dad (& Mom)"	['your family are far away while college friends are around you within an easy reach']
"According to""Nash Equilibrium"", what will happen if two opponents refuse to cooperate?"	"John Nash, a Nobel Prize winner and a mathematical genius whose struggle with mental illness was documented in the Oscar-winning film A Beautiful Mind, was killed in a car accident on May 24th, 2015. Born in West Virginia, Nash displayed a keenness for mathematics early in life,independently proving Femret's little theorem before graduating from high school. By the time he turned 30 in 1958,he was an unquestionable academic celebrity. At Princeton, Nash published a 27-page thesis that led to applications to economics, international politics, and evolutionary biology. His signature solution-known as a ""Nash Equilibrium ""-found that competition among two opponents,not necessarily governed by zero-sum logic. Two opponents can, for instance,each achieve their maximum objectives through cooperating with the other, or gain nothing at all by refusing to cooperate. It is now regarded e, one of the most important social science ideas in the 20th century. In the late 1950s, Nash began a slide into mental illness. By the time Nash was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994, he hadn't published a paper in 36 years. But like a child cured of a nightmare by the switch of a light, Nash recovered from his illness seemingly by choosing not to be sick anymore. He continued to work, travel,and speak at conferences for the rest of his life. In 2001, the release of the film A Beautiful Mind,based an Sylvia Nasar's 1998 book of the same name, introduced Nash's unusual life story to an international audience."

From the passage we know that _ .	"Bushwick is a tough place to grow up. This part of Brooklyn, in New York City, has a lot of crime. More than half of its 100,000 residents rely on aid from the government. Only 50% of students at Bushwick High School graduate in four years. Some people might say, ""We should help these poor kids who have so many challenges."" But Malaak Compton-Rock looks at the teens in Bushwick and says, "" Go to help kids who have even bigger challenges than you do."" She believes that once young people see the power they have to make things better, they can handle their own problems more easily. So her service group, the Angel Rock Project, took 30 Bushwick kids to Soweto, in South Africa, to help poor families there. Soweto is a township outside the city of Johannesburg. The effort, called Journey for Change, aims to show that any kid can change the world. ""Kids in Bushwick face pressure to drop out of school or become involved in gangs and drugs."" Says Compton-Rock. ""We want them to live a life of purpose and service."" In Soweto, many parents have died of AIDS, a deadly disease.

In the story, _ liked wine and good food very much.	"Once upon a time, there lived a rich man. He had a servant . He and the servant loved wine and good food very much. Each time the rich man left his home, the servant would drink the wine and eat up all the nice food in the house. The rich man knew what his servant did, but he had never caught his servant doing that. One morning, when he left home, he said to the servant, ""Here are two bottles of poison and some nice food in the house. You must take good care of them."" With these words, he went out. But the servant knew that the rich man had said was untrue. After the rich man was away from his home, he enjoyed a nice meal. Because he drank too much, he was drunk and fell to the ground. When the rich man came back, he couldn't find his food and his wine. He became very angry. He woke the servant up. But the servant told his story very well. He said a cat had eaten up everything. He was afraid to be punished , so he drank the poison to kill himself."	['both A and B']
The survey of modem childhood found that many youngsters _ .	"Children spend more time messaging each other on phones and websites than talking in Person ,a survey has revealed. Text messages and social networking sites have become the common mode of youngsters aged 8 to 14. A survey of modem childhood found that many youngsters are conscious that they are spending too much time on their computers and enjoy themselves the most 'when playing outside. But the lure of electronic products proves too strong for a quarter, while a fifth say their parents don't like them playing outside because they are worried about strangers and injuries. The ""iGeneration report"" suggested that youngsters are increasingly health-conscious and skeptical of commercialization, including gender-based labelling on toys and pop videos released by singers. More than half of those questioned care about eating healthily and one in 10 lectures their own parents about the food they are eating or buying. 42 percent of those questioned own a smartphone , with 36 percent admitting to spending more time communicating with friends via instant messaging, such as texts or networking websites, than talking in person Only one child in 100 said that being happy, having a loving family and being clever were taken as the most crucial elements in their lives. Cary Cooper, the professor of organizational psychology and health at Lancaster University , said social media were contributing to youngsters becoming more independent. They had a sense of individuality due to exposure to a range of media. The survey follows major statebacked research which found that youngsters are turning their back on drink, drugs and smoking. It found a dramatic drop in the number of secondary school students trying and regularly using drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Some analysts said that thanks to the rise of social media, millions of teenagers are spending their time at home in their rooms rather than out on the streets."

Why was the Russian pilot arrested?	(ALAUDDIN VALLEY) -- Russia's relationship with Tajikistan has _ following an incident involving a Russian pilot who was arrested -- after making an emergency landing in the Central Asian nation. Russia responded by beginning to drive out Tajik guest workers, a move that threatens Tajikistan's entire economy. In total, some 700,000 Tajik citizens work in Russia. In the past quarter, they sent home some $742 million in remittances . Overall, the money guest workers send back makes up half of the republic's government budget. The Alauddin Valley is in the Fann Mountains in eastern Tajikistan. The place long held an attraction for Russian writers and adventurers. Later, during the Soviet era, it was a popular tourist destination. Yet establishing a strong relationship with the people of the mountainous region is not easy. Men are seldom seen in the area. Nearly every family has at least one breadwinner working in Russia, if not more. The farm work falls to the women, who divide it up among themselves. Each summer, the village chooses the most experienced and skilled women to take all of the cows (up to 300 of them) to the summer pastures high up on in the mountains. The women spend four months there with their children since there is no one to leave the children with. They milk the cows and prepare products for the winter: cheese, butter and so on. These fermented goods get them through the winter when snow and avalanches cut off all contact with civilization. Residents here generally have two questions for visiting Russians. The first one is obvious: Is President Dmitri Medvedev going to limit the entry of Tajik guest workers? The second question is less obvious: Are there cows in Moscow? The Alauddin Valley's women truly can't imagine life without either.	['Because he landed in Tajikistan without permission.']
What can we learn from the passage?	Is there someone you hate? Well, maybe you don't really hate them. But you get really angry every time you think of them. If you don't let this anger go, it can turn into bitterness Bitterness appears when we can't forgive someone who has hurt us or made us angry. Someone might say or do something that hurts us. But Instead of controlling the anger, we keep it deep inside. Before long, a bitter feeling begins to grow. We may think we're hurting that person by criticizing him or her often, but we're really only hurting ourselves. Bitterness can not only lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, but also hurt our relationships with friends and family members. No one enjoys being around an anger person for very long. If you see bitterness in your life, here are some ways to deal with it. Accept it Instead of trying to your anger, make it clear to yourself and accept it. See your anger for what it is and quickly deal with it. Stop making excuses for it You may feel you have a right to be anger. You may think you're right and the other person is wrong. You may even secretly enjoy making the other person look bad. But in the end, bitterness hurts you much more than the other person. The bitterness will hold you back, and the other person will go on with his or her life. Forgive and forget it You probably can't completely put the anger out of your mind. But you can decide to forgive the other person. Forget it and move on. You'll enjoy better health and peace of mind. ,,	['The peace of mind is more important than the hurt itself.']
The writer takes the drug company's lesson as an example to	"Companies trying to market products to mothers need to head onto the Internet with a survey showing the mothers today are online daily, using Facebook to connect to friends and Google to diagnose illnesses. A survey by parenting website BabyCenter.corn found 63% of online mothers now use social media networks such as Facebook regularly, compared to only 11% three years ago.""They don't watch TV as much, they are not reading magazines as much, but instead they check Facebook where people are really drawn together over parenting questions,"" BabyCenter's Editor-in-Chief Linda said.""One of the major activities is looking for comments on products.They are information seeking, particularly when it comes to babies, and companies need to realize this."" Companies also need to know their market well as mothers are sharing information--and complaints--online regularly. A drug company learned the hard way last November when online mothers found an ad targeting moms to be offensivedl , which result in a hot debate on the micro-blogging site Twitter.The company had to take the video ad down from its website and apologized for any offense caused. The online survey also found that mothers aren't going to the doctor as often.Instead they are using the Internet to find out what is wrong with their children and, when they do go to the doctor, asking which drug they should use rather than for a diagnosis.In online communities children's health issues are the leading topic of interest rating as high as 91 percent followed by childhood development tips at 79 percent and product reviews at 72 percent."

McDonald's is used as an example to prove that _ .	"While you may think that being smart and talented would logically make someone successful in running a business, unfortunately, this is often not the case. This problem starts back in school when the stressful ""group projects"" are first assigned .The smartest don't want to risk their grade in the class by dividing the work equally and hoping that an average student does his part well. They just take over and do the whole project themselves. And thus begins the smart-people work cycle. The smartest people do just about everything better than most everyone else until it comes to running a business. They are not better. A smart person who can't stand someone else doing a job badly does everything himself. Then, he is stuck with the one-man band ""job-business"" and ends up not being able to grow. However, it is quite interesting and strange that some ""slackers"" ( a person who is lazy and avoids work) are better suited to be a business leader than the ""smart"" people. Smart and talented people often have a gift for the unusual, complicated or different. They don't like to follow the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid), which is required to make a business succeed. Maybe you think the global presence of McDonald's complex, but in reality, in the company, every single task is broken down into easy-to-follow steps and everything has been standardized. These successful companies have just a few smart enough people to run the majority of the tasks in a way that can't be screwed up by their average employees. So, being smart or talented isn't going to help you unless you can use those smarts to figure out a way to simplify those tasks that will make a business successful. Another issue with the smart people starting businesses is that they often have the most to lose. The smarter you are, the more options you have available to you. You will be able to make a lot of money in various fields and have room in your career to become promoted. This means that when you start a business, you have a lot more to risk than those who are not equally smart. This is often referred to as the _ dilemma. So, don't be surprised when the person ""MOST Likely to Succeed"" from high school ends up as an employee and it is one average student that finds success in his or her own business."

We can infer that the 2003 New York blackout _ .	"During a recent phone interview with a mom who had just moved to Colorado, the conversation turned to disaster planning."" I am standing here looking out of the window at the smoke from wildfires,"" she told me, ""and have absolutely no idea what we will do if the wind shifts our way."" Fortunately, the fire was put out, saving her home. Making a disaster plan isn't something anyone does for fun. But being caught without one in a time of need is worse. Emergency management officials say too few families have a disaster plan ,even in areas that have been hit hard by hurricanes or flooding. I have prepared food, water, flashlights, candles, a battery-powered radio and firewood since our family was hit years ago by a hurricane that blocked off streets and knocked out our power for more than a week. Still we lack the medications, emergency contacts, and emergency-meeting and pet-care plans we should also have .Officials in my state of Oregon have warned us that one of us is really ready for the major disaster which is very likely to hit here---- a big earthquake. Working parents need to coordinate their disaster plans with their children's schools or child-care centers. Many parents in the 2003 New York blackout weren't able to get home to their children because public traffic was stopped and lights were out. After that, many parents made detailed plans with child-care providers about where to meet in emergencies, an whom to contact if unable to reach each other. Good emergency planning and training helped teachers at a child-care center in the World Trade Center successfully move children to a safe place during the 2001 terrorist attacks. Do you have an emergency plan for your home? If not, you know what to do."	['made parents realize the importance of having a disaster plan']
"How many ""terrible things that didn't happen"" are listed in this passage?"	If practicing an attitude of gratitude during the storms of life is too much for you right now, that's OK. When things are tough, most people have a hard time being thankful. They're so caught up in what's wrong in the present moment that they simply can't see some things are still right. If that's true for you, then accept it. You're going through a particularly difficult or unhappy period of time, and you don't like it one bit. Very normal, very human. But remember this: there is always something to be grateful for. It maybe only a small comfort right now, but it is a start. Make a list of some of the terrible things that didn't happen. For example: *You're in debt...but you're not homeless. *You lost your job...but you didn't lose your health. *You broke your leg...but you didn't break your neck. *Your mother has Alzheimer's disease...but your father doesn't. No matter how bad things are, they could always be worse. Start finding gratitude for what might have happened, but didn't. It does help a lot. Of course, you may not be thankful for everything-- but you can always be thankful for something.	['Four.']
Why does the writer advise us to keep a diary?	Are you the only child in the family? If so, you are the most important in your family. Parents are the closest people to you in the world. But a lot of middle school students have a problem. They feel they are not as close to their parents as before. They even don't think their parents are fair to them. Some students complain that their parents often say a lot to them, but never listen to them. Some say their parents don't allow them to play computer games when other people are doing it. Others say when they are making phone calls to friends, their parents like to ask if they're speaking to a boy or a girl. These make them very unhappy. Some students even decided to leave home because they're afraid to tell their parents when they have done something wrong, particularly when they do badly in exams. Then they usually think running away is the only choice . But they don't know running away may bring them some more problems. Problems are parts of life. Here are some suggestions for you to solve your problems. *Find a good chance to talk with your parents. Don't be afraid to tell them your feeling. *Keep a diary to help you understand more about yourself and your feeling. *Get help from others like good friends or teachers. *Show your parents you are growing up. Then they will feel you are no longer a small child. If you follow the advice, you will have a happy life and never think of running away.2*1*c*n*j*y	['Because it can help us understand ourselves better.']
The writer tends to think that_.	Students who say they never or hardly ever used dictionaries often speak English well but usually write poorly, because they make many mistakes. The students who use dictionaries most do not learn especially well either. The ones who look up every word do not read fast. Therefore they do not have time to read much .Those who use small two-language dictionaries have the worst problems. Their dictionaries often give one or two words as a translation of English. But one English word has many English translations in Chinese. The most successful students are those who use large college edition dictionaries with about 100,000 words but do not use them often, When they are reading these students first try to get the general idea and understand the new words from the context .Then they read and use the dictionary to look up only key words that they still do not understand. They use dictionaries more for writing. Also if they think a noun might have an unusual plural form or a verb might have an unusual past form, they check these in a dictionary.

The essay test is preferred because _ .	"For a clearer picture of what the student knows, most teachers use another kind of examination in addition to objective tests. They use ""essay"" tests, which require students to write long answers to broad, general questions such as the following: ""Mention several ways in which Benjamin Franklin has influenced thinking of people in his own country and in other parts of the world."" One advantage of the essay test is that it reduces the element of luck. The student cannot get a high score just by making a lucky guess. Another advantage is that it shows the examiner more cares about the student's ability to put facts together into a meaningful whole. It should show how deeply he has thought about the subject. Sometimes, though, essay tests have disadvantages, too. Some students are able to write rather good answers without really knowing much about the subject, while other students who actually know the material have trouble expressing their ideas in the essay form. Besides, in an essay test the student's score may depend upon the examiner's feelings at the time of reading the answer. If he is feeling tired or bored, the student may receive a lower score than he should. Another examiner reading the same answer might give it a much higher mark. Because of _ , the objective test gives each student a fairer chance, and of course it is easier and quicker to score. Whether an objective test or an essay test is used, problems arise. When some objective questions are used along with some essay questions, however, a fairly clear picture of the student's knowledge can usually be gotten."	"[""it shows more about the student's understanding of the subject""]"
According to the catalogue the writer read, when students finish a sign language course, they _ .	"I was twenty years old, and my parents were looking forward to the day when I would be earning my own living. Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: ""Singer"" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast. It was the hardest thing I have ever done--but also the most rewarding."	['can work in many types of different places']

His father and mother were both doctors and they hoped that their son would become one, too. But one day Tom said to his mother, "" When I finish school, I want to be a dustman."" ""A dustman?"" his mother asked, she was very surprised. "" that's not a very pleasant job, why do you want to be a dustman?"" ""Because then I would only have to work one day a week."" Tom answered at once. ""Only one day a week?"" his mother said, ""What do you mean? And how do you know?"" "" Well,"" Tom replied, "" I know that the dustmen who come to our house to work on Thursday, because I only see them on that day."" ,,."	['Tom said that he wanted to be a dustman.']
The passage is mainly about _ .	"Be sure to book a table if the restaurant you choose is an expensive or a popular one. You will feel embarrassed to show up without booking and having to wait for a table, leaving very bad impression on your friend, especially your girl friend. Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear. When your food arrives, proper dining manners make you eat at a right pace so that you have time to talk. A good measure of how fast you should eat is to count 10 seconds between each mouthful and it's bad manners if you eat too fast and then spend the rest of the time watching your friend eat. Don't make noise when having soup and chewing, or chew with your mouth open. Your napkin should be placed on your lap at all times. Don't put it in any other place. If you have to get up, place it neatly on your seat. When eating, put your fork straight in your mouth. Don't place your fork in the side of your mouth as it increases the chances of dropping your food, which could be very embarrassing. If you get food stuck in your mouth, don't pick it out with your fingers or fork at the table. Excuse yourself and go to the restroom and get it out with a toothpick. When dining, keep your eyes on your friend at all times and try to smile between mouthfuls. Sometimes, you should make an effort to show some interest and ask questions like, ""How do you like the beef?"" If she needs, you are the one who is supposed to flag down the waiter by a gentle wave of the hand until someone notices you."	['dining manners']
The AIDS child gave the speech in order to _ .	He was just 12 years old when he died. But he brought courage and hope to people around the world. Nkosi Johnson, who died last June, is remembered today as an AIDS fighter. This young boy challenged his government's AIDS policies and millions of South Africans in the fight against the disease. Johnson was the longest survivor born HIV positive .He survived with this deadly disease for 12 years before it _ . At first, Johnson was expected to live for nine months when his foster mother , Gail Johnson took him in at the age of two. She now runs Nkosi's Haven across town from her house in Melville. The Haven is home to 20 children living with HIV or AIDS, and 11 of their mothers. Johnson attracted the world's attention and stole the hearts of thousands of people across the world at the 13thInternational AIDS Conference inprefix = st1 /Durbanin July 2000. He stood in front of a large audience including South African President Thabo Mbeki. He told them that he wanted AZT, a drug used to treat AIDS patients, to be given to HIV-positive pregnant women to prevent the disease being passed on to their unborn babies. He received a loud cheer at the end of his speech. Johnson's speech was broadcast live across the world. With views beyond his age and even a sense of humor, Johnson soon became an international sign of the fight against AIDS and HIV.	['get more help from the world']
According to Professor Cook, the rings of the trees _ .	"Half of the world's population is affected by Asian monsoons , but monsoons are difficult to predict. American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. ""If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability."" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. ""There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive flooding."" said Eugene Wahl, a scientist with America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""So, to get a sense of what the regional moisture patterns have been, dryness and wetness over such a long period of time in great detail, I would call it a kind of victory for climate science."""

What can we infer from the passage?	Some people love going to museums,while others absolutely hate it and would rather stay at home,enjoying their favorite TV shows.Increasingly,museums are being seen as outdated and boring by today's youngsters. I have just returned to the UK after travelling around the USA.While there,I visited lots of museums I must say,museums are typically educational, either to develop knowledge gained at school in particular subjects,or to enhance knowledge of other cultures In Chicago,we visited the world-famous Art Institute of Chicago.It was filled with paintings,drawings and sculptures by a huge variety of artists,such as Picasso,Monet,Matisse and Dali.There was a mixture of traditional and modern art,including colorful stained glass windows and abstract art. When we were in Washington D.C.,we visited a few of the Smithsonian museums. These are all free to visit-which is great if you just want to see a few things,and not spend all day inside.The Air and Space Museum was particularly good:it had lots of aircrafts and rockets on display,interesting information and also some interactive parts.We also went to the National U. S. Holocaust )Memorial Museum. Naturally,it was sad to read about the horrors of this tragedy which affected so many people in World War II .However,it was also incredibly interesting to read the stories of those who survived the Holocaust,as well as those who helped others. Last but not least,I also found the 9/11 Memorial and Museum to be of great interest. This museum is dedicated to those who lost their lives,as well as their families,when the Twin Towers in New York City were attacked by terrorists in 2001 .It tells you how the terrorists planned the attack,how they hijacked the planes,and ultimately what happened as a result of their actions.Surviving pieces of the towers are shown in the museum,alongside damaged fire engines. It was a truly thought-provoking visit,which made me value my own life that little bit more. I think museums play an important role in preserving artifacts of historical importance for future generations.Whatever your interests,there is likely to be a museum for you. You can visit waxwork museums to see models of your favorite celebrities(and get photos with the Queen!),science museums for a more hands-on,interactive visit and so much more!Best of all,if you're ever in the UK,many of them are free!

What's the best title for the passage?	Soap operas and sitcoms are two kinds of popular TV shows. What are the differences between them? A soap opera is usually very long and has many episodes .All the episodes of a soap opera are _ The first soap opera was on radio in the late 1930s. One of the most famous soap operas is Friends. A sitcom, or a situation comedy, is a set of funny stories. These stories all happen in a small place, like a house or a workplace. Sitcoms are different from soap operas. Each story in a sitcom can be a different one and sitcoms make people feel happy. There is a very popular sitcom on TV in China. Everyone likes it. Do you know it? It is Home With Kids.

In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish _ .	While your pet fish may appear to be ignorant of your presence, chances are that it knows you extremely well and can probably even identify you from a crowd of human faces! At least, that is the conclusion reached by scientists the University of Oxford in the U.K. and the University of Queensland in Australia, following an extensive study of the archerfish , a species of tropical fish that can be found all the way from India to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. The ability to distinguish between human faces is a complex task. That's because we all have the same basic features -- two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. It's only the subtle differences that make humans distinct from one another. Since this requires a combination of both visual sense and memory, researchers had always assumed that _ was a skill possessed only by those with complicated brains, i.e., humans, a few select animals -- such as horses, cows, dogs, monkeys and some birds, like pigeons. To test if this assumption was accurate, a team of scientists led by Dr. Cait Newport, Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, decided to study fish. The aquatic animals have small brains that lack the neocortex , or neocortex-like structure, believed to help recognize the subtle differences between human facial features. The team began by presenting four archerfish with images of two human faces. Initially, the fish spat randomly at both. However, they soon learned that pouring water at the one selected by the researchers earned them a food treat. After that, they focused primarily on that image. The researchers then took the experiment one step further, by introducing 44 other human faces to the mix. To the researcher's astonishment, the trained archerfish were able to recall the learned image almost 81% of the time. And this accuracy improved to 86% when the researchers made the identification even harder, by replacing the colored photos with a set of black and white images and hiding the shape of the head.

The writer probably agrees that _ .	"Assertiveness is the ability to confidently express your opinions, feelings,attitudes, and rights, in a way that doesn't infringe the rights of others. Many of us are taught that it is not nice to consider our own needs above those of others. If someone says or does something that we don't like, we should just be quiet and try to stay away from that person in the future. Why is Assertiveness important? If you don't know how to be assertive, you might experience: *Depression - Anger, a sense of being helpless, hopeless, or of having no control over your life. *Resentment - Anger at others for taking advantage of you. *Frustration - Why did I allow that to happen? Most people find it easier to be assertive in some situations than in others. This makes perfect sense. It's a lot easier to hold your ground with a stranger than with someone you love. But the more important the relationship is to you, the more important it is to be assertive. Assertive behavior leads to increased respect from others! But before you decide to act assertively, you have to decide if you can live with the results. Although assertive behavior usually will result in a positive response ,some people might react differently. How to be effectively assertive: *Use ""I"" statements. Keep the focus on the problem you're having. ""I'd like to be able to tell my stories without interruption."" instead of ""You're always interrupting my stories ! "" *Use facts, not opinions. ""Did you know that shirt has a hole?"" instead of ""You're not going out looking like THAT, are you?"" *Express ownership of your thoughts, feelings, and opinions. ""I get angry when he breaks his promises. "" instead of ""He makes me angry. "" * Make clear and direct requirements. Don't invite the person to say no. ""Will you please?"" instead of 'Would you mind...?"" or ""Why don't you...?"" *Keep repeating your point. Use a low level and pleasant voice. Don't try to explain yourself."	"[""you should consider others' response before you act assertively""]"
People who _ could probably realize their dreams.	Even in early time, people could realize the important of dreams and knew that dreams gave meaning to life. Every great achievement has been the result of years of dreaming. If a person has a dream and holds fast to it, he or she will find a way to bring it into reality . Children do not have much experience or knowledge. However, they are natural dreamers. We should not laugh at them for being _ . Many great men were dreamers when they were children. One such dreamer was Thomas Edison. He used to be ostracized when he was in primary school, but his achievements were greater than everyone else's in his time. Teenagers and young people should also be encouraged to dream. The world is full of successful teenagers and young people. They dreamt big and their dreams changed their lives and even the world. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are the good examples. They have developed technology and brought great progress to human besides making money for themselves. Older people should believe that it is never too late to dream and that human mind is never too old to make dreams turn into reality. Colonel Saunders realized his dreams at the age of 67 and set up the biggest fried chicken company (KFC) in the world. To dream is a wonderful ability which can lead to wonderful results. Olympic records were broken by players who were brave enough to dream. No one is too young or too old to dream and to make dreams come true.	['dream and hold fast to them']
We can infer from the text that _ .	"This fourth of July I moved into a new house with my wife, Nicole. Nicole and I met through a series of _ that would be unlikely without some unbelievable force causing them to happen. The day Nicole and I met, we talked about the Yankees. In the restaurant where we sat, the first game between the Yanks and Tampa Bay was being shown on television. Nicole was happy I was a baseball fan, and she told me that was an important reason when she considered dating me. ""My dad wouldn't like me dating anyone who isn't,"" she said. Nicole's dad, Ira, used to be a coach for the Yankees. Many years ago, a colleague of his was leaving and packing up his office. The only thing left unpacked was a photo on the wall. It was a picture of Sparky Lyle, a famous baseball player. Sparky had signed the photo on the bottom. ""You're not taking that?"" Ira asked. ""You want it?"" his colleague offered. ""Sure!"" Ira said. He jumped at the chance to have a signed photo from a great player who had helped the team win two World Series. Ira told me the story after the movers had gone. He then said to me, ""Adam, when I first learned who was dating my daughter, that photo came into my mind,"" he said. ""But by now, I know for sure you're meant to have it."" He then presented me with a box. I tore it open. Inside was the signed photo of Sparky Lyle which I had lost years ago. ""To Adam, Best Wishes, Sparky Lyle"". It was picked up by Nicole's dad years before I'd even met her. The perfect gift -- a sign only making me believe what I already knew ... I was meant for Nicole and her family all along."

What attitude of the Mom towards her daughter's suggestion at first?	"She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired, freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart. We all waited, some patiently, others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always memorized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day. Her voice was so sweet as it broke the trance we were all caught in, ""Mom, let's run through the rain."" she said. ""What?"" Mom asked. ""Let's run through the rain!"" She repeated. ""No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit."" Mom replied. This young child waited about another minute and repeated: ""Mom, let's run through the rain."" ""We'll get soaked if we do."" Mom said. ""No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,"" the young girl said as she pulled her Mom's arm."" ""This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?"" ""Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, if God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!"" _ No one came or left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's lifetime when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith. ""Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If get wet, well maybe we just need washing."" Mom said. Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they ran past the cars . They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked but they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars. And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing. Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories. So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories every day!"	['Negative']
The writer saw his daughter's purse right after_.	Our daughter Kerrin, a student at Boston University, had been home for a week-end visit, and I dropped her off at the bus station just in time for her back to college. After Kerrin's bus had gone and I was driving away, I noticed that she had left her purse on the passenger seat. Worried that she would arrive in Boston without money or keys to her room, I called my wife, Bette Jean, on the car phone, explaining why I would be late. As I was following the bus, Bette Jean phoned me back to say she had phoned the bus dispatcher on the other line and he, in return, had phoned the bus driver on yet another phone. The driver asked me to wave out of my window to show where I was. Then he pulled over at a rest stop, and I did the same. Kerrin jumped off the bus, and I handed her the purse and went on my way.

According to the famous teacher in England, a teacher can _ .	"""Depend on yourself"" is what nature says to every man. Parents can help you. Teachers can help you. But all these only help you to help yourself. There have been many men in history. But many of them were very poor in childhood, and no uncles, aunts or friends to help them. Schools were few. They could not depend upon themselves for an education. They saw how it was and set to work with all their strength to know something. They worked their own way till they became well known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, ""I can not make worthy men of you, but I can help make men of yourself."" Some young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable to the human beings. They can never gain achievement unless they see their weak points and change their course. They are nothing now, and will be nothing as long as they live, unless they accept the advice of their parents and teachers, and depend on their own efforts."

The text above is probably taken from _ .	Working women make up nearly half of the U.S. workforce, and 51 percent of professional workers, like doctors, lawyers, nurses and accountants, are female. While climbing the career ladder can be rewarding, it often comes with one big downside: weight gain! New research published this week in the International Journal of Obesity shows that working women are more likely to be overweight, and the more you work, the more pounds you're likely to pile on. Like many women, I work... a lot! As a self-employed nutrition communications specialist, I sit at my desk, in front of a computer, for hours on end. Sitting alone is one of the worst things you can do for your health, and it's directly linked to being overweight and increased fatness, so the fact that women in the workforce gain weight isn't that surprising. If you work, you have less time to move around. Obesity researchers are revealing many other ways that employment is harmful to your diet and waistline. In the International Journal of Obesity study, some 9,276 Australian women aged 45-50 had their body weight and employment status monitored for two years. Results? Those who worked more than 35 hours were likely to gain weight compared to those who worked fewer hours or were out of the workforce. What's more, the more hours a woman worked in a week, the more weight she gained. The authors of the Australian study attribute weight gain among working women to inactivity, lack of time for food preparation, more use of prepared foods, high levels of stress, lack of sleep and consuming more alcohol. I'll also add in travel, meals eaten out and working at night as other factors that I can find to make balancing work with a healthy diet a challenge.	['a health and fitness magazine']
The article published in The Harvard Mental Health Letter indicates _ .	"Comparative thinking and behavior is quite typical among teenagers, but it is the responsibility of the parent to set limits and hold firmly to them. Frequently, a parent will tell me in frustration about how their child has complained about not having the very best in fashion design like their friends, or the latest electronic gadgetry that all the other kids own. Parents need to teach their children selfconfidence. Those who are selfconfident resist the urge to compare themselves to other people, and do not overestimate others' experience while diminishing their own. But some people may have a mantra signified by the slogan, if only. ""If only I had the money of my brother; if only I was smart like my classmates; if only I was as goodlooking as my friends."" Comparing oneself with others is a trap. People who compare themselves with other individuals tend to feel that they are not good enough. They tend to perseverate about their shortcomings. Even if they try their best,it is not good enough because they can always find someone who performs at a higher level. When people compare, they generally focus on their negative traits. They ignore all that is going right in their life. They also tend to minimize their success and dismiss positive gestures and compliments. Those who are confident listen to their own inner voice. They are not influenced by other people's view of events. They are not overly impressed by others' success, money, health,and material possessions. They do not believe that others have a greater sense of emotional wellbeing than they do. Recently, The Harvard Mental Health Letter published an article which indicated that people with chronic pain had as significant a sense of wellbeing as those without chronic pain. However, those with chronic pain tended to overestimate the emotional wellbeing of physically healthy people. The study confirmed that it is how we view events that is important, not the nature of our circumstances which may include making comparisons."	"[""chronic pain actually doesn't affect people's sense of happiness""]"
According to the author, what opinion do most ESL students hold?	One of the speaking rules you need to know might sound strange to most ESL (English as a second language) students, but it is one of the most important rules. If you want to pass examinations, then study grammar. However, if you want to become fluent in English, then you should try to learn English without studying the grammar. Studying grammar will only slow you down and confuse you. You will think about the rules when creating sentences instead of naturally saying a sentence like a native. Remember that only a small part of English speakers know more than 20% of all the grammar rules. Many ESL students know more grammar than native speakers. I can confidently say this with experience. I am a native English speaker, majored in English Literature, and have been teaching English for more than 10 years. However, many of my students know more details about English grammar than I do. When they sometimes ask me about grammar, I can easily look up the definition and apply it, but I can't tell them the answer _ I often ask my native English friends some grammar questions, and only a few of them know the correct answer. However, they are fluent in English and can read, speak, listen, and communicate effectively. Do you want to be able to recite the definition of a causative verb, or do you want to be able to speak English fluently?	['Grammar is very important in English learning.']

The best title for the passage is _ .	Marie Curie, born in Sklodovka, Poland in 1876, led a hard life as a girl. Her parents, both teachers, had small salaries and were quite poor, especially after her mother stopped teaching to raise five children and take care of her poor health. Marie's mother suffered from tuberculosis and died of it when Marie was ten. When Marie was small, she showed great interest in science. She loved to study and hoped to become a scientist when she grew up. Her parents encouraged her interest in science. Excellent as she was in her studies, she couldn't go on with the advanced education she needed because Poland was then ruled by Russia and women were not permitted to go to college. In order to continue her education, she smoothed away many difficulties and entered Paris University. she lived a simple life and studied hard, so she graduated with the highest grades in her class. After graduation, she was engaged in scientific research in Paris University. There she met Pierre Curie, whom she married later. Pierre joined her in her research into an unknown phenomenon radiation, which a certain scientist had declared the uranium gave off. The Curies spent several years trying their best to find the element that produced radiation. Finally they succeeded in 1902. Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes, one for physics in 1906, together with her husband and another scientist who had also contributed to the research, the other for chemistry herself in 1911.Marie Curie was a scientist of great achievement, and the first woman ever to be honoured in the Nobel Prize history.

Teens reporter talked with Lin Dan. the program director of the Sunshine in Your Heart Project at the Red Cross Society of China. How will the earthquake affect the teenagers mentally? They'll have feelings of fear, anger and feel they are not safe. They will find it hard to focus. They will tend to cry and shout and tremble. And they might be afraid to be alone. What will happen if they are not helped? The teenagers will find it hard to live in a balanced way. If things get worse they might not be able to focus on their studies. They might give up on life. How can we help them overcome these problems? The first thing is to build up trust with them. Show your sympathy and sadness, and be their friend. Then you have to give them a sense of safety. Tell them that there's a solution to every problem. Thirdly, try to satisfy their psychological needs. Be a good listener if he or she needs to talk. Some of us were not directly affected by the quake but have seen images on TV and feel scared. What should we do? Talk with an adult and/or share your feelings with someone who might feel similar. If this doesn't help then you should see a doctor for professional help.	['solve every problem they have']
At the time of its fall, the Bastille housed _ .	Why was Bastille important to the citizens of Paris? The building of the Bastille had been started in 1370 under Charles V. By the seventeenth century, it had stopped to be important for defense. Cardinal Richelieu turned it into a prison. It was not an ordinary prison to punish common crimes. Its huge doors closed only on enemies of the King. The Bastille's workings were secret. Prisoners were taken to it in closed vehicles. Soldiers on guard duty had to stand with their faces to the wall. No talking was allowed. Worst of all, a prisoner never knew if he would be there a day, a week, a year, or forever. Only the King's letter could set him free. Over the years, the number of arrests by King's letter had become fewer. By the time of its fall, most of the prisoners were writers who had written against the corruptions of the government. Voltaire, the famous French writer, spent a year there in 1717-1718, and another 12 days in 1726. For those who believed in free speech and free thinking, the Bastille stood for everything evil. The day it was captured, only seven prisoners were found inside. Still, the Bastille was hated by the people. It was a symbol of the King's complete power.	['only a few prisoners']
A _ red knot wading bird has a better chance to survive during its migrating flight.	As skies are filled with millions of migrating birds, European scientists say the seasonal wonder appears to be strange: The fatter the bird, tile better it flies. The results of their study led to a theory opposite to a central one of aerodynamics , which says that the power needed to fly increases with weight. For birds, obviously, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much smaller than we used to think. Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers. Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream. Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive. The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight. In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated flights. They forced a small amount of special water into the birds' bodies so that they could measure the amount of energy burnt during the flight.	['fatter']

Steven Lash thinks Bangkok's hospitals _ .	"While most travelers aim to stay out of the hospital while on vacation, a growing number of medical tourists-people who combine treatment with travel - are crossing international borders for the purpose of getting medical services, which can range from a hip replacement to a tummy tuck. Widespread air travel, increasing healthcare costs in developed countries, long waiting lists and an ageing world population have all contributed to a global increase in medical tourism in the past decade. And Asia takes the lead in terms of world market share. More than 89% of medical tourists travelled to Thailand, India or Singapore in 2010, with Bangkok and Singapore leading the pack. But the cost of hotel rooms and treatment are both far more expensive in Singapore than in the Thai capital, making Bangkok the most popular place for medical tourism in the world. Even after the serious floods of 2011, 19 million tourists visited Thailand in 2011, a 20% jump from 2010, with about 500,000 tourists travelling specifically for medical treatment. Given Thailand's reputation for outstanding service, it is not hard to see why Bangkok has quickly become the medical tourism centre of Asia. The Tourism Authority of Thailand(TAT), which began medical tourism in 2004, has a detailed medical tourism website that lists many of the most popular treatments available, including dental work, dermatology and cosmetic surgery, as well as listing reputed hospitals, making it easy for potential visitors to decide on a procedure. TAT has also recently partnered with Krungthai Bank, the national bank of Thailand, to offer tourists a card called the Miracle Thailand Card, which offers some medical and life insurance coverage in case of an accident. ""The hospitals in Bangkok are some of the highest quality in the world,meeting US standards,""said Steven Lash, CEO of a US-based medical travel company that sends tourists to Bangkok as well as to seven other countries, including Turkey and Mexico. ""All of the tourists we have sent to these hospitals have given us excellent feedback on their procedures and their experiences at the hospitals."""	['are really excellent']

Family meals provide the chances for parents to do the following things EXCEPT _ .	Good nutrition and a balanced diet will help your children grow up healthily .No matter how old your kids are , you can take steps to improve nutrition and to encourage smart eating habits .Here are some suggestions. Family Meals Family meals are comforting for both parents and kids. Children like to guess what they are going to have and parents get the chance to introduce new food to children and to find out which food they like and which ones they don't. Teens may turn up their noses at your plan of a family meal. It is not surprising because they're trying to establish independence. Yet studies find that teens still want their parents' advice, so use the mealtime as a chance to reconnect. Stocking up on healthy food Kids, especially younger ones, will eat mostly what they can get at home. That's why it's important to control the supply lines -- the food which you serve for meals and have on hand for snacks. You should have enough fruits, vegetables, lean meat and other good sources of protein, such as eggs and nuts, and healthy snacks, such as yogurt, peanut butter and whole-grain biscuits. Being a good example The best way for you to encourage healthy eating is to eat well yourself. Kids will follow the lead of the adults they see every day. By eating fruits and vegetables and avoiding fast food and sugary drinks, you'll be sending the right message. No conflicts over food Parents might find themselves shouting at children to get them to have healthy food in front of them. This in fact can make children dislike what they are aske d to eat. Get kids included Most kids will enjoy making the decision about what to make for dinner. Talk to them about making choices and planning a balanced meal. It can help them make good decisions on their own about the food they want to eat.	['guessing what kids are going to have']
During the trip, Jeff Gardner _ .	"It's hard not to feel cheated and over-charged when you receive unexpected roaming charges while traveling abroad--whether they come from making phone calls or checking e-mails. Jeff Gardner received an $ 11,000 bill from Verizon after spending four days in Jamaica. Before the trip, Mr. Gardner, who runs a fly-fishing business in Grayling, Michigan, said he called Verizon to find out what it would cost to use his cellphone for calls and his wireless card to check e-mails while in Jamaica. He said he was told that calls would be about $ 2 a minute and that there would be no extra charges for data as he was on an unlimited plan. _ . ""I don't mind paying a fair amount for fair service, but $11,000 for four days is ridiculous,"" said Mr. Gardner, who used his phone carefully and economically on the trip. He also tried to check and send e-mails using his wireless card, but quickly gave up after the e-mails didn't go through. Still, his Verizon bill said more than 500,000 kilobytes of data was delivered while he was in Jamaica, an amount Mr. Gardner said is 100 times what he normally uses in a month. As travelers increasingly use smart phones abroad in the same way they do at home--to check e-mails, update Facebook and Twitter and pull up online maps--many are facing costly roaming fees, which providers charge when customers use their phones outside their service area. In fact, roaming charges have gotten so out of hand that the Federal Communications Commission has proposed a plan that would require wireless companies to send their customers a voice or text message when they are approaching their plan's limit, when they have reached that limit and when they are starting to result in roaming fees."

On June first she would begin a year as a national and international spokeswoman for education. Kimberly Oliver was the first National Teacher of the Year from her state. She taught five-year-old children at a public school in Maryland, near Washington, D.C. President Bush honored her and other top teachers at the White House. Kimberly Oliver said she wanted people to understand that the first several years of a child's life were the most important for learning. She said investing in children at a very young age would result in great gains later in school and in life. She called on parents to read to children from an early age so they would not fall behind in school. One of the activities at her school was an event called "" Books and Supprer Night "". Families read together at the school and received free books to take home. Parents, children and teachers also ate dinner together. Broad Acres Elementary School was in a poor area. Many of the parents were immigrants with limited English. Kimberly Oliver helped improve learning environment at her school. She received money to buy electronic learning systems, tape players and books in English and Spanish and sent them home with students. Parents said she had shown them how to help their children at home. She was born and raised in Delaware. She held one degree in English and another in Elementary Education. Kimberly Oliver would follow in the footsteps of another teacher Jason Kamras from the Washington area as National Teacher of the Year.

Which of the following is NOT true?	Astronauts, people who fly into space, need special training. First they go to Houston, Texas. That is the home of the Johnson Space Centre. There they are tested to see how strong and smart they are. One of the first tests is for the heart. The people walk or run, then the space doctors see how fast their hearts are beating. Another important test is performed. In this test the person must curl his body up in a ball. When he is in that position, he is put into a round cloth bag. The doctors give him no idea how long he will have to stay in the bag. If a spaceship broke down in space, the astronauts would get into bags like this. Then they would have to wait and curl up in darkness, until help could arrive. You can see that an astronaut must not be afraid of tight space or darkness. After the tests, only the best people are chosen to start astronaut training in a training centre. The astronauts in training learn many other things. They learn how to jump out of a moving airplane. They learn to how to blow up a lifeboat and get into it while they are in the ocean. The astronauts also have to learn how to get lifted out of the ocean by helicopter . That may look fun, but it can be dangerous. After they finish training, the astronauts continue to work. They stay in good shape by running and doing exercise. They read about their special jobs. In that way they can learn new facts about space travel. Then the big day comes. The astronaut is told to go to work on a flight into space. The crew members get to know each other first. Then they can learn which job each will do.	['The crew members get to know each other after the tests.']

The major cause of sleep-deficit of modern people is _ .	"Judging from recent surveys, most experts in sleep behavior agree that there is virtually an epidemic of sleepiness in the nation.""I can't think of a single study that hasn't found Americans getting less sleep than they ought to,"" says Dr.David.Even people who think they are sleeping enough would probably be better off with more rest. The beginning of our sleep-deficit(lack)crises can be traced back to the invention of the light bulb a century ago.From diary entries and our personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have reached the conclusion that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night.""The best sleep habits once were forced on us, when we had nothing to do in the evening down on the farm, and it was dark."" By the 1950s and 1960s, the sleep schedule had been reduced dramatically, to between 7.5 and 8 hours, and most people had to wake to an alarm clock.""People cheat in their sleep, and they don't even realize they're doing it,"" says Dr.David.""They think they're okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, when they really need 7.5, 8 or even more to feel ideally energetic. "" Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researches say, is the complexity of the day.Whenever pressures from work, family, friends and community increase, many people consider sleep the least expensive item on their programs.""In our society, you're considered dynamic if you say you need only 5.5 hours' sleep.If you've got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition."" To determine the consequences of sleep-deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or recall a passage read to them only minutes earlier.""We've found that if you're in sleep deficit, performance suffers,"" says Dr.David.""Short-term memory is weakened, as are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate."""

According to the text,e--bikes are practical for _ .	Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the $3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the $1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the $1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

Shop owners often hire moonlighting police as parking attendants so that shoppers _ .	"High-quality customer service is attached great importance to by many, but actually keeping customers happy is easier said than done. Shoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store , but instead will alert their friends, s, co-workers and even strangers. Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers frequently go to their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde Group and Wharton School. ""Storytelling hurts retailers and affects customers,"" said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde Group. ""The store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement."" On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four others, and will no longer visit the specific store. For every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative review. The resulting ""snowball effect"" can be disastrous to retailers. According to the research, shoppers who bought clothing met with the most problems. Ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers. The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople. During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved parking problems by getting moonlighting local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance completely got rid of the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided the situation in which several customers eyed the same parking space at the same time. Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions. Most importantly, salespeople should be good at dealing with different people and especially should be polite with angry customers. ""Retailers who're helpful and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren't so friendly,"" said Professor Stephen Hoch. ""Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help."" Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by bringing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. It's impossible for retailers to improve when they have no idea what is wrong."	"[""won't have trouble parking their cars""]"
"""Jazz capital of the world"" refers to _ ."	"Have you ever wondered how your favorite NBA team received its famous name? All NBA teams have an interesting story or a history behind their names. Some of the names reflect the city's culture or history, others came from previous owners and many were selected through ""Name the Team"" contests. For teams like Los Angeles and Utah, the names were not always a reflection of the city. Even though Los Angeles has no lakes, the Laker name has been a city treasure for almost 40 years. Before going to Los Angeles, the team originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1948, team officials chose the name for its direct relationship to the state's motto, ""The Land of 10,000 Lakes."" The team name went unchanged after moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Because Utah's team originated in New Orleans, Louisiana, it was called the Jazz. In 1974, New Orleans club officials chose the name to represent the city for its reputation as the ""jazz capital of the world."" The name stayed with the team even after finding a new home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979. The Chicago Bull's original owner, Richard Klein, named the team the Bulls. He picked the name because a fighting bull is relentless, and never quits. Klein, who founded the club in1966, believed these qualities were necessary for a championship team and hoped his Chicago athletes would live up to the team name. A belief that Bulls----winner of the six NBA championships have definitely followed. In 1967, the Indian Pacers selected their team name in a different way from most other teams. Their decision was based on what they wanted to accomplish in the NBA. Team officials chose the Pacers name because the organization wanted to set the ""pace"" in professional basketball"	['New Orleans']
"What does ""getting cut"" mean?"	When I was in my first year of high-school I tried out for my school's basketball team. Although I was very successful in other sports, particularly soccer and baseball, I was only a mediocre basketball player. I remember walking into the gymnasium and feeling shocked when I saw how many people were also trying out. I knew I was a good athlete, but I didn't know if my skill would be as good as the other participants. Try-outs lasted for four long days. At the end of each day, the basketball coach had a short discussion with each player. He told some of the players to come back for the next day, and told other players that they had not made the team. This is called getting cut. All of us were afraid of getting cut at the end of each practice. On the fourth day of try-outs there were only twenty kids left. I was one of them, but we all knew only eighteen students would make the team. This day was the most intense day of them all. There were many opportunities to impress the coach but there were so few people that the pressure was very high. I was not one of the best players on the team, so I was especially worried on this last day. At the end of practice the coach told every player to take one shot from the same spot. Many kids missed their shot but mine went in the basket. After practice we waited as the coach talked to each player. When my turn finally came my heart skipped a beat when I walked towards the coach. My head was spinning when the coach started speaking and I was almost shaking because I was anxious. The coach told me that I had done very well and that he was impressed. However, the team only eighteen spots and unfortunately none of these would be mine.

The air quality index reading of the city once reached to an extreme of _ .	"Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, has issued smog warnings for three days since Monday because of serious air pollution. The lingering smog forced construction sites to stop work and primary and middle schools to suspend outdoor activities. From Monday through Wednesday, the city's air quality index reading remained high, with the highest reading at 323, with PM2.5, or particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns, as the main pollutant, according to the city's meteorological bureau. Any reading over 300 is considered ""seriously polluted"". The city experienced at least eight heavily polluted days in the first two weeks of December, with the air quality index reading reaching a high of 440, China News Service reported. Among those affected was a square dancing team in Jiang'an district, which had to stop daily practices after several members fell ill. Square dancing is a common open-air fitness practice across China, with most of the participants middle-aged or elderly women. Media reported the leader of one dancing team had to go to a hospital after she had an asthma attack on Dec 11. Identified only as Fang, 65, the dance team leader said she decided to suspend the practices after she learned her illness was caused by smog, and after several other members also fell ill, the report said. The city plans to invest 28 billion yuan ($4.61 billion) in air pollution control by 2017. The plan says the city will boost the development of clean energy vehicles for public transportation and remove all of the current 140,000 heavy-polluting vehicles from Wuhan's roads by the end of 2016."

Which is the best title of the passage?	"I once had my Chinese MBA students brainstorming on ""two-hour business plans"". I separated them into six groups and gave them an example: a restaurant chain. The more original their idea, the better, I said. Finally, five of the six groups presented plans for restaurant chains. The sixth proposed a catering service. Though I admitted the time limit had been difficult, I expressed my disappointment. My students were middle managers, financial analysts and financiers from state owned enterprises and global companies. They were not without talent or opinions, but they had been shaped by an educational system that rarely stressed or rewarded critical thinking or inventiveness. The scene I just described came in different forms during my two years' teaching at the school. Papers were often copied from the Web and the Harvard Business Review. Case study debates were written up and just memorized. Students frequently said that copying is a superior business strategy, better than inventing and creating. In China, every product you can imagine has been made and sold. But so few well developed marketing and management minds have been raised that it will be a long time before most people in the world can name a Chinese brand. With this problem in mind, partnerships with institutions like Yale and MIT have been established. And then there's the ""thousand talent scheme"": this new government program is intended to improve technological modernization by attracting top foreign trained scientists to the mainland with big money. But there are worries about China's research environment. It's hardly known for producing independent thinking and openness, and even big salary offers may not be attractive enough to overcome this. At last, for China, becoming a major world creator is not just about setting up partnerships with top Western universities. Nor is it about gathering a group of well-educated people and telling them to think creatively. It's about establishing a rich learning environment for young minds. It's not that simple."

It is a leading cause of death among the elderly. But Alzheimer's disease is not confined to the aged. There may be a million or more people under the age of 65 suffering from the disease. At one time, people suffering from the disease were said to be ""getting old"". The disease was thought to be a natural part of growing old, but it is now known that Alzheimer's disease strikes young and old alike. It is an organic disease that destroys brain cells. Alzheimer's disease affects the patient's memory, speech, and movement. In the beginning stages of the disease, the patient may seem slightly confused. He may have trouble speaking, then the patient's memory begins to fail. He may forget dates, numbers, names and plans. As the disease progresses, the patient may not recognize family and friends. These symptoms often cause terrible anxiety in the patient. He may feel lost and frightened. Sometimes the patient reacts with wild and bad behavior. In the last stages of the disease, the patient may not be able to take care of himself. He may have lost the ability to speak and walk. Scientists don't know exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease. It may be caused by a virus .It may be caused by a poisonous substance in the environment. At present, there is no cure for the disease. But there are ways to slow its progress. Exercise and physical treatment can help the patients of this disease."	['is an organic disease that affects young and old']
Which of the following is true?	"The average global temperature has increased by almost 0.5 centigrade degree over the past century; scientists expect it to rise by an extra 1~3 degree over the next 100 years. Warmer weather makes glaciers melt, adding more water to the ocean. The warmer temperature also make water expand, so it takes up more space, causing the sea level to rise. The sea level has risen about 10~25 cm in the last 100 years. The main cause of global warming is human pollution. Through burning coal, oil and gas, people have been increasing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as CO2. This adds to the power of the greenhouse effect, making the planet even warmer. Many scientists believe that, if the warming is not stopped, there will be huge climate changes. The sea level could rise to one metre this century. Should this come true, millions of homes will be swallowed up by the sea and the world will be flooded with ""climate refugees"" looking for somewhere to live?"

What was the most probable cause for Linda's weakness?	"Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him. She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"He is a lesson to every boy who ever picked up a basketball and dreamed that it would change his life. The lights were never brighter and the crowds were never bigger for a homegrown sports hero than they were a quarter-century ago for Ray Hall. But his athletic achievements, as impressive as they are, are to my mind not what is most admirable about the man. Known as ""Sugar Ray"" in his teens, Hall was rated among the country's top 25 high school basketball players. An inner-city kid from a solid family, Hall took on the challenge of lifting Canisius College -- still recovering from its failure -- back to respectability, rejecting more favorable offers. His status of a savior brought more pressure than any 18-year-old should have to handle. However, I watched him mature into the player who led Canisius back to daylight. After college Hall played professionally in Italy and Greece for over 10 years until a car accident at 32 ended his basketball career. The news that he would never play again shocked Hall but unlike so many others he was ready for life after basketball. When I met Hall -- still fit at 46 -- for lunch Monday, he wore a cut-sharp gray suit, designer tie and blazing white shirt that screamed Success. ""That was always the question -- when the cheers end, where do you go? Who do you turn to?"" he said. ""It starts and ends with that person in the mirror."" Hall got the concept of academics-first from his parents. He graduated from Canisius a semester early. ""No matter how good of an athlete you are, you are just one injury away from losing it all,"" he said. ""But if you take care of things academically, you are prepared until you leave this earth."" For the past 14 years, he has been in a computer sales job at Ingram Micro. He married his college sweetheart. They have three kids and a nice house in the suburbs. He figured out early what others learn too late: Athletics is part of a journey, not the destination. Congratulations, Ray, you made it. In more ways than one."	"[""athletics was not Ray's final goal in life""]"
The writer will not agree that _ .	"A peer is a person who is about the same age as you. Peers affect your life, whether you know it or not, just by spending time with you. Peers can have a good effect on one another. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book and now everyone's reading it. However, sometimes peers affect one another in another way. For example, one kid in school might try to get another to cut class with him, your soccer friend might try to persuade you to be mean to another player and never pass her the ball, or a kid in the neighborhood might want you to with him. Some kids give in to peer pressure because they want to be liked, to fit in, or because they worry that other kids may make fun of them if they don't go along with the group. Others may go along because they are curious to try something new that others are doing. The idea that "" everyone's doing it"" may influence some kids to leave their better judgments or their common senses behind. Peer pressure can be extremely strong and hard to get rid of. Experiments have shown how peer pressure can influence someone to change her/ his mind from what she/ he knows for sure is a correct answer to the incorrect answer----just because everyone else gives the incorrect answer! That holds true for people of any age in peer pressure situations. It can be hard to walk away from peer pressure, but it can be done. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. Inner strength and self- confidence can help you stand firm, walk away and resist doing something when you know better."

At school,when he walked into a classroom full of noisy boys,those boys went red in the faces,and looked down at their shoes.If a boy brought his poor,careless work,which was not the best that boy could do,my grandfather picked up the boy's work and threw it across the room,shouting,""Do it all again,and bring it back early tomorrow morning!""

What do writers use to share their life experiences?	We all have our own ways of sharing our life experiences with others. Photographers use cameras, artists use brushes, musicians use songs and writers use stories. Spencer Johnson's story Who Moved My Cheese? shows changes exist in our life. Life changes and so we do. We must change ourselves to face the changing environment, or we will fail. Just look at the cycle of the seasons. Trees bud in spring and in summer their leaves turn green. In autumn, their leaves start to fall onto the ground. When winter comes, there are no leaves on trees. Next spring the cycle begins again. Since we know there are cycles in nature, we can prepare for them. We know it is colder in winter and hotter in summer, so we can dress properly. Since we accept the cycles of nature, we should also accept the changes in our life. We can prepare ourselves for changes by becoming more flexible . We can regard the changes in our life as chances. As we keep changing ourselves, we can keep up with the changes in our life.	['Stories.']

What does the mimic feel about the new job at first?	"One day an out of work mimic is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performer. As soon as he starts to draw the crowd,a zoo keeper grabs him and drags him into his office. The zoo keeper explains to the mimic that the zoo's most popular attraction,a gorilla ,has died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off. He offers the mimic a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mimic accepts. So the next morning the mimic puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before the crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep all he wants,play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mimic. However,eventually the crowds tire of him and he tires of just swinging on wires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience,he climbs to the top of his cage,crawls across a partition ,and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course,this makes the lion very angry,but the crowd loves it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mimic a raise for being such a good attraction. Well,this goes on for some time-the mimic keeps taunting the lion,the crowds grow larger,and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day when he is dangling over the angry lion he slips and falls. The mimic is terrified. The lion gathers itself and prepares to attack. The mimic is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. Finally,the mimic starts screaming and yelling,""Help me,help me!""But the lion is quick and attacks. The mimic soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says,""Shut up,you idiot!Do you want to get us both fired?"""

What is the best help if you want to know the information about the street address in Kansas?	"Inprefix = st1 /Kansas City,Missouri, a computer helps fire fighters. The computer, which works very fast, has information about all the 350,000 street addresses in the city. Within two or three seconds after a call is received, the computer provides necessary information for the fire fighters. The information is then sent to them by radio from the computer centre in the City Hall. The exact place of the burning building and its size, type and any other details are clear to them. TheKansas Citycomputer system also has a medical record of each of the city's 900 fire fighters. This kind of information is especially useful when a fire fighter is injured. With the information, doctors at hospital can treat the injured fire fighters more quickly and easily. The fire fighters themselves greatly appreciate the computer's help. They know about possible danger ahead of them and can prepare for it. Many times the computer information helps to save lives and property . Sometimes the lives are those of fire fighters themselves.

Francis Chan, an engineer, lives in Hampstead, north London, in a flat that's just 4ft wide by 21ft long. He loves it. Tiny though it is, it has got all the comforts. Peter Baynes, Chan's architect ,has achieved a clever piece of design, according to architectural experts. The Chan mini-house was built on what was once a path down the side of a big Victarian house. Not an inch of space is wasted. When you step in through the front door, you're standing in the shower, on Britain' s only self-cleansing doormat . A door opens on to an equally tiny toilet with washbasin. Two steps further in comes the kitchen, complete with full-sized cooker and fridge, and washer/ drier. A worktop folds down from the wall. Another step and you're into the dining/ office area. Four people can sit here for dinner, says Chan as he sets the table-top into place. He even has a fold-down drawing-board for when he's working at home.

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"As the nights get lounger, those who suffer from the winter blues will be planning ways to escape to the sunshine. But there may be a much simpler way of cheering yourself up... simply shining a bright light into your ear canal. Up to one in four Britons suffer from seasonal affective disorder, with seven per cent of the population having full-blown SAD. It is caused by the brain not receiving enough daylight which is needed to trigger serotonin , a hormone that regulates mood. Symptoms range from mild lethargy to depression and insomnia, but a cure might be in sight. Two clinical trials, run by Valkee - who make a device that can shine light into your ear - and the University of Oulu in Finland, have found that carefully targeted light can help prevent the condition. Juuso Nissila, Valkee's co-founder and chief scientist said: ""We presented earlier that the human brain is sensitive to light"". ""These two clinical trials demonstrate that channeling bright light via ear canal into brain's photosensitive areas effectively prevents and treats seasonal affective disorder."" The University of Oulu reported that in their first study, 92 per cent of the patients with seasonal affective disorder achieved full remission after a month of daily eight-to-12 minute doses of light from the Valkee. Time Takala, chief physician at the Oulu Deaconess Institute said: ""These two trials show that bright light channeled into the brain via ear canal is an important future method to treat seasonal affective disorder."" Valkee launched its bright light headset in August 2010. It is classed as a medical device under EU regulations. The device channels bright light direct to the brain via the ear canal to prevent and cure depression, mood swings and even circadian-rhythm disorders such as jet lag. It costs PS185 and looks like an iPod - only the earphones emit light rather than sound."	['The bright-light headset will be mainly used to cure jet lag.']
Which of the following could be the best title for the text?	"Monitoring the mood of a pet dog could be used as an early warning sign that an elderly owner is struggling to cope, a new report has claimed. Researchers placed movement sensors on dogs to track their behaviour and identified 17 distinct activities, including chewing, barking, sitting and digging. This allowed them to map the normal behaviour of a healthy, happy dog, which means any changes can be monitored and could indicate an issue with their owner. Nils Hammerla, part of the team from Newcastle University, said, ""Humans and dogs have lived together in close relationships for thousands of years, which has led to strong emotional and social mutual bonds."" ""A dog's physical and emotional dependence on their owner means that their well-being is likely to reflect that of their owner. Any changes such as the dog being walked less often, perhaps not being fed regularly, or simply demonstrating ""unhappy"" behaviour could be an early indicator for families that an older relative needs help. This is the first system of its kind which allows us to remotely monitor a dog's behaviour in its natural setting."" The team of academics, who presented their findings at the 2013 UbiComp conference in Zurich, created a hi-tech, waterproof dog collar for the study. Dr Cas Ladha, who led the study, said: ""A lot of our research is focused on developing intelligent systems that can help older people to live independently for longer. But developing a system that _ family and carers that an older relative is well without intruding on the individual's privacy is difficult. This is just the first step but the idea behind this research is that it would allow us to support people without the need for cameras."" A range of dogs was used for the study, as the team needed to map distinct behaviours that correlated between different breeds."	"[""Dogs' mood can be an indicator of owners' health""]"
We can infer that free radicals_.	"People who eat chocolate regularly tend to be thinner, new research suggests. The findings come from a study of nearly 1,000 US people that looked at diet, calorie intake and body mass index(BMI)----a measure of obesity. It found those who ate chocolate a few times a week were, on average, slimmer than those who ate it occasionally. Even though chocolate is loaded with calories, it contains ingredients that may favour weight loss rather than fat synthesis , scientists believe. Despite boosting calorie intake, regular chocolate consumption was related to lower BMI in the study. The link remained even when other factors, like how much exercise individuals did, were taken into account. And it appears it is how often you eat chocolate that is important, rather than how much of it you eat. The study found no link with quantity consumed. Lead author Dr. Beatrice Golomb, from the University of California at San Diego, said, ""Our findings appear to add to a body of information suggesting that the composition of calories, not just the number of them, matters for determining their ultimate impact on weight."" This is not the first time scientists have suggested that chocolate may be healthy for us. Other studies have claimed chocolate may be good for the heart. Consumption of certain types of chocolate has been linked to some favourable changes in blood pressure and insulin sensitivity. And chocolate does contain antioxidants which can help to absorb free radicals----unstable chemicals that can damage our cells. Mice fed for 15 days with epicatechin (present in chocolate) had improved exercise performance and observable changes to their muscle composition. They say clinical trials are now needed in humans to see if this is the case. But before you reach for a chocolate bar, there are still lots of unanswered questions. And in the absence of conclusive evidence, experts advise caution. While there's no harm in allowing yourself a treat like chocolate now and then, eating too much might be harmful because it often contains a lot of sugar and fat too."	['are harmful to our health']
Which of the following statements is TRUE?	"I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with some financial expressions used in business and the stock market. Our first expression is ""in the red."" It is another way of saying that a business is losing money. In the past, numbers in the financial records of a company were written in red ink to show a loss. A business magazine recently published a report about a television company. The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before. A profit by a business is written in black numbers. So a company that is ""in the black"" is making money. Another financial expression is ""run on the bank."" That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank. A ""run on the bank"" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close. Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression. They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks. ""Day trading"" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system. It was the first completely computerized stock market. It sells stocks of companies not listed on any stock exchange. Many high technology companies are listed on it. Day trading companies provide a desk and a computer system to an investor who wants to trade. Individuals must provide fifty thousand dollars or more to the trading company to pay for the stocks they buy. Thousands of other investors do day trading from computers in their homes. A day trader watches stock prices carefully. When he sees a stock rise in price, he uses the computer to buy shares of the stock. If the stock continues to rise in price in the next few minutes, the day trader sells the shares quickly to make a small profit. Then he looks for another stock to buy. If a stock goes down instead of up, he sells it and accepts the loss. The idea is to make a small profit many times during the day. Day traders may buy and sell stocks hundreds of times each day."

We learn from the text that _ .	Michelle was a student at University of California, Los Angeles. She is here to tell us how she feels about the city. What were the best things about Los Angeles? One of my favorite things about Los Angeles is the weather. I hate the cold and it never really gets that cold there. Plus, most of the time it's usually sunny, which is good because I love going to the beach during the summer. There's so much to do at the beach, but my favorite thing in L.A. was having a picnic on the sand with my friends. What were the worst things about being there? I disliked having to drive everywhere to get around because the city is so spread out. Los Angeles has a lot of traffic and sometimes it takes a long time to get somewhere close by just because the streets are so crowded. Also, a lot of people complain about the pollution. Did you have any problems there? Just the normal problems of living in any city, like watching out for pickpockets . Some people think Los Angeles has a lot of crime, but I think it's as safe as any other city. Also, many people think driving is difficult because there is a lot of traffic and road rage , but it just takes a little practice and a lot of patience. What are the people like in Los Angeles? There are all types of people in Los Angeles since the city is pretty diverse. For the most part, though, most of the people are friendly, calm and relaxed. Some people say that everyone in Los Angeles is beautiful, but I think that's just a stereotype . Would you go back to Los Angeles? Certainly. Los Angeles is one of my favorite cities in the world. I love the fact that it has all the nightlife and shopping of a big city, but also has access to beaches, parks, mountains and other places you can't usually find in large cities. Between the weather and the beaches and all the fun things to do, it's a great place to be.	['Michelle loved the life in Los Angeles']
When learning the grammar of a foreign language, you should _ .	Learning a foreign language is difficult for many learners. The following tips may help you learn a foreign language quickly. Reading aloud When you start learning a foreign language, you should read aloud. Reading aloud instead of reading lowly only to yourself helps you in remembering. It helps with pronunciation, too.

Why should we consider such things as age and background when making friends?	"Friends play an important part in our lives, and although we may take the fact of friendship for granted, we often don't clearly understand how we make friends. While we get on well with a number of people, we are usually friends with only a very few. For example, the average among students is about 6 per person. In the beginning, it much depends on how people meet, and on good first impressions. As we get to know people, we consider things like age, race, looks, economic and social status, and intelligence. Although these factors are not of the greatest importance, it is more difficult to have a good relationship with people when there is a big difference in age and background. We pay attention to actual behavior, facial expression, and the way a person speaks. Friends will stand closer together and soft voices also express friendliness, and it is because they may give the wrong signals that shy people often have difficulty in making friends. A friendly look with the wrong facial expression can turn into an unfriendly stare, and nervousness may be wrongly understood as unfriendliness. Some relationships are a result of argument and discussion, but it is usual for close friends to have the same ideas and beliefs, the same opinions and interests -- they often talk about ""being on the same wavelength"". The more closely involved people become, the more they depend on one another. People want to do friends favors and hate to let them down. Equally, friends have to learn to make allowances for each other, to put up with annoying habits, and to accept differences in opinion. In contrast with marriage, there are no friendship ceremonies to strengthen the relationship between two people. But the mutual support and understanding that results from shared experiences and emotions does seem to create a close and lasting relationship, which can overcome differences in background, and break down barriers of age, class or race."	['Because differences in age and background make it difficult to make friends.']
Which of the following statements is TRUE?	"I am Sergey Brin! I was born in Moscow. In 1979, when I was 5, my family immigrated to the United States. I remember that on my 9th birthday I got my first computer ""Commodore 64"". Later I graduated with honors in the University of Maryland in Mathematics and IT. The main field of my science research was the technologies used to collect data from unsystematic sources as well as large quantities of texts and science data. I was the author of dozens of articles in leading American academic magazines. The greatest event in my life happened when in 1998 I was preparing for the defense of my Doctor's degree in Stanford University. There the fate made me meet Larry Page--a young computer genius. Larry belonged to the intellectual society. Larry and I quickly became friends when we worked together. We were searching day and night on the Internet. We were finding a lot of information but with the feeling we still couldn't find enough of what we were looking for. Naturally the idea for a search engine that would allow specific information to be found in the endless pool of data was born like it came to us. It wasn't our plans but we gave up the education at the university. You know the next part, maybe we managed to turn an ordinary garage in Meplo Park, California, the U. S. A. into our first office, in which Google was born. With excitement we typed the name of the thing which we created with love on September 14th 1998--www. google.com.

I'm writing this letter because I want to let you know that the school year with you was important and special to me. It made a great contribution to my life. I know I was very quiet in your class, and you never said much to me. But you did something that made a big difference in my life. You see, all through my first years in schools. I hated to read. Books were just words that had very little to do with me, and I was bored by them. I'll never forget the first day of Grade Six when you took out a thick book and began to read the story to our class. Your voice seemed to change with the people in the story, and you drew pictures in my mind as you read aloud. Since that day, I couldn't wait until after lunch when you would read to the class. You read us all kinds of wonderful books. During the summer after my year in your class, I missed hearing the stories you would read. So one day I picked up a book and read it all on my own. I found out that I could make the words interesting, too. Now, I love to read! Thank you for opening the world of books for me. Yours, Linda	['The teacher often said much to Linda.']
The best title for the passage is _ .	"Some people make art with paint, and others use pencil or clay. But Italian artist Maurizio Savini prefers to use bright pink gum--after it has been chewed. Savini makes huge sculptures of bears and even people out of used chewing gum. Each sculpture requires thousands of pieces of gum. ""I like to use chewing gum because it seemed to me a material that can be used in many ways compared with those used by the conventional arts such as painting,"" Savini says. How does he do it? The process is a lot like working with clay. ""I work the chewing gum when it is warm and shape it with a knife,"" says Savini. Then, he puts a chemical onto each gum sculpture to make the gum stay in place. Savini's sticky art has been shown in cities like London, Paris, and Rome, where he lives today. Savini isn't the only artist to work with gum. His pink sculptures have inspired artists all over the world to get creative with the sticky matter. London artist Ben Wilson paints small paintings onto flat pieces of chewed gum he finds stuck to streets and sidewalks. In Canada, Jason Kronenwald uses different colored gum to make portraits of famous people. Kronenwald seldom chews gum himself. Instead, his friends help chew gum for him while he's working. ""At times it can make me _ , but I just pay attention to the colors I need and get the sculpture going,"" he says. In America, Jamie Marraccini's art depends on color, so he tests different kinds of gum before using them. To find out what color the chewed gum will become once hardened, he lets it age for up to six months. ""I've created 30 works totaling more than 35,000 pieces of gum,"" says Marraccini. That's a lot of gum! So think twice the next time you throw away a wad of gum. Maybe what seems like trash could actually be the beginning of a great piece of art."	['Sticky sculptures']

What might be the most suitable title for the passage?	When I was a boy I always wanted to be a cowboy. I remember my Mom worrying about me getting sick from the heat in the summer, because I wore a thick blue sweater all the time. No respectable cowboy, however, would wear short sleeves so I sweated while I played. One day my parents gave me a bb gun. It looked just like a gun that all the cowboys used in the movies. I spent hours each day during those summer months shooting at stumps and pretending to be John Wayne (film actor who played tough heroes). As I was coming into the house one afternoon, though, I tried it one time too many. The gun that I thought was empty let out a soft pop and a bullet flew across the room and parted the hair of my Dad who was asleep on the couch. My Dad took one look at the bb hole a half inch above his head, walked over to me, took my gun, walked outside, and calmly broke it in half. I didn't cry too much over this. I knew how close I had come to hurting my Dad with my stupidity. I didn't expect to ever get another bb gun either. That is why I was so surprised when my Dad bought me another one the next year. I guess he thought I had wised up enough to know how to use it this time. I never put a single bb in the new gun, but in my imagination John Wayne rode again. I eventually outgrew my cowboy stage, but I never did outgrow my appreciation for my Father's forgiveness. He showed me that even when I messed up in the worse way I was still loved. He gave me another chance and let me know that I was forgiven whether I deserved it or not. He shared with me some of the unconditional love and forgiveness. May we always embrace and share that love and forgiveness as well.	"[""A Father's forgiveness""]"
Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	"Children are hooked on computers. Some spend up to six hours a day on their gadgets. They can be playing games live with others elsewhere in the world, updating their status on social media, texting friends or looking for the latest app to download to their tablets or smart phones. This worried Martin Strott, headmaster of the Old Hall School in Wellington, in the west of England. He was so concerned that he challenged his students to take part in a week of 'digital detox'. Strott told the local newspaper, the Shropshire Star, that he encourages the pupils to have a good knowledge of the computer from a young age, but is concerned that too much screen time will affect the development of their social skills. He said that this over-reliance on digital devices ""erodes family time and they're missing out on messages from body language and facial expressions from those around them"". According to the headmaster, the parents are happy with the movement. But what about the children? Nine-year-old Fred usually spends around two hours on his gadgets at home after school and around 12 hours on weekends. For him, the digital detox experience was ""really hard"". Fred spent it playing outside, especially basketball. He said that he'll probably engage in different activities from now on but he did miss his phone and online games. The idea of keeping children away from their tech for a while to prevent 'addiction' is not particularly new. There have been similar movements in the US. But are they effective in the long run? Well, even if kids go back to their gadgets, the hope is that at least they'll think about how they use their time. What about you: do you spend too many hours hooked on your digital devices?"

When she was told that she could visit Uncle David, the author felt _ .	"When I was 12 years old, I was at a very hard stage in life. I was short and fat, which was bad for a girl, so coordination was not one of my strongest features. On the other hand, my mother was a very talented softball player who even acted as my coach. Night after night, I would try my best to impress ""my coach"".Unfortunately, I just felt like a terrible disappointment to my mother. One summer afternoon, my mother told us we were going to visit Uncle David. Since we lived in an apartment, going to the country was quite a treat. My uncle David always had a way of making me feel special. When we arrived, my uncle and cousin Jeff were throwing metal rings at two holes in the ground. I was curious about what they were doing so I went over to watch. Noticing that I was standing there, my uncle asked if I had ever played washers. Being a ""city girl"", my reply was that the only ""washers"" I knew were the ones that cleaned clothes. To my embarrassment, Uncle David, chuckling ,explained that the metal rings were called washers. I was shocked to hear my uncle saying he wanted me to take his place. He then gave me the washers and gave tips on how to throw better. Unwillingly, I joined Jeff. Gradually, I found myself not only enjoying but also wanting to win this game. The washer went into the air and began to fall. Then a cloud of dust appeared as the washer sank into the hole. My first try! I had actually thrown the washer into the hole! Although 23 summers have gone by since that day, this small success in washer playing helped me get back self confidence lost when I struggled with the game of softball."	['pleased']
In what way is Guardian Eye most useful to kids?	The new world of today introduced new threats that were not known in the previous generations: Internet predators . Often we do a lot of our researching, shopping, talking; just about everything online nowadays. New advancements in revolution comes along with the unwanted attackers. There are people out there who gain pleasure from, interrupting and taking from our peaceful lives what's not rightfully theirs. But like with everything, there are indeed counteractive measures that can be set in place to fend off these predators from such damage. I'd like to introduce the Guardian Eye. Within this program is a complex program which has several functions to create a safe atmosphere for whomever uses the computer, It has the ability to track and log every key stroke, every website that has ever been accessed, takes screenshots of web pages, blocks web pages according to content and even sends you messages via email once conspicuous activity has been reported and logged. Just think, you or child could be browsing and searching through the Internet and inappropriate content pops up with several different windows. You try to click out of the windows but you accidentally click one which releases spyware, infecting your computer. Guardian Eye blocks unwanted content from popping up or appearing to the users, which I thought was extremely convenient. In this way there is not even the slightest temptation. This product helps prevent damage from being done to your computer and worse, your identity. It's quite the product and it offers a little version so you may try it out first. If you'd like the full package, it's a once time fee 39.99 and can be installed on unlimited computers for your convenience. It's a nice deal and I'm considering getting it again considering I do a lot of writing on various websites myself.	['It keeps them from seeing unwanted contents.']
What do telemarketers do?	"Phones make our lives easier. Usually they are a convenient type of technology to have around because they can help us communicate with all types of people for any reason whatsoever. As long as somebody else has a phone, you can contact them. This means you can keep in touch with friends and family, contact businesses, and generally communicate with people no matter where they are. Sometimes, however, phones can cause problems or be an annoyance. One phenomenon that is dreaded in the United States is telemarketing. Telemarketers call your phone in order to try and convince you to buy their products. They often start the conversation with a friendly voice or tone to try and convince you they can be trusted. Once most people realize they are talking to a telemarketer, they will end the conversation as quickly as possible. Some will be polite and make up an excuse to end the conversation. Others are less tactful and criticize the telemarketer, yell at them, or simply hang up the phone. Although most people don't buy things from telemarketers, a few people do, so telemarketers keep on calling. If you have a phone in America you most likely have received a call from a telemarketer. To avoid telemarketers some people buy new technology. ""Caller ID"" allows you to see the number that is calling your phone before you answer. If you do not recognize the name and number of a caller you can simply ignore the call. Unfortunately there usually is no way to tell if an unknown number is somebody important, but unknown, or a telemarketer. Even though technology can help some people eschew annoying telemarketers, they can't be avoided altogether."	['Attempt to sell products to the people they call.']
Jeans became popular among the teenagers because _ .	"Levi Strauss, who was born in 1830 and went to the USA at the age of 17, sat in the saloon and drank his beer slowly. He began to think. Business was not good. Nobody wanted to buy anything. He thought about the canvas and the pots and pans on the wagon. Then he remembered the hole in Hank's trousers. Suddenly, he had an idea -- ""pants"", he jumped up and shouted, ""Everyone needs pants."" He hurried to a tailor and gave him all his canvas. ""I want you to make pants with this canvas,"" he said. ""Can you do that?"" ""Yes, of course,"" said the tailor, ""What name is it?"" ""Strauss, Levi Strauss."" It was the beginning of jeans. Now more than a hundred years later, people wear jeans all over the world and everyone knows the name of Levi Strauss. In the 1860s, farmers, rail-road workers, cowboys and miners helped to develop the new land. Life was hard. They worked for long hours in all kinds of weather. They wore trousers made by Levi Strauss. They were the first people to wear jeans in America. Jeans first came to Europe with the American soldiers during World War II. Soon, workers in Europe were wearing them. Workers liked them: they were cheap, hardwearing and practical. They were not popular with young people generally until the late 1950s and early 1960s. It came suddenly. It started in America and it crossed the Atlantic quickly. It was a new kind of music, a new kind of dance. Rock' n Roll. The king of Rock' n Roll was Elvis Presley. Teenagers loved him. At home he wore a T shirt, an old leather jacket and blue jeans, so more and more teenagers began to wear jeans. They liked them tight."	['their idol liked wearing them']
If you are going to take examination, _ .	A good way to pass an examination is to work hard every day in the year. You may fail in the examination if you are lazy for most of the year and then work hard only a few days before the examination. If you are taking an English examination, don't learn only rules of grammar. Try to read stories in English and speak in English whenever you can.

In which country is the forest industry the biggest industry?	Paper was not made in southern Europe until the year of 1100.Thouth Scandinavia now makes a great deal of the world's paper, it had not begun to make it until 1500. It was a German named Schaeffer who found out that one could make paper from wood. After that, forest countries, such as Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the United States, became important in paper making. Today in Finland, for example, no industry is bigger than the forest industry. And the paper industry is the most important part of it. Modern paper-making machines are very big, and they make paper very fast. The biggest machines can make a piece of paper 750 meters long and six meters wide in one minute. When we think of paper, we think of newspapers, books, letters, envelopes , and writing paper. But there are many other uses. Each year, more and more things are made of paper. We have had paper cups, plates, and dishes for a long time. But now we hear that chairs, a tables and even beds can be made of paper. The newest thing made of paper in the world may be a paper house. It is not a small house for children to play in, but a real, big house for people to live in. it is not expensive. You can put up a paper house yourself in a few hours, and you can use it for about 5 years. ,.	['Finland.']
If a child plays with his invisible friend, it shows that _ .	Children, especially at young ages, are very creative. And creativity can be a glorious thing. Look at all the amazing artists and architects that have created glorious pieces of history. Look at all the authors with the award winning books. Now I am not saying everyone is going to end up this way but creativity is an important part of growing up and becoming who you are. This should be encouraged in young children as well as the older children. Young children grow up playing with make-believe. And so many people try to make their young child see that their invisible friend isn't real or that talking when someone is not in the room is _ . To adults it is, but for small children it is them being creative. May it be them playing house, or chef, or playing with stuffed animals, it is their creative part coming out. Some kids can have fun playing with rocks and sticks and it's because of their creativeness that they can do this. The invisible friend part is another part of being imaginative, and is not a bad thing since they will grow out of that phase. So encourage this and play along with them, play house or stuffed animals or whatever they want to play. Help keep their imagination running. You can even make up games, like treasure hunts, dinosaurs, or super heroes; there is just so much you can choose from. For older children, talk to them. Help them see things through others' eyes, or help them see things from a different point of view. Helping children see things from other views helps them keep their minds open for new ideas and new things. All this can help your children's minds stay creative. The arts and music, even thoughts are an important part of life and important in our society. If we didn't have and encourage creative thinking, we wouldn't have had inventors, or philosophers, or as I said before, artists.	['the child has great imagination']
Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?	Sitting on the peaceful coast of Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, watching the sun move quietly into the sea, you shouldn't forget that Charles Darwin (1809-1882) arrived here in 1835. He stayed on the islands for five weeks, observing various animals. This finally inspired his famous work,On the Origin of Species. You can certainly follow Darwin's footsteps and enjoy a trip from four to seven days to the islands. The islands are certainly a paradise for wildlife, as there are no natural killers on the islands and the number of boats and visitors is under government control. Though you cannot walk freely as Darwin did about 200 years ago, each day is as impressive as it could be. The most well-known animals of the Galapagos is the giant tortoise , which can be seen moving slowly around the highlands of Santa Cruz, the second largest island in the archipelago . Some of these creatures are so old that they might have been seen in their youth by Darwin himself. Despite strict control over activities and timing, your stay on the Galapagos will be remembered as a chain of incomparable pictures: diving with sea lions that swim and play within inches of you; feeling small sharks touch your feet as you swim; and, most magically, seeing a whale and her baby surface with a great breath of air. Travelling between the islands and observing the wildlife that so inspired Darwin, you will feel as though you are getting a special view of an untouched world. At night you will sleep on board the ship, leaving the wildlife in complete occupation of the islands, which are as undisturbed now as they have been since the beginning of time.

According to Bob Beeton, _ .	"Australia's koalas could die out within 30 years unless immediate action is taken to stop the losing in population, according to researchers. They say development, climate change and bushfires have all combined to reduce the number of wild koalas sharply. The Australian Koala Foundation said a recent survey showed the population could have dropped by more than half in the past six years. The number of koalas was once estimated to be more than 100,000, but now is as few as 43,000. The foundation collected field data from 1,800 sites and 80,000 trees to calculate the numbers. In one area in northern Queensland estimated to have 20,000 koalas a decade ago, a team of eight people could not find a single animal in four days of searching. The foundation said besides problems caused by cutting down forests, hotter and drier conditions because of global warming had reduced the nutritional value of their main food, eucalyptus leaves, leading to poor nutrition for them. Koalas, which live in the forests in Australia's east and south, are very picky about what types of the leaves they eat. Foundation chief Deborah Tabart said: ""The koalas are missing everywhere we look. It's really no tree, no me. If you keep cutting down trees you don't have any koalas.""She is hoping the new figures will persuade the government's Threatened Species Steering Committee (TSSC) to list the koala as threatened. But committee chairman Bob Beeton said a decision was not likely recently and the koala's status as one of the country's favorite animals would not be a factor. ""There's a number of species which are attractive and people have special feelings towards them. We don't consider that,"" Mr Beeton said."	"[""they needn't pay special attention to koalas""]"

What's the best title of the passage?	The phenomenon is becoming more and more popular that human beings have developed a closely relationship with the most dangerous of animals-Kevin Richardson treats lions like kitty cats,Andre Hartman has a special bond with Great White Sharks and now there is 79year old Werner Freund who has spent the last 40 years of his life in the company of wolves. While details about how and why the former paratrooper became attached to these beautiful wild animals are a little summary,he has been tending them in his 25acre Wolvespark located in the German province of Saarland,since 1972.While he currently has a group of 29,over the years he has raised almost 70 wolves belonging to all breeds ranging from Siberian to Arctic,Canadian,European and even,Mongolian.The wolves treat Werner as if he were one of their own.They nuzzle against him,play with him and are generally sheeplike when he is around,just like they would be around a head wolf! This,however,is not accidental-It is a position that Werner works on establishing and maintaining with a simple act,every single day-Whenever it's feeding time,he calls his wolves to come for the raw meat by howling.As the hungry animals rush to get their food,they are always met with this scene-Werner sinking his teeth into the raw meat first.While this may sound a little rude,that is how the position of hierarchy is established in the animal world.It is always the leader male that gets the first meal and only when he signals,can the rest join in.Werner's wolves know this rule quite well and never challenge his authority. While wolves,the largest member of the dog family,are believed to be dangerous,they rarely attack humans.Werner says that in reality,they are beautiful gentle souls,whose reputation has been tarnished,by fairy tales like Red Riding Hood!

The author mentions all the following EXCEPT _ .	"BERLIN -- With the crisis in Japan raising fears about nuclear power, Germany and Switzerland said on Monday that they would reassess the safety of their own reactors. Doris Leuthard, the Swiss energy minister, said Switzerland would put off plans to build nuclear plants. She said no new ones would be permitted until experts had reviewed safety standards. Germany will put off ""the recently decided extension of the running time of German nuclear plants,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. ""This moratorium will run for three months and it will allow for a thorough examination of the safety standards of the county's 17 nuclear power plants. The European Union called for a meeting on Tuesday of nuclear safety authorities to assess Europe's preparedness. Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, called for a new risk analysis of the country's nuclear plants, particularly regarding their cooling systems. He is the leader of the Free Democratic Party, which strongly supports nuclear power. A previous government, led by the Social Democrats, passed a law in 2001 to close all the country's nuclear plants by 2021. But Mrs. Merkel's government changed that decision last year to extend the lives of the plants by an average of 12 years. In Switzerland, Doris Leuthard said she had already asked to analyze the exact cause of the problems in Japan and draw up new or tougher safety standards ""particularly in terms of seismic safety and cooling."" In Russia, the Prime Minister said his government would ""draw conclusions from what's going on in Japan."""	['The Social Democrats in Germany shares the same view with the Free Democratic Party.']
At present Santa Fe belongs to _ .	Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico, U.S.A.,is in the central part of the state, on the Santa Fe River, which flows into the Rio Grande 35 kilometres west of the city. More than two thousand metres above sea level, it lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains with the Ortiz Mountains to the southeast. Santa Fe was founded in 1609 by the Spanish on an old Indian village.In 1680 the Indians seized the place but only held it for twelve years before the Spanish retook it. The city remained under Spanish rule until Mexico won its independence in 1821. From then on it was a Mexican city until 1846 when it was taken over by American troops. With a population of 48,953, Santa Fe is now the second largest city in the state. Because of its sunny weather, rich history and surrounding mountains, it is a good place for holiday makers. Besides hunting and skating in the mountains people enjoy shopping in the Indian and Spanish shops, which brings a large income to the city every year.

According to a Chinese newspaper, the best way to deal with the dispute is _ .	"The summer has seen a series of marine disputes involving China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines. This week there were more anti-Japanese riots in cities across China because of a dispute over a group of uninhabited islands known to the Japanese as the Senkakus and to the Chinese as the Diaoyu Islands. One Chinese newspaper has helpfully suggested skipping the pointless diplomacy and moving straight to the main course by serving up Japan with an atom bomb. The government in Beijing is trying to play down the dispute, aware of the economic interests in keeping the peace. China is re-emerging after what it sees as 150 years of humiliation, surrounded by anxious neighbours, many of them allied to America. In that context, disputes about _ could become very significant. Whatever the legality of Japan's claim to the islands, its roots lie in empire-building. China's leaders now face sharp criticism if they do not fight their country's corner. A recent poll suggested that over half of China's citizens thought the next few years would see a ""military dispute"" with Japan. The islands matter, therefore, less because of fishing, oil or gas than as counters in the high-stakes game for Asia's future. Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines fear that if they give in, China will sense weakness and prepare the next demand. China fears that if it fails to press its case, America and others will conclude that they are free to scheme against it. Asia's inability to deal with the islands raises doubts about how it would cope with a genuine crisis, on the Korean peninsula, say, or across the Strait of Taiwan. And the tendency for the slightest quarrel to turn into a full-blown conflict presents problems for America, which both aims to reassure China that it welcomes its rise, and also uses the threat of military force to guarantee that the Pacific is worthy of the name."

What can we learn from the text?	"Archaeologists believe they are on the turning point of throwing light on the life of William Shakespeare -- by excavating what may have been the playwright's dust hole. Experts have begun excavating the ruins of New Place, Shakespeare's former home in Stratford-upon-Avon, which was destroyed 250 years ago. Although little remains of the property, the team, led by Birmingham Archaeology, believes it has identified a dust hole used by the 16th century poet. Small pieces of pottery and broken clay pipe have already been found from a muddy hole on the site, which they claim could yield some of the most significant discoveries about Shakespeare in decades. The dig focuses on three areas of the property, which Shakespeare bought in 1597 when he returned to his home town from London having achieved fame -- including the so-called knot garden at the back of the building. Dr Diana Owen, Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which owns the site, said, ""We do not know if the knot garden was an area used by Shakespeare -- it may have been a yard simply used by his servants. But this could actually yield some fantastic results, especially if it was an area where rubbish was thrown or the dust hole was located."" Kevin Colls, from Birmingham Archaeology,added, ""Through documentary evidence we know Shakespeare lived at New Place but we have very little information regarding the layout of the house and gardens at this time. Through archaeological fieldwork, in particular the dig of structural remains and the recovery of artifacts, we hope to fill in the blanks."" Until October, visitors will be able to watch archaeologists and volunteers at work as they excavate the remains of the house, which was knocked down in 1759. Experts hope to unearth evidence to support theories that Shakespeare wrote many of his most famous works at the property."	['Shakespeare used to live at New Place.']

What can we infer from the passage?	For hundreds of years, textbooks have put a world of knowledge in the hands of students. Paper textbooks are expensive to produce and expensive for schools to buy. Nowadays information changes so quickly that some textbooks are out of date almost before they're published. And as books are passed along from one student to the next, they get more highlighted, dog-eared, tattered, and worn. It's no secret that paper textbooks are heavy. But what you may not know is that backpack weight is an increasing problem among kids. Studies show that heavy backpacks can lead to both chronic back pain and poor posture -- and many kids are carrying a quarter of their body weight in textbooks. Today's students have grown up completely immersed in technology. iPod, iPad, computer -- these are the ways they interact with their world. They need a textbook made for the way they learn. iBooks textbooks on iPad offer a gorgeous, full-screen experience full of interactive diagrams, photos, and videos. No longer limited to static pictures to illustrate the text, now students can dive into an image with interactive captions, rotate a 3D object, or have the answer spring to life in a chapter review. They can flip through a book by simply sliding a finger along the bottom of the screen. Highlighting text, taking notes, searching for content, and finding definitions in the glossary are just as easy. And with all their books on a single iPad, students will have no problem carrying them wherever they go. McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt -- the publishers responsible for the majority of K-12 content in the US -- have created Multi-Touch textbooks available now from the iBookstore	"[""Some things don't get better with age, such as paper textbook.""]"
It can be inferred that bruchids _ .	"Airtight plastic bags can help farmers protect their harvests without the use of harmful chemicals. These bags are designed to keep air out of crops in storage. Using them is a simple way to fight insects and keep crops fresh. Ten countries in West and Central Africa are involved in a project to improve the storage of cowpeas, also known as black-eyed peas. Farmers can lose much of the harvest to insects called bruchids , which grow from egg to adult in a few weeks and then lay forty to sixty eggs. They can destroy the whole harvest within months. Farmers can sell their crops immediately. But selling at harvest time means more competition and lower prices.Or they can use pesticides to kill the bugs. But a crop scientist Dieudonne Baributsa says, ""They end up misusing or overusing the pesticide. In Nigeria, they have reported a lot of cases of death. They usually call cowpeas 'killer beans' in Nigeria."" Mr. Baributsa is a researcher at Purdue University in Indiana, America. The project is called PICS---Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage. He says the storage bags are thick enough that any insects already in the cowpeas willdie from a lack of oxygen. The lack of air will also help prevent the growth of bacteria that can ruin the harvest. The bags cost about two dollars each. Mr. Baributsa says that is not much, especially if it means farmers can wait long enough to get a better price for their crops. The bags are produced locally. Donors currently support the project, but the groups involved are working to build a lasting market for the bags because donation for the project will not lastforever. A company based in the United States called GrainPro makes another kind of airtight bags. These are called SuperGrainbags. Phil Villers, the company's president, says storing a harvest safely not only helps farmers earn more money, but also reduces the amount of the harvest loss to insects, spoilage and mishandling. ""What does not get wasted and eaten means it is possible to feed a hungry world,"" said Phil Villers."	['breed fast.']

What's the main idea of the passage?	Jean is a bright young woman who comes from a rich and famous family. She goes to a good university and has everything that money can buy, well, almost everything. The problem is that the people in Jean's family are so busy that they can hardly find time to be with her. In fact, Jean is quite lonely. So Jean spends a lot of time on her QQ. She likes being anonymous , talking to people who do not know about her famous family and her rich life. She uses the name Linda on QQ and has made a lot of friends who she keeps in touch with quite often. Last year Jean made a very special friend on QQ. His name was David and lived in San Francisco. David was full of stories and jokes. He and Jean had a common interest in rock music and modern dance. So it always took them hours to talk happily on QQ and sometimes they even forgot their time. Of course, they wanted to know more about each other. David sent a picture of himself. He was a tall, good-looking young man with a big happy smile. As time went by, they became good friends and often sent cards and small things to each other. When Jean's father told her that he was going on a business trip to San Francisco, she asked him to let her go with him so that she could give David a surprise for his birthday. She would take him the latest DVD of their own rock singer. But when she knocked on David's door in San Francisco, she found that her special friend was a twelve-year-old boy named Jim.

The exhibition has created debate with some people saying that as fun as video games are ,they are not works of art. Other people say that videos games may be a new form of art and that they belong to in museums. We asked readers for their opinions on the topic. Here are a few of the letters we received. A video game is like a painting on a screen. In order to make a video game, you have to think of something original to reach the players. This is the point of Art. ---Mary Pottanat,13 I believe video games are not a form of art. Art should be a visual and creative expression of feelings. Although it is arguable that video games are visual ,they do not express feelings in any way. ---Prannab Kirshnan,12 However exciting video games are, they are not art. Painting is art, but not video games. Art has beauty and culture that no technology could ever compare to. Even though you can create art in some video games, the "" Mona Lisa"" wasn't painted with Nintendo. ---Caroline Kaplan,10 Art is a way of communicating ideas to the public in a way that is fun to them.

The passage centers on _ .	It remained a question who had to be the pioneer life on a new island. In fact, few people knew it. Thousands of years ago, in the middle of an ocean, miles from the nearest island, an undersea volcano broke out. The hot liquid rock piled higher and higher and spread wider and wider. In this way, an island rose up in the sea. As time went on, hot sun and cool rains made the rock split and break into pieces. Sea waves dashed against the rock. In this way, soil and sand came into being. It is well known that nothing lived on the naked soil. And then the wind and the birds brought plant seeds, spiders and other creatures there. Only plants could grow first. Only they, in sunlight, could produce food from the minerals of the soil, water and air. While many animals landed on the island, they could find no food. A spider spun its web in vain , because there were no insects for its web to catch. Insects could not stay until there were plants for them to eat. So plants had to be the pioneer life on his new island.	['how life began on a volcano-produced island.']
Which invention won an award?	"Have you dreamed of building your own machine? Do you wish you could invent something new? Here we look at a few British inventions of recent times. Adaptable glasses Do you wear glasses? If so, can you imagine life without them? In 1985, Joshua Silver, a professor at Oxford University, asked himself, ""Can I invent a pair of glasses that could be changed by the wearer?"" He designed two plastic lenses that are filled with a special liquid. Using syringes you change the liquid between the lenses until you can see clearly. The glasses are not beautiful but they are easy to use and cheap to make. The wind-up radio When you switch your TV on tonight, think about all those people without electricity. Thinking about this, Trevor Baylis came up with the idea of designing a radio that could be powered by hand. In common with Joshua Silver he wanted his invention to be cheap and easy to use. He wanted even the poorest people in developing countries, who don't have electricity and cannot afford batteries, to use it. The radio has a generator which is powered by turning a handle. In 1996 it won a BBC Design Award for Best Protect and Best Design. The Dyson cleaner In many homes around the world you can see a cleaner that looks like a spaceship. This is the Dyson vacuum cleaner which uses something called ""cyclonic separation"" to separate the dirt. You do not need a bag for your cleaner and it does not get blocked so it is very practical. The idea came to Sir James Dyson after he kept having problems with his vacuum cleaner. He decided he could design a better one and in 1993 he opened his own factory. The Dyson is now one of the best-selling cleaners in the UK and Dyson is believed to have earned over a billion pounds. The Zapata fly-board Ever dreamed of zooming through the water and leaping in the air like a dolphin? Now you can thanks to a fly-board, built by water sports enthusiast Frank Zapata. With it you can dive back in the water and out again. It's possible to jump to incredible heights out of the water -- over 30 feet. The basic fly-board model comes in at PS4,200. So keep dreaming and inventing. One day you might get it right."	['The wind-up radio.']

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it? Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper. Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse. ""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there."" Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works. Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations."" Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back."" Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that."" Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too."	['Our fingers are more sensitive than our eyes.']
We may read this passage _ .	"Going to a friend's house is very exciting. You may spend time with a friend and get to see where he lives. So remember to be polite. When to arrive The first thing to remember is that when a friend invites you, you need to arrive on time. If your friend tells you to come ""about 3:00"", that means you can arrive before 3:05. But usually it is a good idea to arrive at the right time. What to bring Often it is also nice to bring something to your friend's house. This could be a box of chocolates for you two to share, or maybe a movie that you can watch together. You can also bring some flowers. A little gift is a nice way to show your friend that you are excited to be at his house. How to greet When you visit your friend's house, you may also meet his parents. You should tell them who you are and they may tell you their names. As a child, I went to visit my friend Paul. I called his parents by their first names John and Mary. But now I know it is more polite to call them Mr. or Mrs. Smith. This will show them more respect and then they may tell you to call them by their first names. Another way to show respect is to call them Madam or Sir. It is a cool thing to visit a friend's house. Be polite to your friend and your friend's parents, and you will be welcome again!"

Because the Adriatic Sea will cover it, the Venetians _ .	"Venice is the ""Queen"" of the Adriatic Sea . Every year thousands of people from all over the world travel to Italy to visit the city. Do you know why they like to go there for a visit? Venice is a very beautiful city. It is quite different from other cities in the world. There aren't any roads and streets in the city.

They can build some strong huge walls and gates in the sea. The gates will close to keep too much water out. Thus Venice will not sink."	['will try to do something to save their city.']
The bedside lamp light doesn't affect the brain because _ .	"American researchers have discovered that human brains and sleep patterns are confused by devices that give out bright lights. Electronics, such as laptops, mislead our minds into thinking that it is still daytime, preventing sleep and increasing the risk of _ . Sleep experts say human's natural body clock begins to rest and relax from the day between 9 and 10 pm but the use of computers confuses it. A person's brain biologically becomes awake when the sun is out because bright light after dark causes the brain to stop producing the hormone called melatonin that makes us sleepy. Researchers say blue light from devices such as iPads, which is expected to become a popular reading tool when it comes out later this month, is particularly disruptive during the night when the brain thinks it should be dark. Experts say a good book is a far better way of resting the brain and ensuring a good night's sleep because the bedside lamp light doesn't affect the brain as it does not look straight into a person's eyes. ""Potentially, yes, if you're using an iPad or a laptop close to bedtime... that light can be stimulating to the brain to make it more awake and delay your ability to sleep,"" Phyllis Zee, a professor at Northwestern University and director of the school's Centre for Sleep & Circadian Biology, told CNN. ""And I think more importantly, it could also be enough to affect your circadian rhythm. This is the clock in your brain that determines when you sleep and when you wake up.

According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?	Americans like to travel on their yearly holiday. Today, more and more travelers in the United States are spending nights at small houses or inns instead of hotels. They get a room for the night and the breakfast the next morning. Rooms for the night in private homes with breakfast have been popular with travelers in Europe for many years. In the past five to ten years, these bedandbreakfast places have become popular in the United States. Many of these America's bedandbreakfast inns are old historic buildings. Some bedandbreakfast inns have only a few rooms. Others are much larger. Some inns do not provide telephones or televisions in the rooms, others do. Staying at a bedandbreakfast inn is much different from staying at a hotel. Usually the cost is much less. Staying at an inn is almost like visiting someone's home. The owners are glad to tell about the areas and the interesting places to visit. Many vacationists say they enjoy the chance to meet local families.

Why didn't his parents want to bring him up?	Huang Naihui was born in 1964 in Taipei. When he was a child, he had a very high fever, which made him partially paralyzed. His parents were afraid that he would bring bad luck to the family and abandoned him. But his grandmother brought him up. It was at the age of 13 that he went to school. At the age of 22, he would study and work part-time. He would sell flowers during the day and attend classes at night. During his spare time he would study. The learning made him very happy. He used his knowledge very well in his business of selling flowers. He would go door to door selling flowers during the day. He would sell flowers at pubs and night clubs at night. At times, in order to sell, he had to sing. He was often tricked. However, he would face the next customer with a smile. His grandmother passed away when he was 24. It was the darkest day of his life. Today Huang Naihui owns 3 flower shops and employs disabled people to work for him. He would spend his spare time doing charity work.

According to the passage, PSE is a group _ .	"Some young Cambodians are learning a new sport -- skateboarding. The country's first skateboard park is located on the grounds of a local charity group at the edge of Phnom Penh, the capital. Sports like Khmer boxing and soccer are wildly popular in Cambodia. But Chea, who has been skating for 6 months, says skating has already become his favorite sport. The skaters are learning tricks like launching off a jump or half-pipe and flying through the air on their narrow wooden boards. A non-governmental organization called Skateistan Cambodia organizes weekly programs at the park. Skateistan started its work in Afghanistan years ago. Rory Burke is working with the group which expanded to Cambodia last year. Rory Burke points out, ""Yeah, it's definitely not a typical Cambodian pastime . And I think the idea of 'why skateboarding' is that it's not been done before here. We want to use skateboarding as something saying, 'Hey, this is new, this is something different.And that kind of itself becomes _ . People see it and they think and they say, 'Wow, what is that?' and they want to get involved. "" Skateistan partners with local groups that work with young people.

So that is why I skateboard ---to improve my bad feelings. ', He says he began skateboarding more than a year ago. Before he started training, it seemed very easy. But it was very difficult to learn tricks, and he got hurt a lot from falling off. Rory Burke says learning to deal with the difficulties is part of the lesson for these young skateboarders."

According to Jim Rawlins, _ .	"Essay is optional and no penalties for wrong answers. These changes will take place in SAT college exam. The changes include the use of some words more commonly used in school and on the job instead of the words such as ""prevaricator"" and ""sagacious"". College Board officials said the change is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward. The new exam will be rolled out in 2016, so this year's ninth graders will be the first to take it, in their junior year. The new SAT will continue to test reading, writing and math skills, with an emphasis on analysis. Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004, with a separate score for the optional essay. For the first time, students will have the option of taking the test on computers. They also said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of SAT words currently can ask for help: practicing with flashcards. They know flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts, but when the SAT rolls around they become the royal road. Students stop reading and start flipping. The essay will be changed in other ways, too. It will measure students' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument and it will also be up to colleges whether the essay will be required. Each exam will include a passage drawn from ""founding documents"": such as the Declaration of Independence or from discussions they've inspired. Instead of testing a wide range of math concepts, the new exam will focus on a few areas, like algebra, thought to be most needed for college and life afterward. A calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions, instead of on the entire math portion . Jim Rawlins, the director of admissions at the University of Oregon, said the changes will potentially help the students but it will take a few years to know its influence, after the students go on to college. He said some colleges are still dealing with questions about the changes made in 2005, such as how to consider the essay portion. The criticism of the SAT is that students from wealthier families do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes. The SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students. It has historically been more popular on the coasts, while the other main standardized college entrance exam, the ACT, dominated the central U.S. The ACT took over the SAT in total use in 2012, partly because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of those states' testing scheme . ACT president Jon Erickson said when hearing of the SAT changes, his reaction was that they could've been talking about the ACT now. ""I didn't hear anything new and different, so I was a little left wanting, at least at the end of this first announcement,"" Erickson said . Bob Schaeffer, education director at the National Center for Fair & Open Testing, or FairTest, said it is laudable that the SAT will provide free test preparation, but it is unlikely to make a dent in the market for such preparation. He also said the new test is unlikely to be better than the current one. His organization has a database with institutions that don't require ACT or SAT scores to make admissions decisions."

According to the author,while spending Labor Day,Americans should feel _ .	To many Americans,Labor Day marks the end of the summer,a day off from work and school,and one last chance to relax.But Labor Day is much more than just a day off . It represents a very important victory for laborers everywhere.The holiday is a celebration of the social and economic achievements of American workers. More than a century ago workers were forced to deal with harsh conditions.They were paid very little and they often worked 10-to l2-hour days.Men, women and even small children were forced to work even when they were sick.Tired of long hours and dangerous conditions,workers began organizing themselves into labor unions.On top of fighting for higher pay and shorter workdays,they also fought for the rights of children.The workers wanted employers to place limits on the age of their workers so that small children were not overworked or hurt in factories. A New York City carpenter named Peter McGuire is credited for coming up with the idea for Labor Day.In 1872,after working many hours under poor conditions, McGuire _ 100,000 workers to go on strike.The workers marched through the streets of New York City,demanding a better work environment.McGuire spent a decade fighting for workers' rights.In 1882,he proposed the idea to create a special holiday for workers.On Tuesday,September 5,1882, more than 10,000 workers hit the streets of New York City for the first ever Labor Day parade.Two years later the celebration was moved to the first Monday in September.And in 1894,Congress passed a law making Labor Day a national holiday.Americans celebrated the first Labor Day holiday with a parade,picnics and fireworks. Today,many people hit the road to enjoy the last of their summer vacation.Others enjoy the long weekend with picnics,backyard barbecues or just rest and relaxation.However you spend Labor Day,remember that the holiday is a time to pay tribute to the workers who have made America what it is today.

The writer lives in _	"My sister Alli and I have been trying to get people to stop dropping cigarette butts for seven years. One day, we were walking in our hometown and saw hundreds of cigarette butts on the ground. They made the town look so ugly that we decided to start a group to make people stop dropping butts. We called it ""No Butts About It"". At first, we drew pictures with ""The Earth is Not Your Ashtray "" written on them. We put the pictures around our hometown---in parks, by beaches, and along roads. We wanted to make people understand that dropping butts hurts the environment. Most smokers don't think that dropping butts hurts the earth. But it does! All rubbish does. Later, we wrote to companies and asked them for money to help us. We used the money to buy ashtrays to give smokers. We wanted smokers to carry the ashtrays with them so they didn't have to drop butts. At the moment, we are trying to get cigarette companies to put an ashtray in each pack of cigarettes. Some companies want to do it. Many people have started to join our group since it began. Today there are 45 other ""No Butts About It"" groups in America. And there are even groups in England, Australia and India! Many newspapers have written about my sister and I over the last seven years. And we have won many prizes for our good work. But we are not interested in prizes. We just want to make the earth a better and cleaner place for animals, plants and people. One day it will be."	['America.']

Which of the following statements about the North Star is TRUE?	Even if you're not an astronomy fan, chances are that you can easily recognize certain constellations and stars such as the Big Dipper and the North Star. The North Star is the brightest star in the constellation known as the Little Dipper. It is so-called because of the special position. If you were to stay up all night looking at the stars, you'd slowly see them move around a point in the sky known as the North Celestial Pole. You would notice, however, that one star remains still. This is the North Star, so named for its location almost directly in line with the North Celestial Pole. Due to its position in the sky, at one time sailors used the North Star as a navigational tool. By measuring the angle between the northern horizon and the North Star, a navigator could accurately determine the ship's latitude.[:ZXXK] But latitude, or the imaginary lines stretching across the globe parallel to the equator, was not enough to plot a ship's location. Knowing latitude only allowed navigators to locate themselves on a particular latitude line at a particular distance from the equator. It was only with the invention of a way to accurately measure longitude that precise navigation became possible.

What is the main purpose of the writer?	Dear Mr. Barton, I'm writing in the name of the residents' association to inform you of our feelings regarding your behaviour . We've really had just about enough of you.Although we have tried to speak to you civilly on several occasions,you have always responded with a stream of verbal abuse . Ever since you moved in three months ago,you have shown very little consideration for the other residents of the building,despite numerous complaints.For the past six weekends in a row, you have held extremely noisy parties,which have not finished until the early hours of the morning.It's just not on! As you are aware,most of the people here are old people or have very young children,and the noise keeps them awake all night.You don't have to be so noisy,do you? Last weekend the situation _ further when two of your acquaintances were involved in a fight on the first floor landing.The disturbance was so bad that the police had to be called.What's more,your mates left the stairs in a terrible state--they even broke two windows on their way out! We feel that this type of bad behaviour is unbearable. We strongly recommended that you arrange payment for this damage to the windows,soon.If you don't and you carry on being a nuisance ,we will kick you out! Legal steps will be taken if necessary. Yours sincerely	['To inform Mr. Barton of the noise he made.']
Which of the following can NOT the players experience while playing the new game?	"Ever wondered how one person could save the planet from the effects of climate change? A British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that. ""Fate of the World""puts the Earth's future in players' hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions or let it destroyed by more emissions. Through different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years. An improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year. Created by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists. ""Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,"" Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption's founder and chairman said. This year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public's interest in climate change. However, games centered on sustainability and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness. Using climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing.Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.""We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,""he added."

We can infer that Apple's iBike is _ .	"Maybe you've just invented something better than the iPhone or a solar-powered car. You don't want anyone to steal your design. What should you do? Patent it! Patents are the best way to get credit for your work and help others continue advancing in that field. Here's what you need to know. A patent gives you the right to an invention. The patent protects its owner, which means the invention can't be copied or sold without their agreement. In exchange, the owner must reveal information about the invention. This contributes knowledge that helps other inventors improve on their own research. A patent usually lasts about 20 years. The first step to getting a patent is the application. The person applying must name the invention, explain its use and describe it clearly. The invention must be practical and contain some new characteristic -- something that hasn't been seen or used before. But not everything ""new"" can be patented. Many countries don't allow patents on things like new concepts, scientific theories, medical procedures or substances already found in nature. You may not be able to see patents, but they're connected to nearly everything. There are patents on things you use every day, like plastic, medicine and your computer. There are patents on things that are unavailable on the market, too. Apple is well-known for its patents on potential products, such as the ""iBike"" or the ""iKey"". Of course there are also patents on inventions like this. Take the anti-eating face mask for example. This _ locks around your head with a metal cage covering your mouth. You can breathe and speak, but you can't eat! Although many patented inventions can be failures, there's plenty of room for success. So if you have a cool invention, try to patent it."

In which part can this passage probably be found ?	"Love is a telephone which always keeps silent when you are longing for a call, but rings when you are not ready for it. As a result, we often miss the sweetness from the other end. Love is a telephone which is seldom program-controlled or directly dialed. You cannot get an immediate answer by a mere ""hello"", let alone go deep into your lover's heart by one call. Usually it had to be relayed by an operator, and you have to be patient in waiting. _ Love is a telephone which is always busy, When you are ready to die for love, you only find, to your disappointment, the line is already occupied by someone else, and you are greeted only by a busy line. This is an eternal regret handed down from generation to generation and you are only one of those who languish for(...) followers. Love is telephone, but it is difficult to seize the center time for dialing, and you will let the opportunity slip if your call is either too early or too late. Love is a telephone which is not always associated with happiness. Honeyed words are transmitted by sound waves, but when the lovers are brought together, the phone serves no purpose that many lovers observe that marriage is the _ of love. Love is a telephone which, when you use it for the first time, makes you so nervous and excited that you either hold the receiver upside down or dial the wrong number. By the time you've calmed down, you will beat a loss to whom you should make the call. Love is a telephone which often has crossed lines. And this usually happens to you unexpectedly. Your time will either cross or be crossed. Both cases are referred to as ""triangle"". Fortunately, all such occurrences are transient ."	['emotion']
When Ballard worked at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, he _ .	Robert Ballard was born in 1942. From an early age, he loved the sea. Ballard grew up in Southern California. He spent his free time at the beach near his home. He enjoyed fishing and swimming. He even learned to dive. When Ballard wasn't at the ocean, he loved reading about it. At age 10, he read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, a book which describes the undersea adventures of Captain Nemo. Ballard decided he wanted to be like Captain Nemo when he grew up. His parents helped him follow his dream. Ballard was a hardworking student. He spent many years learning all he could about the ocean. By the age of 28, he was an expert. In 1970, he took a job as a scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. There he studied underwater mountains of the Atlantic Ocean. He came up with ways to predict volcanoes under the oceans. Working with other scientists, Ballard also found previously unknown sea animals. These animals lived far below the ocean's surface, where scientists had believed no animals could live. By the 1980s, Ballard's interests changed. He developed unmanned vehicles to explore the ocean bottom. His first find, the well-known ship Titanic, made Ballard famous. He was not happy with just one big find, however. He looked for -- and found -- other well-known ships. One was the German battleship Bismarck. Another was the U.S. Yorktown, an aircraft carrier that sank during World War II. Today Robert Ballard is still an underwater explorer. He also heads an organization that encourages students to learn about science. Ballard hopes that some of the students will follow in his footsteps. After all, the world's huge oceans are mostly unknown. Who knows what remains to be discovered under the sea?

Who have the same view about using cell phones while driving?	Alejandra Pachecho:No. Why not?That is because in this world some people drive very crazily. So most people who use cell phones to talk in the car usually pay more attention to what they are talking about than to driving. One of the reasons that I feel this way is that my friend had a car accident while using a cell phone. He lost his life and his friends did, too. Rodrigo Cruz:That depends. The advantages of using a cell phone while driving are that you can call the police if there is a car accident, call for help when somebody's car breaks down, and call when somebody needs something before arriving home or at the office. The disadvantage is that people get distracted when they are driving at the same time they are talking on a cell phone. It can cause car accidents. Carl Khalid:No. I would recommend if you want to use a cell phone while you're driving, pull over and take your time. You will avoid a lot of trouble. There are many advantages of using cell phones in cars. In emergencies such as accidents, a flat tire or engine problem, the cell phone is useful for calling 911 for help. Using the cell phone while driving can save time, but using it while driving can also cause a lot of problems such as missing a red light or signs, not watching cars, or not paying attention to the speed limit. It causes a lot of problems. All these problems could cause loss of concentration. Mirna Hazim:Yes. A cell phone is helpful; it is one of the most important communication devices. For example, if you want to talk with somebody for an important reason, you can. One time when I was coming back from work at 10 o'clock at night, I had a problem in my car. It wouldn't move. I was scared to go into a store to call my brother because I didn't know the places there. I thought it could be dangerous. That night I found out that owning a cell phone is important.

The writer suggests that _ .	"The iPhone, the iPad, each of Apple's products sounds cool and has become a fashion. Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter ""i"" -- and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer -- which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -- adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear -- popular in the US and UK -- that plays music and video is called ""iTeddy"". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name ""i"". In general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use. Most ""i"" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's ""i"", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name. But it's hard to see what's so special about the letter ""i"". Why not use ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, ""i"" works because its meaning has become ambiguous. When Apple uses ""i"", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. ""Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,"" he says. ""However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability .""adds Thorne. Clearly the letter ""i"" also agrees with the idea that the Western World is centered on the individual. Each person believes they have their own needs, and we love personalized products for this reason. Along with ""Google"" and ""blog"", readers of BBC Magazines voted ""i"" as one of the top 20 words that have come to define the last decade. But as history shows, people grow tired of fads . From the 1900s to 1990s, products with ""2000"" in their names became fashionable as the year was associated with all things advanced and modern. However, as we entered the new century, the trend eventually disappeared."	"['the popularity of ""i"" products may not last long']"
To make parenting easier, most parents probably _ .	"Most parents of kids under age 8 don't worry about how much time they spend watching TV or using other media, from computers to smart phones to tablets PCs, according to a new survey that found a child's use of media often reflects how much time parents spend in the similar way. We generally found that media use is not a source of conflict in the home"" for families with young children, Ellen Wartella, a researcher from Northwestem University, told USA Today. She led a survey of 2,326 parents who have children 8 and younger.It found that in 80 percent of families, children's media use was not a problem, with 55 percent ""not too"" or"" not at all"" concerned about it. It also showed parents have more positive than negative feelings about how media consumption affects a child's learning and the development of creativity.The exception is video games, which are viewed more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices.""Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's school performance, attention time, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium,"" the researchers said in a news conference about the survey. The findings exposes a generational shift in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,"" said Wartella.""Today's parents grew up with technology as a central pact of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents, instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair. "" The researchers identified three media environments created by parents: media-centric (39 percent of families) , media-moderate (45%)and media-light (16%). Children in media-centric families spend at least three hours more each day watching TV or using computers, video games and tablet PCs don't make parenting easier.And 88 percent of parents say they are most likely to turn to toys or activities to keep their children occupied.Slightly fewer turn to books (79%) and TV(78%). The survey didn't look at how media affects children. That's a topic that the American Academy of Pediatrics has handled a number of times. The AAP says studies have found too much media use can lead to attention- problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders and being fat. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illegal and risky behaviors. By limiting screen time and offering educational media and non-electronic formats such as books, newspapers and board games, and watching television with their children, parents can help guide their children's media experience. Putting questionable content into context and teaching kids a700ut advertising contributes to their media literacy ,"" it says. The pediatricians' group says parents should have ""screen-free zones"" and TV should be turned off during dinner. At most, it recommends children and teens engage with entertainment media for no more than two hours a day and that should be high-quality content. It is important for kids to spend time on outdoor play, reading, hobbies and using their imaginations in free play."" Kids under 2 should not use television and other entertainment media because their brains are developing quickly and they learn best from direct human interaction,"" the group says. An article on screen time by t.he Mayo Clinic also notes problems linked t.o over screen time, including being fat, irregular sleep , behavioral problems , weak school performance , violence and less time for active and creative play."

Why do some parents feel it difficult to spare quality time for their kids?	How can you help kids cope with stress? Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions. For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home.

But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away. ""Fish,"" the old man said. ""Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?"" That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many more turns. Yes, you are, he told himself. You're good for ever. On the next turn, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away. You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who. Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought. ""Clear up, head,"" he said in a voice he could hardly hear. ""Clear up."" Twice more it was the same on the turns. I do not know, the old man thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it once more. He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air. I'll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes. He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try it once again. He took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish's agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat, long, deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the water. The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength, and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish's side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the man's chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it. Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the skiff."	['man and nature']

Which of the following can be the best title?	"A group of swimmers has described how a group of dolphins protected them from a group of white sharks off the coast of New Zealand.

Lifeguard Rob Howes was in the water with a colleague and his teenage daughter. He said around half a dozen dolphins suddenly appeared and forced them to gather together. The mammals swam in tight circles to create a protective wall between the white sharks and the lifeguards as the great white sharks were under the surface. The swimmers said the dolphins were extremely upset and repeatedly slapped the water with their tails as if to try to prevent the white sharks from attacking them.

The author's purpose in writing the passage is to _ .	The area of child psychology is one of the most significant and well studied of all the branches of psychology. It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist.

What does the policeman say to Mr.Brown's daughter?	"Mr.Brown is 80 years old. Every morning he goes for a walk in the park. And he comes home at twelve thirty for lunch.But today a car stops at his house. At twelve, two policemen help him get out.One of them says to Mr.Brown's daughter, ""The old man can't find his way in the park. He asks us to take him home by car."" The daughter thanks the policemen and leave. Then she asks her father,""Dad, you go to that park every day. But today, you can't find the way. What's wrong with you?"" The old man smiles like a child and says, ""I can find my way. I don't want to walk home."""	"[""Mr.Brown can't find his way home""]"
Smallpox was so serious that _ by the end of l8th century	For well over a thousand years, smallpox was a disease that everyone feared. The disease killed much of the native population in South America when the Spanish arrived there in the early sixteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, smallpox was responsible for about one in ten deaths around the world. Those who survived the disease were left with ugly scars on their skin. It had long been well known among farmers that people who worked with cows seldom caught smallpox; instead, they often caught a similar but much milder disease called cowpox . A British doctor called Jenner was extremely interested in this, and so he studied cowpox. He believed that, by vaccinating people with the disease, he could protect them against the much worse disease smallpox. In 1796, he vaccinated a boy with cowpox and, two months later, with smallpox. The boy did not get smallpox. In the next two years, Jenner vaccinated several children in the same way, and none of them got the disease. News of the success of Jenner's work soon spread. Vaccination soon became a common method to protect people against other diseases caused by virus, such as rabies , and vaccines were sent across the world to the United States and India. It took nearly two centuries to achieve Jenner's dream of getting free of smallpox from the whole world. In 1967, the world Health Organization (WHO) started a great vaccination program, and the last known case of smallpox was recorded in Somalia in 1977. The story of vaccinations does not end there, however. There are many other diseases that kill more and more people every year. Besides, many new diseases are being discovered. The challenge for medical researchers will, therefore, probably continue for several more centuries	['one in ten deaths in the world was caused by smallpox']
Why have many people forgotten their dreams they had when they were young?	"Successful people always have a dream. They dream big dreams and then show great courage to do things that others say cannot be done. Your dreams form the foundation of success. Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids. As they grow older, they are simply too caught up with their work activities that they fail to discover what they really want to pursue in life. To get you back on track to pursue your dreams, follow these steps: Learn to dream again; We are born to dream. But we hear of teachers calling in school: ""Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!"" Parents , too, have shouted, ""Stop dreaming and go on with your homework!"" In the end, many do get ""realistic"" and give up their dreams in time. Dream big dreams; Never set mental boundaries on what you are able to achieve. Dreams are free anyway so as long as you are dreaming, you might as well dream big. Many people cannot realize their dreams and achieve greater success because they limit their own beliefs. Flee from dream killers; Dream killers are destructive to your success. Your friends, colleagues and even loved ones can be one of your dream killers. There are people who will try to change, confuse or persuade you to build the life they want, not the life that you want. Stop listening to the people who tell you why you will not achieve your dreams. You just need to believe you can do whatever it is you want to do. You should stop giving reasons why you cannot achieve your dreams. Many so-called reasons are merely excuse. Take action immediately; Once you have big and clear dreams, take immediate action to work toward making them come true. Weeks later, the passion will grow cold and months later, that passion may be gone forever. Think about this; Five birds are resting on the fence and minutes later, three birds decide to fly off to search for food. How many birds are left on the fence? Two? Wrong! There should still be five birds on the fence because deciding to fly off is not the same as the actual act of flying off."	['Because they are stuck in the work']
Which of the following can a parent say to his children to show that one's opinion does not reflect reality?	"Remind children that bad things don't last. It may sound simple, but the message is extremely important. ""Children often don't have the experience to know that when something bad happens---they lose an important game or their best friend lets them down---it's not the end of the world,"" explains Nancy Leffert, a senior research scientist with the Research Institute, an American adolescents and children's research group. ""They think their bad feelings will last for ever, or that one failure will ruin everything."" Unfortunately, that kind of thinking discourages motivation . ""If a child believes that the cause of her upset is lasting, or that nothing she does will make a difference, it decreases her ability to keep on trying."" says Dorothy Rich, president of the MegaSkills Education Center of the Home and School Institute, based in Washington. Any time you can help your child see that a situation is not lasting, that a result can be changed, or that one opinion does not reflect reality, you give her reason to hope. Case in point: ""When my daughter Kathy was eight, art was one of her favorite subjects,"" says Beth, a mother of two. ""Then she got an art teacher who gave a great deal of praise to one student and barely noticed the rest. Kathy was ready to give up until I explained to her, ""Never stop doing your best just because one person doesn't give you praise."" Beth had to repeat the advice often, and finally her daughter got the message. ""Kathy is 12 now, and art is still one of her strongest subjects."""	"['""That may be what your teacher thinks, but I see it differently.""']"
What's the best title for the passage?	"It was a beautiful summer afternoon. I happened to be at a local Walmart picking up some stuff for my wife when I laid my eyes on two young ladies. They were walking confidently, with their heads held high, which made me believe that they were involved in some kind of competitive sport. They were wearingT-shirts, at the back of which printed, ""Pain is temporary, but pride is forever."" Thinking of these words, I automatically said to myself, ""That's right! No pain, no gain."" Whatever is worth having is worth fighting for, and with fight, there comes pain! Fortunately, pain is just temporary. However, it is a necessary step you need to take to get your gain. Athletes and their coaches understand this so well. They spend so many hours and so much effort preparing for a competition. Some will think about giving up when the training is so painful, but coaches are there to remind them that ""quitters never win and winners never quit"".. So they know that when victory comes, they will be proud of themselves and that pride can last a lifetime. You've probably heard the saying, ""There's no such thing as a free lunch."" Well, it is true. Everything in life has a price, whether you agree or not. To want something for free will always lead to deception. Even if you get it, you will not value it or enjoy it, because it is free. No one has told you that life is easy! In fact it is a series of struggles and fights. You will achieve what other people call ""impossible"" only when you are willing to endure pain and overcome fear and doubt. Your achievement in life is in direct proportion to how much sacrifice you are willing to make. Successful people are usually and wrongly labeled as lucky or highly favored by circumstances. However, if you hear their personal stories, you will realize that they went through a lot of trials, but still kept on going, enduring the pain to make where they are today. If we understand that every effect has its cause, then we will grasp the fact that we do have a chance to influence the outcome we get in life."	['No pain, no gain.']
The reason why Rebecca's Pocket is still going strong is that _ .	"A ""blogger"" is a person who writes on an Internet computer Web site called a ""blog"". The word ""blog"" is a short way of saying Web log, or personal Web site. Anyone can start a blog, and they can write about anything they like. There are millions of blogs on the Internet today. They provide news, information and ideas in many people who read them. They contain links to other Web sites. And they provide a place for people to write about their ideas and react to the ideas of others. A research company called Perscus has studied more than 300 Web logs. It says that blogs are most popular with teenage girls. They use them to let their friends know what is happening in their lives. The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers stopped taking part in the activity after a year. However, some people develop serious blogs to present political and other ideas. For example, the Republican and Democratic parties in the southern state of Kentucky recently started their own blogs. And American companies are beginning to use blogs to advertise their products. At the same time, some long-standing blogs have ended last week, blogging leader Dave Winer closed his free blog service weblogs. com. He says the site became too costly to continue. He started the blog four years ago. And thousands of people had written on it. They are now upset because they did not know that the site was closing. One blog that is still going strong is called Rebecca's Pocket. Rebecca Blood created the Website in 1999. She wrote about the history of blogs on the site. That article led to a book called ""The Weblog Handbook"". It has been translated into four languages so far. Ms. Blood says Rebecca's Pocket gets about 30,000 visitors a month. She writes about anything and everything--politics, culture and movies. She recently provided medical advice. And she wrote about how to prevent people from stealing money from on-line bank accounts."	['it provides useful information and advice']
Which of the following can be used as the best title of the passage?_.	"On the Olympic flag, the rings appear on a white background. The flag reinforces the idea of the Olympic Movement's universality , as it brings together all the countries of the world. Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Olympic Games, explains the meaning of the flag: ""The Olympic flag has a white background, with five interlaced rings in the centre: blue, yellow, black, green and red. This design is symbolic; it represents the five continents of the world, united by Olympism, while the six color1s are those that appear on all the national flags of the world at the present time."" (1931) Combined in this way, the six color1s of the flag (including the white of the background) represent all nations. It is wrong, therefore, to believe that each of the color1s corresponds to a certain continent! At the Olympic Games, the flag is brought into the stadium during the opening ceremony. Since the 1960 Games in Rome (prefix = st1 /Italy), it has been carried horizontally by a delegation of athletes or other people well known for their positive work in society. After its arrival, the flag is hoisted up the flagpole. It must fly in the stadium during the whole of the Games. When the flag is lowered at the closing ceremony, it signals the end of the Games. The mayor of the host city of the Games passes the Olympic flag to the mayor of the next host city of the Games. In the history, even though Pierre de Coubertin intended the Olympic Games to be an international event from the time of their re-establishment in 1896 in Athens (Greece), it was only at the 1912 Games in Stockholm (Sweden) that, for the first time, the participants came from all five continents. One year later, in 1913, the five rings appeared at the top of a letter written by Pierre de Coubertin. He drew the rings and color1ed them in by hand. He then described this symbol in the Olympic Review of August 1913.It was also Coubertin who had the idea for the Olympic flag. He presented the rings and flag in June 1914 in Parisat the Olympic Congress. The First World War prevented the Games from being celebrated in 1916 in Berlin (Germany) as planned. It was not until 1920 in Antwerp (Belgium) that the flag and its five rings could be seen flying in an Olympic stadium. The universality conveyed by the rings and the flag was a new idea at the beginning of the 20th century. Nationalism was very strong and tension between certain countries was high. It was in this climate, however, that Coubertin proposed a symbol which aimed to encourage world unity."	['The History of the Olympic Flag']
What does the wall in Frost's poem stand for according to the author?	"""Good fences make good neighbors"", the television commentator said, misquoting Robert Frost for the millionth time in my memory.It made me wonder if the poet was not looking down from Heaven and sadly shaking his head. No line of poetry has ever been more misused in history than that one.It comes from Frost' s great poem Mending Wall.In it he writes of him and his neighbor repairing the broken stone wall that divides their property .Frost questions why they are doing so, because there are no animals that need fencing in.He sees as well that the wall is a symbol of the barriers that people create to separate themselves from each other.He wisely writes that, ""Before I built a wall I'd ask to know what I was walling in or walling out, and to whom I was like to give offence .'Something there is that doesn't love a wall, that wants it down'."" His neighbor, however, who Frost describes as a ""stone savage"" who ""moves in darkness"" refuses to part from the ways of his forefathers and goes along foolishly with their belief that ""Good fences make good neighbors."" I wonder if Mr.Frost would have ever written his poem if he had known that the line he wrote in irony would be used again and again to encourage what he was so against.Perhaps he would have written a different one about tearing down the fences that separate us and breaking apart the walls that hide our hearts from each other.Either way, we should embrace the wisdom he shared with us.Fences and walls separate us from each other.We need to take them down stone by stone, walk through them, and embrace each other in joy.We need to love our neighbors.We need to see that good fences DO NOT make good neighbors.They just make lonely hearts."	['The distance between neighbors.']
According to the passage, Mr. Kravis is probably _ .	"Q: My daughter is a junior in high school and has been on an individualized education program since fourth grade. She plans to go to college and intends to finish with a master's degree. Her performance in general is fairly good, but test scores are very low. She has held many leadership and volunteer positions. We have been advised to have her write an essay about how her learning disability is a barrier that she has to get over. Will that help or hurt her chances for admission? ---- Deborah A: First let me answer the question on low standardized test scores (ACT/SAT). There are hundreds of colleges that are ""test optional"" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found at fairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted. Please know that colleges do not deny admission based on disability. ""Disclosing"" a learning disability in a personal statement within the college application can certainly help. By writing a personal statement, students can potentially _ , for example, their understanding of the challenge they face. They might also prove an improved grade trend in that subject area, and show interest in more complex courses in spite of this disability. More importantly, a student disclosure can show self-confidence, motivation and an understanding of the disability. ---- Ms. Kravis"	['an educational expert']

What is the article mainly about?	"Since 1989, Dave Thomas, who died at the age of 69, was one of the most recognizable faces on TV. He appeared in more than 800 commercials for the hamburger chain named for his daughter. ""As long as it works"", he said in 1991, ""I'll continue to do those commercials."" Even though he was successful, Thomas remained troubled by his childhood. ""He still won't let anyone see his feet, which are out of shape because he never had proper fitting shoes,"" Wendy said in 1993. Born to a single mother, he was adopted as a baby by Rex and Auleva Thomas of Kalamazoo in Michigan. After Auleva died when he was 5, Thomas spent years on the road as Rex traveled around seeking construction work. ""He fed me,"" Thomas said, ""and if I got out of line, he'd beat me."" Moving out on his own at 15, Thomas worked, first as a waiter, in many restaurants. But he had something much better in mind. ""I thought if I owned a restaurant,"" he said, ""I could eat for free."" A 1956 meeting with Harland Sanders led Thomas to a career as the manager of a Kentucky Chicken restaurant that made him a millionaire in 1968. In 1969, after breaking with Sanders, Thomas started the first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, in Columbus, Ohio, which set itself apart by serving made-to-order burgers. With 6,000 restaurants worldwide, the chain now makes $ 6 billion a year in sales. Although troubled by his own experience with adoption, Thomas, married since 1954 to Lorraine, 66, and with four grown kids besides Wendy, felt it could offer a future for other children. He started the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption in 1992. In 1993, Thomas, who had left school at 15, graduated from Coconut Creek High School in Florida. He even took Lorraine to the graduation dance party. The kids voted him Most Likely to Succeed. ""The Dave you saw on TV was the real Dave,"" says friend Pat Williams.

What is the host 's responsibility in the author's eyes?	"Banquets are usually held in restaurants in private rooms that have been reserved for the purpose. You will be met at the door and led to the banquet room. Traditionally, the head of your delegation should enter the room first. Do not be surprised if your hosts greet you with a loud round of applause. The proper response is to applaud back. Seating arrangements are stricter than in the West. Guests should never assume that they may sit where they please and should wait for hosts to guide them to their places. Traditionally, the Chinese regard the right side as the superior and the left side as the inferior. Therefore on formal occasions, the host invariably arranges for the main guests to sit on his right side. It is the host's responsibility to serve the guests, and at very formal banquets people do not begin to eat until the host has served a portion to the principal guest. Or, the host may simply raise his chopsticks and announce that eating has begun. After this point, one may serve oneself any food in any amount. Remember to go slow on eating. Don't fill yourself up when five courses are left to go. To stop eating in the middle of a banquet is rude, and your host may incorrectly think that something has been done to offend you. Drinking takes an important place in Chinese banquets. It is likely that the host will stand and hold his glass out with both hands while saying a few words. When he says the words ""gan bei"",which means bottoms up, all present should drain their glasses. After this initial toast, drinking and toasting are open to all. No words are needed to make a toast, and it is not necessary to drain your glass, although to do so is more respectful. When filling another glass, it is polite to fill it as full as you can. This symbolizes full respect and friendship. When the last dish is finished, the banquet has officially ended. There is little ceremony involved with its conclusion. The host may ask if you have eaten your fill. Then the principal host will rise, signaling that the banquet has ended. Generally, the principal host will bid good evening to everyone at the door and stay behind to settle the bill with the restaurateur. Other hosts usually accompany guests to their vehicles and remain outside waving until the cars have left the premises."	['Arranging for guests to go to their place..']
If you don't need to try the T-shirts on, you can visit _ .	Football T-shirts are more commonly connected with boys than girls. This can often cause a problem when you want to find a cool shirt for a girl. That is not to say that there are no cool shirts out there for girls to wear. The problem is that they are often harder to find than the ones for boys. You can get custom shirt printed for girls from a number of custom print stores. Of course you have to make sure that they are legally allowed to use the logos and colours of the team you want to support. You can also go through official channels to get the shirt you want. The official channels will generally be the large sportswear stores or the official stores of the teams. These stores will be able to use the colours of the teams and even put the name of the person who the shirt is for on it. If you do not feel like you have to try the T-shirts on, then an online store may be your best choice. The reason for this is that you can visit various stores and find the best ones. If you want to see what the T-shirt looks like in real life, then going to a store is the best choice. Large sportswear stores often have football shirts. These are the best places to go if you do not live close to an official store. And these stores usually have lower prices than the official stores.	['online stores']
The writer considered the guidebook interesting because he found in it_.	I came across an old country guide the other day. It listed all the tradesmen in each village in my part of the country and it was impressive to see the great variety of services which were available on one's own doorstep in the late Victorian countryside. Nowadays a superficial traveler in ruralprefix = st1 /Englandmight conclude that the village tradesmen still flourishing were either selling frozen food to the residents or selling old things to visitors. Nevertheless. This would really be a false impression. There has been smaller village commerce ,but its vigor is still remarkable. Our local grocer's shop, for example, is actually expanding in spite of the competition from supermarkets in the nearest town. Women prefer to go there and exchange the local news while purchasing, instead of purchasing up at a supermarket. And the shop owner knows well that personal service has a substantial cash value. His prices may be a bit higher than those in the town, but he will deliver anything at any time. His assistants think nothing of bicycling down the village street in their lunch hour to take a piece of cheese to an aged woman who sent her order by word of mouth with a friend who happened to be passing. The wealthier customers telephone their shopping lists and the goods are on their doorsteps within an hour. I also find it satisfactory because a village shop offers one of the few ways in which a modest individualist can still get along in the world without attaching himself to the big groups of industry or commerce. Most of the village shopkeepers I know, are individualists in their ways. For example, our shoemaker stares with a cold look at the pairs of cheap, mass-produced shoes taken to him for repair. Has it come to this, he seems to be saying, that he, a craftsman , work upon them. And he makes beautiful shoes for those who can afford such luxury .

Where did the story take place?	"Charlie was spending his summer holidays by the sea. One day he climbed over some rocks. He was looking for some crabs for supper.

In Compton-Rock's opinion, the Bushwick kids _ .	"Bushwick is a tough place to grow up. This part of Brooklyn, in New York City, has a lot of crime. More than half of its 100,000 residents rely on aid from the government. Only 50% of students at Bushwick High School graduate in four years. Some people might say, ""We should help these poor kids who have so many challenges."" But Malaak Compton-Rock looks at the teens in Bushwick and says, "" Go to help kids who have even bigger challenges than you do."" She believes that once young people see the power they have to make things better, they can handle their own problems more easily. So her service group, the Angel Rock Project, took 30 Bushwick kids to Soweto, in South Africa, to help poor families there. Soweto is a township outside the city of Johannesburg. The effort, called Journey for Change, aims to show that any kid can change the world. ""Kids in Bushwick face pressure to drop out of school or become involved in gangs and drugs."" Says Compton-Rock. ""We want them to live a life of purpose and service."" In Soweto, many parents have died of AIDS, a deadly disease. When that happens, a grandparent or a child must lead the family. The Bushwick volunteers helped such families. They tended vegetable gardens, cared for babies and bought groceries. ""The saddest thing was when we visited an orphanage and I helped a little boy who had been abandoned because he had HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,"" says Queen Clyde, 12. ""It's been good to be on this trip. But what's also important is what we do when it's finished. That's what counts."" "" I never appreciated what I had until I saw some people who had nothing,"" says Sadara Lewis, 12 ""It's really changed my attitude. I want to make a difference."" The trip was two weeks long. But the kids, aged 12 to 15, will spend all year speaking about their experience, fund-raising and more."	['can learn to deal with their own problems by helping others']
When he got on the plane he was happy to find that _ .	"Mr. Robinson had to travel somewhere on business and as he was in a hurry, he decided to go by air. He liked to sit beside a window when he was flying. So, when he got on to the plane, he looked for a window seat. He found all of them had already been taken except one. There was a soldier sitting in the seat beside this one and Mr. Robinson was happy that he had not taken the one by the window; but, anyhow, he at once went towards it. When he reached it, however, he saw there was a notice on it. It was written in ink and said ""This seat is reserved for proper load balance. Thank you."" Mr. Robinson had never seen such a notice in a plane before, but he thought that the plane must be carrying something heavy in its baggage room which made it necessary to have the passengers properly balanced, so he walked on and found another empty seat, not beside a window, to sit in. Then, when the plane was quite full, a very beautiful girl stepped into the plane. The soldier quickly took the notice off the seat beside him and in this way succeeded in having the girl beside him during the whole trip."	['there was a seat that he had hoped to have']
Why do people in Copenhagen want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather?	"Considered one of Europe's two ""bicycle capitals"" along with Amsterdam, Copenhagen counts more bicycles than people and cycling is so popular that its numerous bike paths can become crowded. Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade road used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. ""You have to elbow your way in to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,"" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell. The creation of bike highways ""comes right on time"", says Danish Cyclist Federation Spokesman Frits Bredal. ""Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,"" he says. ""If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycles have supposed that role today,"" Bredal says. ""It's a _ of transportation used by all social classes, even politicians ride bikes,"" he says. It is on crowded Noerrebrogade--the busiest bicycle street in Europe, according to the cyclist association--that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly roads. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four metres on either side of the road, which itself will be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade ""Europe's great cycling street"", says Andreas Roehl, Copenhagen government's bicycle program manager who is also known as ""Mr. Bike"". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner-city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to hike the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 37 percent it is today to 50 percent by 2015."

How did the author feel on his father's active participation?	"Following Christmas dinner,my family was relaxing around the kitchen table.The goodcooking smells still stayed.My sister,our chef, was enjoying the compliments.""Delicious meal!""""Everything was wonderful.""Dad had risen from his chair and was contentedly standing nearby. My nephew,never one to sit still for too long,began playing his new basketball around the table and throughout the kitchen.Upon nearing Dad,he stopped----almost uncertainly.With shaking,wrinkled hands,Dad had reached out for the ball.He did not speak,and the boy,confused,looked up and over at us.It took some convincing,but the ball was lightly passedover. I watched my father closely to see what he would do.A playful smile appeared on his face.Holding the ball and reaching forward,Dad bounced it on the floor then caught it.This action was repeated.Nodding approvingly,he then turned towards our assembled group.Gently throwing the ball away,Dad began a game of catch. The ball continued to be passed though eager pairs of outstretched hands.Cries of""Over here!""rang through the warm kitchen.Dad's active participation in this game was remarkable to me,since he had advanced Alzheimer's disease.This disease had robbed him of many memories and the recognition of people,places mid points in time. In my younger years,playing with Dad was rare.To his credit,Dad worked hard and provided for us.He was very private and never showed nor shared much emotion.His game of choice was chess,which he did eventually teach me how to play.As an adult,I had become a caregiver and watched helplessly as Dad declined.Connecting moments between father and son had been few and far before he took the basketball. I'm not sure how long we played catch.What I do know is that our game ended all too soon,and it was time to face the reality of dirty dishes piled high on countertops.The moment,though,will certainly last forever.On this Christmas,Dad gave me a special memory--one that I will always treasure."

_ brought the debris on the beach.	"The old man woke up before sunrise, as he often did, to walk by the beach and greet the new day. As he moved through the early morning, he saw a young man , bending and reaching and throwing, in celebration of the perfect day soon to begin As he came near, he realized that the young man was not dancing to the day, , but rather bending to check the debris (, ) left by the night's tide , stopping now and then to take starfish and then standing, to throw it back into the sea. He asked the young man the purpose of the effort.""The tide has washed the starfish onto the beach and they cannot return to the sea by themselves ,"" the young man repied.""when the sun rises, they will die, unless I throw them back into the sea."" As the young man explained, the old man looked at the beach .""But there are more starflish on this beach than you can ever save before the sun is up. Surely you cannot expect to make a difference."" The young man listened politely. Then he bent down to take another starfish, threw it into the sea and said,""It made a difference for that one."" There is something very special in each and every one of us."	"[""The night's tide""]"
What is Not True about Mumbai?	"Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called ""Bollywood"". Each year, Bollywood makes twice as many movies as Hollywood. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, adventure, mystery and romance. Because Bollywood films has so many different characters, this style of film is called a ""masala"" film. Masala is an Indian word for a mixture of spices . Another big difference is the way the movies are made. It takes longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the filming is being made. Sometimes they even write the script by hand instead of typing it. Bollywood actors are so popular that some of them may even work on several movies at the same time. They may even make several different films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps to keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies."	['The new name is Bombay.']

"Norm Pethrick, a 36-year-old man in Australia's northern city Darwin, was praised on Thursday for jumping onto a crocodile's back to save his wife Wendy at Litchfield National Park, a popular tourist spot southwest of Darwin, a local newspaper reported. Ms Pethrick was standing on a river bank Wednesday afternoon when the saltwater crocodile lunged , locking its jaws on both her legs as it tried to drag her underwater. Norm Pethrick, who with his wife had been collecting water, immediately went to help her. He jumped onto the back, poked the eyes of the crocodile and finally got his wife free. Ms Pethrick was later taken to Royal Darwin Hospital for a medical treatment. The doctors said she was suffering eight puncture wounds in her right leg, a puncture wound in her left leg and a serious cut to one of her fingers. ""This could have been a fatal and tragic situation,"" said the general manager of Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH), Dr Len Notaras, according to a local report. He said Ms Pethrick was saved by her husband's ""quick and diligent actions"". Dr Notaras also said she would remain in hospital for three to four days and have an operation to clean the wounds, which are easy to get infected because of bacteria on the teeth of the crocodile."

According to the passage, whose name might be kept secret for some time?	"WASHINGTON -- It is announced Friday that White House visitor records will be opened up on a regular basis for the first time in modern history, providing the public an unusually detailed look at who gets the opportunity to help shape American policy at the highest levels. ""Americans have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process,"" the president said in a written statement issued by the White House while he vacationed with his family at Camp David. By the end of the year, the White House will begin posting online every month the names of the people who visited in the last 90 to 120 days. Each person's full name will be listed, along with the date and time they entered and left and the name of the person they visited. About 70,000 to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, and the records will include tourists as well as people conducting business. The White House pointed out several exceptions to the policy: ""purely personal guests"" of the Obama family; those cases in which the disclosure of visitors' names ""would threaten national safety interests""; and those who come for ""particularly sensitive meetings,"" like candidates for a Supreme Court nomination . Officials said only a ""small number"" will fit in the latter category , and their names would eventually be disclosed after they are no longer secret, like after a nomination is publicly announced. Moreover, they said, the number of undisclosed visitors will be disclosed, to make clear how few they are."	['A foreign minister.']
"People who believe in ""pain before beauty"" will _ ."	"High heels were first worn in the 1500s, and were popular with both women and men. Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as ""shoe girl"". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels. Even though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, ""I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty."" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers. Still, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, ""It takes a long time to feel the effects. And once you do, it's too late."" Despite the damage high heels can do to the feet and legs, they remain popular. Most women accept the pain because they like how they look wearing high heels. It is important that we all understand that we should never hurt ourselves just to please others."	['wear pretty but uncomfortable fashion']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?	"Patricia Blues, 29, has a new aim in life: to keep drivers' hands on their steering wheels and off their cell phones. On November 2, 2007, Blues lived through a horrible experience. A motorist dialing a cell phone drove through a stop sign at 45 miles per hour and ran into the side of Blues' car. Blues' 2-year-old daughter was killed immediately in the crash. Blues has since devoted her time top pushing for laws that would prevent this type of tragedy from happening again. Cell phones are not the only distractions that cause accidents. Eating, changing CDs, reading maps, talking to passengers, and just reaching for an object on the floor can be dangerous. Therefore, the emphasis should be on educating drivers to avoid all distractions. However, talking on cell phones might be easier to regulate than eating or changing music. At least 34 states have already passed laws to restrict cell phone use in moving cars. No state has banned it yet, but several US. cities. Worldwide, 13 nations, including Australia, England, Germany, Japan and China have banned drivers' use of cell phones in moving cars. To date, no scientific evidence has been published showing that talking on the phone affects driving safety. But according to a test by some high school students, ""driving while on the phone does affect safety and probably shouldn't be done""."

Fidenzio Salvatori, with two other students, has got two thousand dollars from the government _ .	"Fidenzio Salvatori is determined that the city of Toronto will have an outdoor marketplace for merchants from its immigrant community, complete with dancing and other forms of amusement form their native countries. ""Toronto is truly multicultural ,"" he said in a newspaper interview. ""It's a city from many places, and multicultural marketplace will help Torontonians to understand and appreciate the rich variety of cultural groups in our city."" Salvatori, aged 23, will soon complete his studies at the University of Toronto. He was eleven years old when he came to Canada from Italy with his parents. ""Most of Toronto's immigrants are from lands where the marketplace has always been part of daily life,"" he said. Salvatori has been interested in getting an open-air market for Toronto for the last three years. This year, with the help of two fellow students, he prepared a proposal on the subject and presented it to the city's Executive committee, asking for their support. The proposal pointed out Toronto's rich variety of national groups, ""whose customs include market shopping."" Under a Canadian government program for multiculturalism, the three students have received two thousand dollars with which they will do a study to find out whether Toronto's immigrant businessmen would support an open-air market. They hope the merchants will support the plan strongly. ""A study done earlier this year showed that 90 percent of shoppers would be in favor of it,"" Salvatori said. ""At first it would be an experiment. But we think it will prove to be good business for the merchants, as well as tourist attraction."""	['to start a marketplace']

Who are the intended readers of the passage?	"Moving to a new neighborhood,town,state,or even country can be a pretty scary experience. All you know is that things will be different and chances are you won't know the kids at your new school. The experiences that go with moving make many kids feel nervous and worried. This is perfectly normal but don't let these emotions overrun your thoughts! You will soon get used to your surroundings and find new friends at your new school. Leaving old friends and familiar places behind can be difficult. However,as you begin the moving process,keep in mind that saying goodbye to your old house,school,and friends does not mean that you have to forget them or that your farewell is permanent!If you're moving to a new state or even a different country and won't see your friends for a long time,don't despair. Make sure to ask everyone for their address so you can write them letters. Also,thanks to the Internet,it is very easy to stay in touch through email or instant messaging technologies. With your parent's permission,you can even create a blog or web page to chronicle all of your new experiences. Include your thoughts,tales of your new adventures,even pictures of new friends,your new house,and new town. Your old friends will love seeing what you are busy with. Many schools have an orientation program where a student already established at the school shows a new student around for their first week. This can help you to find your way around the school and to make new friends faster. While moving is tough on kids of any age,high school counselor Karen Turner says moves can be particularly difficult for teens .""I think moving during adolescents is an extremely stressful experience,especially if you are into your junior high or senior year. Students tend to have established a very strong peer network during that period in their lives. Often this has more influence on them even than their families in some cases,and when they are torn from that there's often resentment .""However,Turner adds that while moving isn't easy,there are things that your parents and the school can do to help you deal with the change."

Supporters of the present emphasis on research argue that _ .	"For the most part, schools are designed to produce people who fit into society, not people who set out to change it. However, schools, particularly universities, may not only spread culture; they may add to the cultural heritage. Today American society places a good deal of emphasis on the development of new knowledge, especially in the physical and biological sciences, medicine, and engineering. In recent years, the nation's leading universities have increasingly become research centres. An emphasis on research has led universities to judge professors not by abilities as teachers, but as researchers. Promotions, salary increases, and other benefits have long been dependent on research and publication. However, the most important is no longer publishing. To be successful these days, professors have to bring in money provided by government and private industry. Critics claim that academic success is most likely to come to those who have learned to ""ignore"" their teaching duties to pursue research activities. Defenders say that even when students themselves are not involved in research projects they benefit from such an emphasis on research. Major research universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have also cooperated with industrial companies to develop technology and products with commercial potential. With university-industry ties continuing to grow, debate has increased about the consequences for basic science, academic openness, the control of information, the direction of research, and the influence on students."

When did Sally do her homework?	Teenagers in England do much the same as children in America do. They enjoy sending messages by their mobile phones and they also like swimming, listening to the latest music, watching TV and surfing the Internet. How do teenagers in England spend their free time and holidays? Let's follow Sally, a British teenager, and spend five days with her during her school holiday. Day One After breakfast, Sally's mother went out and left her alone at home. She checked her mobile phone during lunch --one of her friends sent her a message early in the morning. Dinner was at 6:30 p.m. After that, she finished her English home-work. Then she surfed the Internet. Day Two Sally and her mother paid a visit to their friends and went swimming together. Later, they went shopping for clothes and books, and had dinner in a restaurant. Day Three She went to the supermarket with her mother to buy fish and chips for lunch as well as some pens. After she got back home, she spent the next few hours surfing the Internet and watching TV. Day Four She surfed the Internet. Her mother took her out for lunch before she went to work. She then read stories after lunch. Day Five She woke up at 2 p.m., and so did her mother. They went to a park. Her mother met some friends there. When they got home, it was already time for dinner. Afterwards, she did her homework until 10 p.m.	['In the evening.']

How many experts express their ideas about the future of English in the passage?	"English is fast becoming the language of science around the world, but what is its future among everyday speakers? One expert points out that the percentage of native English speakers is declining while the languages of other rapidly growing regions are being spoken by increasing numbers of people. But English will continue to remain widespread and important. However,British language scholar David Graddol says English will probably drop in dominance by the middle of this century to rank,after Chinese,about equally with Arabic,Hindi,and Urdu. ""The number of people speaking English as a first language continues to rise,but it isn't rising nearly as fast as the numbers of many other languages around the world,simply because the main population group has been largely in the less developed countries where languages other than English have been spoken,"" he says. In a recent article in the journal Science,Mr. Graddol noted that three languages that are not near the top of the list of the most widely spoken now might be there soon. These are Bengali,Tamil,and Malay,spoken in south and southeast Asia. David Crystal,the author of The Cambridge Encycloredia of the English Laeguage, says about 1. 5 billion of the world's six billion people speak it as a second tongue compared to the 400 million native speakers. But another expert on the English language says Mr. Graddol underestimates the future of its dominance. _ but nobody quite knows what's going to happen because no language has been in this position before.

Which word can be used to complete the following process of changes?	Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule. The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes. That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer. So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells.	['exposed']
The writer did NOT feel comfortable at the evening school because _ .	"Although I had left school against the advice of my teacher, I had, without telling anyone, tried to continue my studies in literature at evening classes. It was a tiresome walk from one end of the city to another and to sit among adults was uninteresting. I was the youngest in the class, so the friendship I knew at school was absent, I put up with it for a short period. It was too long a walk on cold winter's nights and it was hard to put my heart into Shakespeare with wet shoes and trousers. So I continued reading books and started writing poetry at home. By chance, I won some prizes and rewards for literature. A young woman from a TV company came to the college one day. She wanted to make a short film about me, to which I said, ""No, I couldn't do that."" Not that I had any real excuse, I was just frightened. In the end she persuaded me that I should do it the following day. So I did. They made a short film of me reading one of my poems and I became more interested in literature than ever. I wondered what I should do after this, and decided some weeks later that I could not imagine myself spending the rest of my days dealing with machines. So one evening, I hesitatingly told my parents that I wanted to return to school. They wanted to know if I was sure, if I knew what it meant and whether I realized that if I gave up my job training, it would be very difficult to get a good job. But nothing could stop me, and they asked about the matter on future."	['all of the above']

From the text we know that _ .	"A fad diet is a diet that suddenly becomes popular, usually because it promises people that they will lose a lot of weight overnight. Although dieters may really show weight loss from a fad diet, they will almost certainly get back the weight if their usual eating habits remain unchanged.

Worse yet, certain fad diets don't include nutrients good for health. People have been known to become very ill as a result of following medically unhealthy diets.

What can be inferred from the story?	"On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to a store to buy some gifts. While looking in the toys section,.

"" It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas.She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.""

"" My sister has gone to be with God.Daddy says that Mommy will also join God very soon so I think that she can take the doll with her to give it to my sister."" My heart nearly stopped.

Then, he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing.He told me, "" I also want Mommy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me, I love my Mommy and I wish she didn't have to leave me but Daddy says that she has to go and join my little sister.""

There are accidents and there are delays .At certain stops, there are surprises. Some of these will change into great moments of joy; some will result in bad results. When we are born and we first get on the train, we meet people who we think will be with us for the whole journey. Those people are our parents. Sadly, this is far from the truth. Our parents are with us when we completely need them. They, too, have journeys they must complete. We live on with the memories of their love, support and so on. There are others who get on the train and who finally become very important to us. These people are our brothers, sisters and friends, whom we will learn to love and take care of. Some people regard their journey as a pleasant tour. They will just go happily along. Others will _ many upsets, tears and losses on their journey. Some others will stay on to offer a helping hand to anyone in need. Some people on the train will leave a deep impression when they get off. Some will get on and get off the train so quickly that they will hardly leave a sign. We will sometimes be upset that some passengers, whom we love, will choose to sit in another compartment and leave us to travel on our own. Then again, there's nothing that says we can't look for them anyway. But when we find them, we may not even be able to sit next to them because that seat will already be taken.

The Star left London for _ .	"Holmes said, ""Somebody sent a letter with five pips in it from India, and arrived seven weeks later to kill John's uncle. Then they sent five pips from Scotland and arrived three days later to kill John's father. Now they have sent five pips to John from London!"" ""The letters are all from sea ports . The writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters,"" I replied. ""Very good, Watson! And John's enemy is in London already!"" ""Well, I hope they won't kill young John,"" I said. But they did. The next morning, we read in the newspaper that a policeman found him die near Waterloo station. Holmes was very angry about it. ""He came to me for help and those men murdered him!

Why does the author refer to Aristotle and Madison?	"Freedom and Responsibility Freedom's challenge in the Digital Age is a serious topic. We are facing today a strange new world and we are all wondering what we are going to do with it. Some 2,500 years ago Greece discovered freedom. Before that there was no freedom. There were great civilizations, splendid empires, but no freedom anywhere. Egypt and Babylon were both _ , one very powerful man ruling over helpless masses. In Greece, in Athens , a little city in a little country, there were no helpless masses. And Athenians willingly obeyed the written laws which they themselves passed, and the unwritten, which must be obeyed if free men live together. They must show each other kindness and pity and the many qualities without which life would be very painful unless one chose to live alone in the desert.The Athenians never thought that a man was free if he could do what he wanted. A man was free if he was self-controlled. To make yourself obey what you approved was freedom. They were saved from looking at their lives as their own private affair. Each one felt responsible for the welfare of Athens, not because it was forced on him from the outside, but because the city was his pride and his safety. The essential belief of the first free government in the world was liberty for all men who could control themselves and would take responsibility for the state. But discovering freedom is not like discovering computers. It cannot be discovered once for all. If people do not prize it, and work for it, it will go. Constant watch is its price. Athens changed. It was a change that took place without being noticed though it was of the extreme importance, a spiritual change which affected the whole state. It had been the Athenian' s pride and joy to give to their city. That they could get material benefits from her never entered their minds. There had to be a complete change of attitude before they could look at the city as an employer who paid her citizens for doing her work. Now instead of men giving to the state, the state was to give to them. What the people wanted was a government which would provide a comfortable life for them; and with this as the primary object, ideas of freedom and self-reliance and responsibility were neglected to the point of disappearing. Athens was more and more looked on as a cooperative business possessed of great wealth in which all citizens had a right to share. Athens reached the point when the freedom she really wanted was freedom from responsibility. There could be only one result. If men insisted on being free from the burden of self-dependence and responsibility for the common good, they would cease to be free. Responsibility is the price every man must pay for freedom. It is to be had on no other terms. Athens, the Athens of Ancient Greece, refused responsibility; she reached the end of freedom and was never to have it again. But, ""the excellent becomes the permanent"", Aristotle said. Athens lost freedom forever, but freedom was not lost forever for the world. A great American, James Madison, referred to: ""The capacity of mankind for self-government."" No doubt he had not an idea that he was speaking Greek. Athens was not in the farthest background of his mind, but once man has a great and good idea, it is never completely lost. The Digital Age cannot destroy it. Somehow in this or that man's thought such an idea lives though unconsidered by the world of action. One can never be sure that it is not on the point of breaking out into action only sure that it will do so sometime."	['The author is hopeful about freedom.']
What does the writer intend to tell us through the passage?	"When we are unfamiliar with something,we may feel nervous and fearful.The assistance of others is a good way to help us pull through. I write for a big newspaper, and I wanted to write a story about parachute jumping.To make it a realistic as well as exciting story,I decided that I first had to make a jump myself. Unfortunately,I am not good at any sports of any kind,let alone parachute jumping. My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand.He took me to a ground school.The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first drop from an airplane For this,I had to wait until the following morning. The next morning,after a hurried,anxious breakfast,I was taken to the airfield.There,two heavy parachutes were put on my back,and an orange helmet was pushed down onto my head.Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped slowly on the runway. Once on board,the plane was soon climbing.I began to feel nervous.As we reached one thousand metres,Harry,my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane.The line was to pull my parachute open after I jumped. ""Get ready, Henry,""Harry said.I moved carefully to the door.I wanted to cry,""No,no,no!""But no word came. ""Jump!""Harry called loudly.""Jump!"" To my surprise,kicking like a frog I did jump.Away from the plane,and down,down I fell,arms stretched.It worked! The air seemed to hold me up.All at once I was very happy. Then I felt a quick pull.My big parachute had opened! It was the best surprise I ever had. I looked down.There were rivers,trees,fields and houses.I heard the soft sound of the air This was fun !"

What would be an example of integrative medicine?	The human body is an amazing and complex machine. It is very tough, and we usually recover from illness or injury on our own, without the help of a doctor. But what happens when we need medical treatment? In the past, some people went to a clinic or hospital to see a medical doctor. Other people trusted ancient traditions and chose treatments such as herbal medicine or acupuncture . These two types of medicine----one modern and Western and the other ancient and Eastern----used to have nothing to do with each other. In recent years, however, people around the world have begun to recognize and accept both modern medical science and more traditional therapies. This new kind of medicine can be called integrative medicine (because it integrates, or combines, different types of medicine), or complementary medicine. Some of the principles of this type of medicine include preventing illness by helping people stay healthy, integrating different types of therapies according to the needs of each patient, and considering the health of the whole person rather than concentrating on a particular illness or injury. One health maintenance organization (HMO) in Madison, Wisconsin, has opened its Complementary Medicine and Wellness Center. At the center, HMO members are offered a variety of services. If you are suffering a sore back, try some massage treatments to relax your muscles and encourage the flow of healing energy in your body. If you have allergies or asthma, you could try homeopathy, which uses tiny amounts of allergens to stimulate your body's natural immune response. And if you're not ill, but just want to improve your strength and focus your mind, try a tai chi or yoga class. Patients who use these complementary medicine services appreciate having an alternative to surgery or to drugs and their side effects. They also enjoy activities and therapies that make them feel better even if they're not sick. And from the financial point of view of the HMO, preventing illness whenever possible is much less expensive than a hospital stay. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, founder of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, integrative medicine combines the best parts of Western medicine with complementary therapies such as acupuncture and nutrition. And because both doctor and patient are working to prevent illness, they become partners with the same goal instead of strangers who see each other only when the patient is sick.

The knowledge one gains by traveling in a foreign country is often _ .	Every country tends to accept its own way of life as being the normal one and to praise or criticize others, as they are similar to or different from it. And unfortunately, our picture of the people and the way of life of other countries is often a distorted one. Here is a great argument in favor of foreign travel and learning foreign languages. It is only by traveling in a country and getting to know its inhabitants and their language that one can find out what a country and its people are really like. And how different the knowledge one gains this way frequently turns out to be from the second-hand information gathered from other sources! How often we find that the foreigners whom we thought to be such different people from ourselves are not very different at all! Differences between peoples do, of course, exist and, one hopes, will always continue to do so. The world will be a dull place indeed when all the different nationalities behave exactly alike, and some people might say that we are rapidly approaching this state of affairs. With the much greater rapidity and ease of travel, there might seem to be some truth in this at least as far as Europe is concerned. However this may be, at least the greater ease of travel today has revealed to more people than ever before that the Englishman or Frenchman or German is not some different kind of animal from themselves.	['different from what one had before the travel']
69. Which of the following is NOT true according to Paragraph 4?	Lack of exercise is considered a risk factor for cancer. There is considerable evidence that inactivity is connected with increased risk for lung cancer, breast cancer, etc. In the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, more than 32,000 people (25,000 men and 7,000 women) were given a preventive medical examination that included a machine exercise test to measure physical fitness. They were given a physical fitness score, with one being the lowest and five being the highest fitness level. Then these people were followed for an average of 8 years. During this time, 179 men and 44 women died of cancer. Data from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study show people have lower rates of cancer with higher levels of physical fitness. Studies from the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas suggest that men with high fitness levels are less likely to die of cancer. The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study also found that fitness level was more important than weight in predicting longevity . While results showed that fitness and normal weight are the ideal combination, researchers found that men who were fat but performed well in the machine performance had just a slightly increased all-cause death rate, including cancer, compared to the more slim men. The fat, but fit, men particularly lived longer than the slim, but flabby , men. These statistics called for a warning to the overweight: The first health goal for the overweight should be to become as fit as possible at their current weight.	['Slim men are more likely to live longer.']
What kind of planet might NOT support life?	Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way. As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist. Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it. Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify. Finally, life could evolve only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away. If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out. This process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which earthlike life might be found. However, even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, there are so many billions of planets that this would still leave a vast number on which life could exist.

To the suitors including English courtiers and foreign princes,Elizabeth _ .	"""I will never marry,"" the future Elizabeth I declared at the age of eight, and, to the terror of her people, the Great Queen kept her word. For four centuries, historians have guessed why Elizabeth never married.In her own day, her decision to remain single was considered absurd and dangerous.A queen needed a husband to make political decisions for her and to organise and lead her military campaigns.More important, she needed male heirs to avoid a civil war after her death. There was no shortage of suitors for the Queen, both English courtiers and foreign princes, and it was confidently expected for the best part of 30 years that Elizabeth would eventually marry one of them.Indeed, although she insisted that she preferred the single state, she kept these suitors in a state of permanent expectation.This was a deliberate policy on the Queen's part, since by keeping foreign princes in hope, sometimes for a decade, she kept them friendly when they might otherwise have made war on her kingdom. There were, indeed, good political reasons for her avoiding marriage.The disastrous union of her sister Mary I to Philip II of Spain had had an unwelcome foreign influence upon English politics.The English were generally prejudiced against the Queen taking a foreign husband, particularly a Catholic one.Yet if she married an English, jealousy might lead to the separation of the court. There were other, deeper reasons for Elizabeth's unwillingness to marry, chief of which, I believe, was her fear of losing her autonomy as Queen. In the 16th century, a queen was regarded as holding supreme dominion over the state, while a husband was thought to hold supreme dominion over his wife.Elizabeth knew that marriage and motherhood would bring some harm to her power. She once pointed out that marriage seemed too uncertain a state for her. She had seen several unions in her immediate family break down, including that of her own parents. Some writers, based on very fragile evidence, have argued that Elizabeth was frightened or incapable of the sex act, but it is more likely that she feared childbirth. Two of her stepmothers, her grandmother and several acquaintances had died in childbed. Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII, had had her mother, Anne Boleyn, killed; her stepmother Catherine Howard later suffered the same fate. When Elizabeth was 14 she was all but attracted by Admiral Thomas Seymour, who also went to the prison within a year. Witnessing these terrible events at an early age, it has been argued, may have put Elizabeth off marriage. Elizabeth had to decide her priorities. Marriage or being single? Elizabeth was far too intelligent.The choice she made was courageous and revolutionary, and, in the long run, the right one for England."	['kept them expecting deliberately']
About being green, which of the following is NOT true?	"""Green"" is more than just a color. It also means taking special steps to protect the environment--the water, the land, and the air we breathe. Why green? Plants are green, and without them the earth wouldn't be such a lovely home for us human beings. Every day, people make choices that affect the amount of trash and pollution that gets produced in our world. What can you do? A whole lot, actually. Here's a four-step guide to being green: Reduce the amount of stuff you use and throw away. Reuse stuff when you can. Recycle cans, bottles, paper, books, and even toys, Sometimes water can be. For instance, some communities take used water - like from the washing machine and shower - and clean it up so it's safe to use for watering the grass and flowers. Enjoy the Earth - walk in the woods, plant a tree, and eat some of the delicious food it produces. Here's a list of other stuff you can reduce: Close the switches when you're not using lights. Turn off the water when you're brushing your teeth.. When you can, walk or ride your bike instead of driving in the car. You'll use less gas - and get some exercise! Turn off for your phone and MP3 player when you're not using them. Put your computer to ""sleep"" instead of leaving it on with the screensaver running."	['Leave your computer on for long']
Which of the following is TRUE about saving for college?	College is a lifetime investment -- the gift of a college education can open the door to a world of opportunity for your child or grandchild. Savings , even not so many at a time, can make a big difference. With the cost of a college education continuing to rise, the key is to start saving early and regularly. By saving a set amount at set times, your money can grow as your child does. According to the College Board, the average cost for four-year public colleges has increased by nearly 51% over the last 10 years and these costs will almost certainly continue to rise. Saving for college can help with the increasing cost of a college education and help you be well prepared when your child is ready for college. Saving for your child's college education is an investment in their future. The savings you make today will pay off in increased earnings in the future. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, college graduates earn an average of $1 million more than high school graduates during their careers. The value of your investment in a college education will continue to grow for a lifetime. Set your college saving goals realistically. You may not be able to save enough for all four years' fees, but you could save enough to give your child the right start. More and more families depend on student loans to pay for college. By saving for college, families will have less burden of paying off loans and help their children leave school without worrying about paying off loans.	"[""It's better to save early and regularly.""]"
When Payne got home, he found _ .	The judge thought Geoffrey Payne killed his wife. Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999. I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do. The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood?	['Ellen lying on the floor, blood all over']
What most probably caused the death of languages in the USA and Australia?	"Can a Language Become Extinct? A language can become extinct when the last person who can speak it passes away. Or more likely when the secondlast person who speaks it dies because then there is no one left to talk to. According to linguists there is nothing unusual about a single language dying out. But what is happening today is quite remarkable. According to the recent statistics, there are approximately 6,000 languages in the world as we speak. Of these, about half are going to die out in the next century. There are several reasons as to why a language can eventually die out. These range from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to sociological factors, like cultural assimilation, in which the culture of a minority group is gradually replaced by a stronger one. The former can cause tribes to leave their natural habitat and therefore become fewer and fewer in number. However, it doesn't happen very frequently. In fact, the latter is a much bigger threat and it is responsible for the extinction of a lot of languages in countries like the USA and Australia. For instance, Chemehuevi is one of the languages which is really close to dying out since its sole speaker is an old, yet healthy, man named Johnny Hill, Jr. It is very important for as many languages as possible to be preserved. Scientists have been trying to raise people's awareness on how certain tribes have specific words which cannot be expressed in let's say English simply because there is no equal meaning. Namely, the Yupik of Alaska have 99 names to describe different layers of ice formation, or how the Tofa of Siberia classify reindeer . In other words, when languages die out, mankind's wisdom reduces. On a happier note, there are many famous cases which show what can be done to preserve languages in danger of extinction. In particular, the Maori in New Zealand have created socalled ""language nests"": organizations which help children under five learn the language. They provide them with a setting where they are exposed to the language intensively so that they get to realise that communicating in Maori is as natural as communicating in English. There is always, of course, the risk that the children won't keep the language alive after they have left their ""nests"". Nevertheless, hope dies hard."	['Foreign languages were spoken.']

Although it is quite common for Chinese people to dream of a developed China, most people also have their own dreams. I interviewed several young Chinese students with higher US educational backgrounds. They all had their own dreams for their native country. Fred Wang, an MBA student in the US, said, ""I dream of equal chance for the young in China. Equality means all young people can compete fairly, based on the rule-of-law no matter whether they are rich or poor."" Yujie Zhao, another MBA student in California, said, ""I dream of having the best education for my children so they will not lose at the starting line, and I dream of being able to take good care of my parents after they return home from work.""

. The main purpose of the passage is _ .	"Cities need to put efforts to deal with pollution and clear the air. Chinese cities will need to put efforts to clear up the sky when a new department to improve regional air quality is set up by 2015, according to the latest plan released by the State Council. Besides the existing pollution control program for SO2, regional emission caps for other certain chemicals will be established in the three key air polluting areas-- the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Coal-consumption caps will also be tried out in some areas, according to the plan. ""The plan is aimed at dealing with regional air pollution--such as acid rain and smog--which have become increasingly obvious in China in recent years and caused a severe threat to people's health,"" Zhang Lijun, vice-minister of environmental protection, said in an interview on Monday. ""The air quality in a city affects the regions nearby because pollutants Can travel through the atmosphere,"" said Chai Fahe, vice-director of Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences. ""So efforts to reduce air pollution in a single city, targeting a certain pollutant will not be enough,"" Chai said. Zhang said, ""The country's major industrial districts--the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region--have recorded more than 100 misty days annually in recent years."" These three regions, home to at least 200 million people, occupy only 6. 3 percent of the country's area but consume 40 percent of the country's coal and produce half of its steel, according to official figures. Studies also show that the visibility in eastern regions of China has dropped by 7 to 15 km compared to that in the early 1960s, as a result of air pollution. Liaoning province, the Shandong Peninsula, Wuhan in Hubei province and its surrounding area, the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan region in Hunan province, the Chengdu-Chongqing region, and the western coast of the Taiwan Straits are also listed as areas to carry out such regional air pollution control programs, according to the plan. The new plan also requires an improved air quality system, which will measure the pollution levels. ""The current system, which only measures some major pollutants, cannot reflect ."" said Chai."

Edmund Halley figured out the orbit of _ .	Edmund Halley was an English scientist who lived over 200 years ago. He studied the observations of comets which other scientists had made. The orbit of one particular comet was a very difficult mathematical problem. He could not figure it out. Neither could other scientists who dealt with such problems. However, Halley had a friend named Isaac Newton, who was a brilliant mathematician. Newton thought he had already worked out that problem, but he could not find the papers on which he had done it. He told Halley that the orbit of a comet had the shape of an ellipse . Now Halley set to work. He figured out(,)the orbits of some of the comets that had been observed by scientists. He made a surprising discovery. The comets that had appeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682 all had the same orbit. Yet their appearance had been 75 to 76 years apart. This seemed very strange to Halley. Three different comets followed the same orbit. The more Halley thought about it, the more he thought that there had not been three different comets as people thought. He decided that they had simply seen the same comet three times. The comet had gone away and had come back again. It was an astonishing idea! Halley felt certain to make a prediction of what would happen in the future. He decided that this would appear in the year 1758. There were 53 years to go before Halley's prediction could be tested. In 1758 the comet appeared in the sky. Halley did not see it, for he had died some years before. Ever since then that comet had been called Halley's comet, in his honor.	['the same comet appearing at different times']
What can be inferred from the passage?	"Watching a child struggle to breathe during as asthma attack is frightening for any parent. So it is only natural that most moms and dads will try just about anything, including spending a lot of money -to keep an attack at bay. Trouble is, more than half of parents are trying strategies that simply do not work and wasting hundreds of dollars in the process. According to Dr. Machael Cabana, a pediatrician at the prefix = st1 /UniversityofMichigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, who led the study, one of the most common mistakes was to buy mattress cover to protect against dust mites for a child whose asthma instead was made by plant pollen . Many of those parents then neglected to do what would have helped a lot more; shut the windows to keep pollen out. Another was using a humidifier for a child who was allergic to dust mites; a humidifier tends to be a place where dust mites like to breed. With those allergies, a dehumidifier works better. Worst of all was the number of smokers with asthmatic children who didn't even try to quit or at least limit themselves to smoking outdoors rather than just moving to another room or the garage. Many smoking parents purchased expensive air filters that have what Cabana called "" questionable utility. "" Part of the problem, Dr. Caban and his colleagues believe, is that parents are bombarded by television ads that encourage them to buy products such as air and carpet fresheners, ionizers and other remedies that are often expensive but medically unnecessary. And doctors may not always take the time, or have the time, to explain to parents what will and won't work in their child's particular case. For example, allergies are usually a problem for older children with asthma, while kids 5 and younger more frequently have trouble with viral repiratory infections. So make sure you understand what the cause of your child's asthma really is."	['The best solutions are not always the most expensive ones.']

"Why does Hamburg launch the ""car-free"" program?"	"The German city of Hamburg has announced plans to become car-free within the next two decades. It is an ambitious idea, but city officials obviously feel that the personal motorcar does not fulfill a function that walking, biking and taking public transport cannot. The goal of Hamburg's project is to replace roads with a green network, which will allow people to navigate through the city without the use of cars. Banishing the car from urban areas is becoming a common trend in many European cities. London imposes a ""congestion charge"" on private vehicles entering the city centre during rush hours. Copenhagen is building bicycle superhighways radiating out from the city centre. These developments combined may make worrying reading for driving enthusiasts. Is the time of the personal car over? In the century since the Ford Model T was introduced in 1908, global vehicle numbers have swollen to well over a billion. But according to recent research, the growth may have stopped. According to Professor Michael Sivak, at the University of Michigan, ""motorization"" in the US might have reached a peak in 2008, and that the figures have been on the decline since. ""New York, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, each have more than thirty percent of households without a light duty vehicle,"" says Sivak. In fact, the figures show that fifty-six percent of households in New York (which top the list) don't have a car. ""I think that will be surprising to most people. It was surprising to me, and I am in the business. "" Sivak thinks a number of factors could be contributing to the trend, including workingfrom home and the movement of populations back to city centers. In China, Beijing and Shanghai are looking at plans to limit the number of new vehicles being registered to control prouth. It's a movement more cities are looking towards, particularly in the US."

A characteristic of the new age mentioned in the passage is that _ .	A new age is coming.Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society.It all translates to a fundamental change in the way we work.Already we're partly there, the percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World.Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise.More women are in the work force than ever before.There are more part-time jobs.More people are self-employed.But the range of the economic transformation can't be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to important new way of thinking about the nature of work itself.Long-held ideas about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers - all these are being challenged. We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead.No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip , would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots.Tomorrow's achievements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence or even some still unimagined technology could produce a similar wave of dramatic changes.But one thing is certain: information and knowledge will become even more valid, and the people who possess it, whether they work in manufacturing or services, will have the advantage and produce the wealth.Computer knowledge will become as basic a requirement as the ability to read and write.The ability to solve problems by applying information instead of performing routine tasks will be valued above all else.If you cast your mind ahead 10 years, information service will be superior.It will be the way you do your job.

The students felt unhappy because _ .	Basketball is still a young game. It's over a hundred years old. In the winter of 1891, a certain college was having some trouble with its boy students. The weather was bad and the students had to stay indoors. As they couldn't play outdoors, they were unhappy, and some even got into fights from time to time. Some of the teachers, at the college asked Dr. Naismith to invent a game so that the students might have something to play with. It was not easy to invent such a game because it had to be played indoors , and the court was not very large. Dr. Naismith thought for a few days and invented a kind of ball game. It was a fast, wonderful game with much moving and passing of the ball. It was played between two teams. To make a score , the ball had to be thrown into the basket ten feet above the floor on the wall . At each end of the court there was such a basket. At first, Dr. Naismith wanted to throw the ball into a box. As he could not find boxes of the right size, he had to use fruit baskets instead. That is how the game got its name.

Which is the theory the scientists believe in?	"You've probably seen it before-two elderly people walking hand in hand down the street and looking very much like each other. They look so much alike that they could be brother and sister. Do you believe that people who live together for many years would look alike? It's strange. but scientists say it's true. How scientists proved it? In a study, scientists found young couples only showed similarity by chance. However, elder couples were very likely to look like each other. The similarity could be very subtle and could be found in wrinkles or furrows, etc. Besides, some couples look far more alike than other couples. The scientists thought of several possible reasons: 1. Diet. ""We are what we eat."" As couples usually share the same diet, will they probably look alike? For example, if both partners eat a high fat diet, their faces will tend to look fat. However, the scientists ruled this out using another small study. 2. Environment. Will elderly couples show similarity because they live together in the same area for a long time? The environmental factors such as sunshine and wind affect the skin in similar ways. The scientists ruled this possibility out as well. 3. Empathy . This is the theory the scientists believe in. Couples grow to look similar because they are empathizing with each other. They copy each other's facial expressions. For example, if one partner often smiles in a certain way, the other is likely to copy it. In this way, their faces share similar wrinkles and furrows."

What's the author's attitude towards traditional fairytales?	"Traditional fairytales are being abandoned by parents because they are too horrible for their young children, a study found. Research revealed one in five parents dislike old classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Rapunzel and are in favor of more modern books. One third of parents said their children have been left in tears after hearing the horrible details of Little Red Riding Hood. And nearly half of mothers and fathers refuse to read Rumplestiltskin to their kids as the themes of the story are about kidnapping and crimes. Similarly, Goldilocks and the Three Bears was also a tale likely to be left on the book shelf as parents felt it forgives stealing. The survey of 2,000 adults was conducted to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM, which starts tonight at 9pm on Watch, and sees six episodes based on traditional fairytales. The survey found a quarter of parents questioned wouldn't consider reading a fairytale to their child until they had reached the age of five, as they prompt too many awkward questions from their children. Steve Hornsey, General Manager of Watch, said: ""Bedtime stories are supposed to calm down children and send them off to sleep soundly. But as we see in GRIMM, fairytales can be dark and dramatic tales so it's understandable that parents worry about reading them to young children."" ""As adults we can see the innocence in fairytales, but a five-year-old child with an over active imagination could take things too seriously. Despite the dark nature of classic fairytales, as we see in GRIMM, good will triumph over evil and there is always a moral to the story."" The study also found two thirds of mums and dads try to avoid stories which might give their children nightmares. However, half of parents said traditional tales are more likely to have a strong moral message than a lot of modern kids' books, such as The Gruffalo, The Hungary Caterpillar and the Mr. Men books."

What was Elvis' music style like most?	"One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the rock & roll music popular all over the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960 s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing, and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was young, Elvis moved from Toledo to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school. But he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called ""country and western"". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music which black people used to sing in the American South. It was called ""blues"". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis became famous around the country. Later Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films such as Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it difficult to live with success. Like many other famous people, He began to take drugs and his health started to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977,his many millions of fans were shocked. ""The King Is Dead!"" the newspaper said. But today his memory and his music live on and will always be remembered as the King of Rock & roll."

Which of the following may be the best title for the passage?	The concept of solar power satellites, or SPS, first put forward in the 1960s, is still not widely known by the general public. For example, at many public exhibitions about energy, SPS is not even mentioned. This is mainly because very little money has been spent on SPS research There are people who claim that SPS is unrealistic - because launch costs are much too high today; or because it is too far away. So why do we believe that it is important to continue to do researches on SPS? The reason is very simple. Humans are going to need huge amounts of electric power in coming decades. Within 50 years the world population is expected to double, while economic growth will continue around the world, especially in the poorer countries. But existing energy sources already face serious problems. They are limited; they are polluted; they are dangerous. So 50 or 100 years from now, where is our power going to come from? Nobody knows. And so we believe that new large-scale possibilities should be studied further. We must remember that humans have some choices concerning our future. To some extent we can choose the direction in which our civilization develops. And choices that are made in the coming decades - such as the energy sources that we will or will not use, will have major, long-term meaning for human life on earth. We believe that if research continues to show that SPS is environmentally and economically attractive, SPS will open the door to a much more attractive future for human civilization than any ground-based energy source, and one that the public will support and that young people will find challenging and exciting. Furthermore energy from SPS can be readily used in developing countries, as the SPS 2000 project will show, thus aiding economic development worldwide. In addition, by creating large commercial fund for space engineering, SPS will open the frontier of space to economic development, thus creating a limitless new field for the growth of the world economy.

The passage focuses on _ .	Everyone agrees that it's necessary to reduce carbon emissions around the world. There is less agreement over exactly how nations should go about achieving a more carbon - free planet. Thus, the environmental equivalent: cap - and - trade carbon emissions, or place a carbon tax on all users? With cap - and - trade programs, governments limit the level of carbon produced by an industry. Companies that hold their emissions below the _ can sell their remaining allowance on a carbon market, while companies that go beyond their limit must purchase credits on that market. Carbon taxes are more straightforward: a set tax rate is placed on the consumption of carbon with the idea that raising the price will encourage industries and individuals to consume less. At the moment, cap-and-trade has the upper hand, but doesn't defeat the tax just yet. Supporters of the tax argue that a cap - and - trade system would be too difficult to administer - and too easily gamed by industries looking to sidestep emissions caps. Cap-and-trade advocates contradict that like all other flat taxes, a carbon collection would relatively burden lower - income families, who spend a greater percentage of their income on energy than rich households. So which system will have a larger effect on carbon consumption? A 10% carbon tax might reduce the demand for carbon about 5 % or less, according to an analysis by the Carbon Tax Center, an environmental advocacy group. That may not be enough. Businesses and governments haven't figured out how the two competing systems can work together, but in the end, the world may need both.	['systems of reducing carbon emissions']

Here's an area of science for everyone, and these cool new books might inspire you to discover your inner scientist. Scaly Spotted Feathered Frilled by Catherine Thimmesh, 58 pages, ages 9-12 Seeing a picture or a model of a dinosaur, do you wonder how anybody knows what they look like? After all, nobody has seen a living dinosaur. This book explains how scientists and artists work together to re-create dinosaurs. As scientific discoveries have been made, the models have changed. Scientific tests may one day expose what a dinosaur's coloring was, but now artists have to use their imagination to determine how these huge creatures looked. Beyond the Solar System by Mary Kay Carson, 128 pages, ages 10-13 This book takes readers back to the beginnings of space exploration--thousands of years ago, when people began star observation--and forward to today's search for planets in distant parts of the Milky Way. Along with history lessons, readers get 21 activities, such as making a black hole and creating a model of Albert Einstein's universe using a T-shirt. The activities are perfect for cold winter days. Ultimate Bugopedia by Darlyne Murawski and Nancy Honovich, 272 pages, ages 7 and older If you're always on the lookout for butterflies, this book is for you.

How does Roosegaarde's device function?	"Hong Kong (CNN)--A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device he hopes will suck pollutants from Beijing's smog-covered skies, creating columns of clean air for residents. An electromagnetic field caused by copper coils will pull small pieces in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. ""It's like when you have a balloon which has electricity and your hair goes toward it.Same with the smog,"" says artist Daan Roosegaarde.His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of the capital's parks.With its skies regularly covered by filthy gray smog, Beijing this week announced a series of emergency measures to deal with the problem in public. Roosegaarde says an indoor experiment has already proved it works and he is confident the results--with the help of a team of scientists and engineers--can be copied outside.""Beijing is quite good because the smog is quite low. It's in a valley so there's not so much wind.It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get rid of the smog so you can see the sun again."" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a complete solution to Beijing's serious and terrible air pollution.""This is not the real answer for smog.The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles,"" he says. However, he hopes the project will make a difference by allowing the city's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.""I want to take a park in Beijing, 50m by 50m square, and make it the cleanest park in Beijing,"" he says.He is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used.

To get the card, you need to show that you are a student, get a passport photo, and pay for a little money.	['Days are very long in winter in Britain.']
After graduation from college, many young people _ .	Every year, thousands of new high school graduates pack their bags, move to new cities, and sign papers accepting loans, the money borrowed from a bank or lenders etc, which they might not be able to pay back. Without proper education on personal finance, especially as it relates to paying for college, young adults are guided into improper loan plans that result in years of debt after graduation. In order to set students up to succeed financially, it is important to educate students and parents on their financial options before school in the fall. The best way to support families heading for college is to require that every high school student take a personal finance class before graduation. This will help smooth the transition into adulthood. The average student takes out at least one loan to cover the costs of their education each year. In 2014 the average student graduating from college carried a negative balance of about $20,000 in debt, which often spread over multiple lenders. Upon graduation, students rarely know exactly how much money they owe, and even though they are in the state of being unable to pay their debts, they cannot wipe out student loans. These students spend much of their adult lives paying off the gradual increasing debts. A personal finance course would teach students how to manage their income and expenditures, while helping to significantly reduce the amount of debt students carry into adulthood. By teaching students how to save money and live within their means, this course will provide the next generation with a foundation to progress financially. Students choosing to get a job straight out of high school would also benefit from finance education for these very reasons. With education on how to manage their finances, all young people will have the knowledge to make healthy decisions, leading them to improve good credit and purchase needed items like cars and homes with skill and confidence. While not every young person makes financial mistakes, those who do can face years of difficulty trying to get their finances back under control. Rather than help them through these hard times when they happen, we should try to prevent them from happening at all. Making the completion of personal finance coursework a requirement for graduation would ensure that young people are at least aware of the basics of preserving a financial stability.

Under which circumstance will an alert message not be sent?	"Federal regulators Wednesday approved a plan to create a nationwide emergence alert system using text messages delivered to cell phones. Text messages have exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly among young people. The wireless industry's trade association, CTIA, estimates more than 48 billion text messages are sent each month. The plan comes from the Warning Alert and Response Network Act, a 2006 federal law that requires improvements to the nation's emergency alert system. The act tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with coming up with new ways to alert the public about emergencies. ""The ability to deliver accurate and timely warnings and alerts through cell phones and other mobile services is an important next step in our efforts to help ensure that the American public has the information they need to take action to protect themselves and their families before, and during, disasters and other emergencies,"" FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said following approval of the plan. Participation in the alert system by carriers--telecommunications companies is voluntary, but it has received solid support from the wireless industry. The program would be optional for cell phone users. They also may not be charged for receiving alerts. There would be three different types of messages, according to the rules. The first would be a national alert from the president, likely involving a terrorist attack or natural disaster. The second would involve ""approaching threats,"" which could include natural disasters like hurricanes or storms or even university shootings. The third would be reserved for child abduction emergencies, or so-called Amber Alerts. The service could be in place by 2014."	['A child loses his way.']
According to the author's understanding, what is A1 Gore's view on global warming?	"Global warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the 21st century, but--regardless of whether it is or isn't -- we won't do much about it. We will argue over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed. Al Gore calls global warming an ""inconvenient truth,"" as if merely recognizing it could put us on a path to a solution. But the real truth is that we don't know enough to relieve global warming, and--without major technological breakthroughs--we can't do much about it. From 2003 to 2050, the world's population is estimated to grow from 6.4 billion to 9.1 billion, a 42% increase. If energy use per person and technology remain the same, total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (mainly, CO2) will be 42% higher in 2050. But that's too low, because societies that grow richer use more energy. We need economic growth unless we condemn the world's poor people to their present poverty and freeze everyone else's living standards. With modest economic growth, energy use and greenhouse emissions more than double by 2050. No government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and personal freedom (limits on electricity usage, driving and travel) that might cut back global warming. Still, politicians want to show they're ""doing something."" Consider the Kyoto Protocol . It allowed countries that joined to punish those that didn't. But it hasn't reduced CO2 emissions (up about 25% since 1990), and many signatories didn't adopt tough enough policies to hit their 2008-2012 targets. The practical conclusion is that if global warming is a potential disaster, the only solution is new technology. Only an aggressive research and development program might find ways of breaking our dependence on fossil fuels or dealing with it. The trouble with the global warming debate is that it has become a moral problem when it's really an engineering one. The inconvenient truth is that if we don't solve the engineering problem, we're helpless."	['It is a problem that can be solved once it is recognized.']
This passage might be written to _ .	Every day on the road, accidents are caused. They do not only happen. The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work.	['ordinary citizens']
To attend a formal banquet, you _ .	"Banquets are usually held in restaurants in private rooms that have been reserved for the purpose. You will be met at the door and led to the banquet room. Traditionally, the head of your delegation should enter the room first. Do not be surprised if your hosts greet you with a loud round of applause. The proper response is to applaud back. Seating arrangements are stricter than in the West. Guests should never assume that they may sit where they please and should wait for hosts to guide them to their places. Traditionally, the Chinese regard the right side as the superior and the left side as the inferior. Therefore on formal occasions, the host invariably arranges for the main guests to sit on his right side. It is the host's responsibility to serve the guests, and at very formal banquets people do not begin to eat until the host has served a portion to the principal guest. Or, the host may simply raise his chopsticks and announce that eating has begun. After this point, one may serve oneself any food in any amount. Remember to go slow on eating. Don't fill yourself up when five courses are left to go. To stop eating in the middle of a banquet is rude, and your host may incorrectly think that something has been done to offend you. Drinking takes an important place in Chinese banquets. It is likely that the host will stand and hold his glass out with both hands while saying a few words. When he says the words ""gan bei"",which means bottoms up, all present should drain their glasses. After this initial toast, drinking and toasting are open to all. No words are needed to make a toast, and it is not necessary to drain your glass, although to do so is more respectful. When filling another glass, it is polite to fill it as full as you can. This symbolizes full respect and friendship. When the last dish is finished, the banquet has officially ended. There is little ceremony involved with its conclusion. The host may ask if you have eaten your fill. Then the principal host will rise, signaling that the banquet has ended. Generally, the principal host will bid good evening to everyone at the door and stay behind to settle the bill with the restaurateur. Other hosts usually accompany guests to their vehicles and remain outside waving until the cars have left the premises."	['should applaud back when greeted with a loud round of applause .']
"""I can't help myself"" means _ ."	"Good health is the most precious thing in the world .When you have got it, you never think about it. When you haven't got it , you think about it all the time. Our biggest enemies are not terrible diseases. We are our own biggest enemies because we sometimes destroy our own good health. Some of us eat too much, drink too much and smoke too much. And though our reason tells us we should control ourselves, we find it difficult. The fact is that most human beings need stimulation. Who doesn't enjoy a drink after a busy day? Only a smoker knows the pleasure of a cigarette with a cup of coffee. The danger is when these innocent pleasures run our lives and so destroy our health. When you find yourself eating between meals or eating too much rich food, when you can only keep yourself going by taking frequent drinks or by smoking one cigarette after another, then it's time to stop and think what you might be doing to yourself. The funny thing is that when we don't control ourselves, simple pleasures are no longer simple pleasures. All right, I know what you're thinking. You're probably saying: ""It's all very well for him to talk, but I can't help myself. I need that extra bit of food, that extra drink, that extra cigarette. Life has so many pressures that I can't manage without them."" But I'm saying you can help yourself. Not only that you must help yourself. Because if you don't help yourself, no one else can. So be your own best friend ."	"[""I can't control myself""]"

What can you know from the passage?	"A group of fifteen-year-old students at Sunshine School are holding a charity sale to raise money to help their classmate Lisa. Lisa had cerebral palsy when she was a baby. People who have cerebral palsy have trouble walking. Although Lisa has to use a wheelchair to help her get around, she never gives up. And she is always ready to help others. ""Lisa has the chance of standing up, but she needs an operation which will cost lots of money."" Lisa's doctor said. ""I never thought that I could stand up one day. Actually the news is surprising for me. However, when I see my parents are worried about the cost of the operation, I am sad. I am used to my life. I don't mind if I can't stand up."" Lisa said. ""Now my classmates and some other kind people are helping me. I am really thankful. If I stood up one day, I could try my best to help more people."" ""While helping Lisa, we can also learn a lot. We have learned how to cook cookies and how to sell them,"" Betty, one of Lisa's classmates said.

""We have raised about $2,100 so far. We hope we will raise more money for Lisa's operation."" he said."	['Lisa is lucky because many people are helping her.']
The mouth may make your weakness known by _ according to the passage.	"Most good interviewers will make an effort to establish and keep eye contact. Make sure that you do not find yourself looking down or away. If you wear glasses, be sure to buy the non-glare lenses. Do not stare. Rapidly nodding your head can leave the impression that you are impatient and too eager to add something to the conversation -- if only the interviewer would let you. Slower nodding, on the other hand, emphasizes interest, shows that you are validating the comments of your interviewer, and encourages him to continue. Tilting the head slightly, when combined with eye contact and a natural smile, shows friendliness and approachability . Your smile is one of the most powerful positive body signals. Everybody looks better when they smile. Offer an unforced, confident smile. Avoid at all costs the technique that some applicants use: grinning idiotically for the length of the interview, no matter what. This will only communicate that you are insincere . It's worth remembering that the mouth provides a seemingly limitless supply of opportunities to convey weakness. This may be done by touching the mouth frequently; ""faking"" a cough when confused with a difficult question; and /or gnawing on one's lips absentmindedly . Employing any of these ""insincerity signs"" when you are asked about say, why you lost your last job, will confirm or instill _ about your honesty."	['pretending to be coughing']
The author glanced at the cashier because of _ .	"One day I was waiting in line to check out at Wal-Mart. Like a lot of people who want to get through a checkout line, my thoughts were on speed, nothing more. The line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier. There stood a man in his seventies. Of average build, he wore glasses and a nice smile. I thought, ""Well, he's an old guy and it probably takes him a little longer to get the chores done."" For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before he began scanning the items they were purchasing. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation. I thought it was strange, but I guess I had grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of a robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,'' and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!'' This old cashier had my attention. He seemed genuine about wanting to know how people were feeling. And after giving them the change, the old cashier looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today, ''he told them. ""You will have a great day. Bye-bye."" The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some shy grins .All had been touched by his simple gesture in a place they never expected."	['the slow speed of the checkout line']

Would one of you mind doing this for me?"" His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything. But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went to her son's room silently and cut the trousers by two inches. She came back without saying anything to her daughters. After supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She went to his room and cut the trousers by two inches without saying anything to anyone. The younger sister went to the cinema.

Which of the following countries has the fewest World Heritage places?	"The Global Heritage Fund organization recently released a list of cultural treasures in the developing world that are in danger of disappearing. These""On the Verge"" places face many threats. They included war, development pressures, stealing and misuse by visitors. The Global Heritage Fund says these places are important because they are records of our human civilization. And the group says countries can learn to use these treasures to help support responsible development in the future. One such place is the town of Lamu. Lamu was once a very important trading center in East Africa. This ancient city became part of the United Nations Heritage list in 2001. But it still faces threats. For example, a modern port might be built nearby. Other endangered places include Ani, a city in Turkey, the town of Maluti in India, the ancient city of Ninevah in northern Iraq, the Sans-Souci palace in Haiti, and the former capital of Ayutthaya in Thailand. The Global Heritage Fund is nonprofit organization based in California. The group says it only focuses on developing countries which often have few resources to protect places of cultural importance. And, other major cultural organizations often pay more attention to protecting places in the developed world. For example, the fund points out the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has forty-five World Heritage places in Italy. UNESCO has forty-two in Spain. But Peru, famous for its ancient Incan buildings, has only nine World Heritage places. Guatemala has only three. The Global Heritage Fund says its new report tries to place a value on cultural places so that they can also be considered as economic resources. It estimates that by 2025 these places of cultural importance could produce one hundred billion dollars a year in income for developing countries."	['Guatemala']

According to the passage, all of these can be used to save water except _ .	Saving water is an important part of going _ . As water becomes less and polluted more, conservation becomes more and more important. The less water you use, the less wastewater will end up in our rivers and lakes. Wasting water means that more water needs to be treated and cleaned, a process that requires quite a lot of energy. As it is said above, cutting down on water usage is one of the most important things you can do for your local environment and the planet as a whole. That is why more green households are going blue: cutting down their water footprint by conserving and harvesting water. It may seem like a big concept, but going blue starts with small changes that everyone can make. Something as simple as turning off the tap while you brush your teeth can save a lot of water. Wash your fruits and vegetables in a bowl rather than under a tap to save even more. Make sure that the taps are fully turned off every time you step away from the sink or the shower -- all those little drips can add up to a lot of water waste. Another way of reducing your water footprint is reducing your dependence on the main water supply. Rainwater harvesting can meet a lot of your home's water needs. Many of us already practice rainwater harvesting in a small way. Collecting water from your gutters is a great way to keep your garden green without running the sprinkler .

The writer's purpose for writing this article is to _ .:]	"By today's standards, my mobile phone is pretty rubbish. It's a Nokia 1616. If that doesn't mean much to you ( it's not the kind of phone you see advertised on television) ,all you need to know is that it's a small, not very heavy device with which you can send and receive telephone calls and text messages. It also has a very handy torch on the top for when you can't find your keys, or when you drop something on the floor in the cinema. Apart from that, my phone doesn't do much. Well, it has an alarm, and it probably has a calculator and things like that, but it's nothing compared to a smartphone. Why would I want one of those? I have often been told that the big advantage of having a smartphone is that "" you can do everything with them!"" But when was the last time you saw someone doing ""everything"" with a smartphone? Okay, so they may have an endless list of functions, but generally they are used for checking social networking sites, playing games, and receiving and replying to emails. I'm happy just doing all of those things at home on my laptop. As far as I can tell, the best thing about having a smartphone is that you can be connected to the internet all the time. Don't get me wrong, I love the internet, but I just don't see the point of constantly being online. I can't remember the last time I received a Facebook update which was so urgent that I had to read it as soon as it appeared, and I can't imagine ever having a job which was so important that I would need to read work-related emails immediately. I would think that if someone needed me urgently, they would just ring me rather than send an email. And my trusty Nokia can manage that. One of the most peculiar effects of the smartphone is, in my opinion, the newly-found addiction to maps and navigation systems. Is there anything more boring than knowing exactly where you are all of the time? How do you get to know an area if you don't get lost there a few times? And if you are dependent on online maps, what happens to those great places you find just by chance? You can't exactly find out from google maps the journey from ""here"" to ""that hidden cafe with the tasty-looking cakes"", or to ""that pond next to the church which looks really pretty in the evening sun. "" It is, of course, true that we all occasionally need to be pointed in the right direction, but I find that there are often real life humans you can ask. There are many benefits of having a very basic mobile phone, like the face that it cost me about twenty pounds, and that I don't have to worry too much about it being stolen. But the main benefit has to be the fact that it provides me with the world's greatest excuse for my bad habits. Whether it's turning up late to events, or getting lost on a trip, or missing buses or trains, or forgetting about an appointment at work. I'm pretty sure I'm covered with the following explanation ""I'm really sorry, but I don't have a smartphone."""	"[""explain why he doesn't want a smartphone""]"
What caused my younger sister to smile and hug dad strongly?	"When I was young, my father used to grow carnations -- a kind of flower that was red, pink or white. He took care of them with much love and devotion. Every day he came home from work, he would enjoy watching them. And he used to tell us, ""No one should touch my flowers."" One day, my younger sister Clemence, who loved dad very much, wanted to help him. So she cut the carnation from their stems one by one and arranged them on the ground. She believed that dad would be very happy to see them that way. When mom and I realized what my sister had done, we became completely silent. However, my sister didn't know why no one showed her any appreciation . When dad arrived, he went as usual straight to watch the flowers. Seeing his flowers lying on the ground like dead animals, he was shocked at first. He looked towards the street to see if it was any of the neighbors' children who could have done it. Then he looked at mom in silence. Finally mom, who always taught us to tell the truth no matter what, said, ""No bad neighbors did this great job, only your lovely daughter Clemence."" Dad's face changed into a smile and then he said, ""Do I have better flower than my lovely daughter?"" My younger sister smiled and hugged dad strongly. ,."	"[""Dad's words.""]"

We can know from the text _ .	"Deadly heat waves, home-wrecking hurricanes, neighborhood-burning wildfires...When you stop to think about it, global warming can be thoroughly depressing. According to rising evidence, climate changewon't just cause new cases of stress, anxiety and depression. People who already have serious psychological problems will probably suffer most in the result of natural disasters and extreme weather events. ""When these events happen, people with pre-established mental illnesses often have more extreme difficulty,"" said Lisa Page, a psychiatrist. ""This is an area we maybe need to think about a little more seriously."" In public health circles and even in climate talks, scientists have studied how climate change might affect physical health, by for example, causing the spread of malaria, fever and other infectious diseases. For the most part, though, the experts have made only vague references to the link between climate change and mental health, even though evidence for such connections is starting to pile up. In the future, climate models predict more destructive storms, floods, droughts and diseases. In turn, the new study suggests, more psychological crises will follow. Heat waves -- like the one that killed some 70,000 people in Europe in the summer of 2003 -- will also happen more frequently, last longer and be severer in coming years. The mentally ill will be hardest hit by these events because they're more likely to live in poor housing without air conditioning. People with pre-existing mental challenges will probably also have an extra hard time dealing with other forecasted consequences of climate change, including the sinking of coastlines and mass migration away from flooded shores. Then, there's the general sense of sadness that can come from reading about climate change, and recognizing that the world is changing."

The text mainly advises people _ .	"Sleeping in on Saturday after a few weeks of too little shuteye may feel refreshing, but it can give a false sense of security. New research shows long-term sleep loss cannot be cured that easily. Scientists researched the effects of short- and long-term sleep loss and found that those who suffer long-term sleep loss may function normally soon after waking up, but experience steadily slower reaction times as the day goes by, even if they had tried to catch up the previous night. The research has important safety significances in an increasingly busy society, not just for shift-workers but for the roughly one in six Americans who regularly get six hours or less of sleep a night. ""We know that staying awake 24 hours without sleep will affect your performance to do all sorts of things, and this effect equals to drinking too much when driving,"" said lead researcher Dr. Daniel Cohen of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. But when those who suffer long-term sleep loss become all-nighters, ""the harm is increased ten times,"" Cohen said. The National Institutes of Health says adults need seven hours to nine hours of sleep for good health. Regularly getting too little sleep increases the risk of health problems, including memory impairment and a weakened immune system. More immediately, too little sleep affects reaction times; sleepiness is to blame for car crashes and other accidents. It has critically important complicated and unexpected results for anyone who works ""crazy hours"" and thinks they are performing fine with a few hours of weeknight sleep, said Harris, director at New York's Montefiore Medical Center. ""Don't think you can just _ your sleep on the weekend, because it doesn't work that way,"" he warned."	['to sleep scientifically']
What was not the life of young British people in the past? _ .	"Life used to be fun for ""teenagers"". They used to have money to spend, and free time to while away. They used to wear teenage clothes, and meet in teenage coffee bars and discos. Some of them still do. But for many young people, life is harder now. Jobs are difficult to find. There's not so much money around. Things are more expensive, and it's hard to find a place to live in. Teachers say that students work harder than they used to. They are less interested in politics, and more interested in passing exams. They know that good exam results may bring them better jobs. Most young people worry more about money than their parents did twenty years ago. They try to spend less and save more. They want to be able to get homes of their own one day. For some, the answer to unemployment is to leave home and look for jobs in one of Britain's big cities. Every day hundreds of young people arrive in London from other parts of Britain, looking for jobs. Some find jobs, and stay. Others don't, and go home again, or join the unemployed in London. When you read the newspapers and watch the news on television, it's easy to get the idea that British young people are all unemployed, angry and in trouble. But that's not true. Three quarters of them do more or less what their parents did. They do their best at school, find some kinds of jobs in the end, and get married in their early twenties. They get on well with their parents, and enjoy their family life. After all, if they don't, they won't be British, will they?"	['They had not much money to spend']
When a gentleman and his girlfriend went into the restaurant, the waiter would give _ a beautiful menu.	The food in White Rose Restaurant was cheap and good, but nobody seemed to want to eat there. There were very few people going to eat there. The owner was very worried about it. Then he thought of a good idea. A few weeks later, his restaurant was always full of men and their girlfriends. Whenever a gentleman came with a lady, a kind waiter would give each of them a beautiful menu. The menus looked exactly the same on the outside, but there was an important difference inside. The menu that the waiter handed to the man gave the correct price for each dish and each bottle of wine, while the menu that he handed to the lady gave a much higher price! So when the man calmly ordered dish after dish and wine after wine, the lady thought he was much more generous than he really was! The man could make a good impression on the lady.	['each of them']
Why did Jane shout loudly in the restaurant?	"I believe children have a very pure sense of humor. Well, I would like to share my experiences with you. The other day when I was out with a friend and her daughter Jane at a restaurant, Jane ordered an apple dessert, which was the most attractive dish in that restaurant. However, when she had a bite of the pie, she shouted loudly, ""Mom, why does it look good but tastes like rubber?"" My friend was uneasy. Then the waiter gave us another dish. A child can say funny things. I was at a friend's home for tea and her son, Mark, wanted her to get up. His mom replied, ""I can't, because my foot has fallen asleep now."" Little Mark then sang a song and asked, ""Mom, will it wake up now?"" We laughed together. The other day we were having an interesting conversation over lunch and my friend, an animal activist , was arguing with another group member. Her son Tommy suddenly stood up, ""Mom, people should never be allowed to shoot extinct animals!"" That was funny and the child did manage to turn the argument into a pleasant conversation. Well, children sometimes really surprise us. I think we can have a lot to learn from them. They can help us understand the simple world through their eyes."

What do we learn about Tivoli Gardens?	It's a good time for a theme park, according to a report. There was a four percent growth in the number of visitors to theme parks in 2014 compared with 2013. There were a total of 223,450,000 visits to the top 25 theme parks in 2014. But even extreme enthusiasts may not be able to get to every park on the top-25 list. Here are six theme parks that are less known to Americans. But they're truly worth a visit. Ocean Park Hong Kong's Ocean Park is a marine mammal park, animal theme park and amusement park. It came in at No.13 on the top-25 list. Lotte World Located in Seoul, South Korea, Lotte World is famous for having the world's largest indoor theme park together with an outdoor theme park. It's also home to South Korea's largest ice skating rink. It was ranked No.14 on the top-25 list. Everland Also in South Korea, Everland is located in Gyeonggi-Do. It includes a zoo and a water park and was ranked No.16. Europa Park Europe Park, located in Rust, is the largest theme park in Germany and one of four in Europe to make the top-25 list. It got No.21. Tivoli Gardens When you take into consideration that Tivoli Gardens is closed a few months every year, its spot at No.23 is impressive. Located in Copenhagen, it's famous for its fairy-tale atmosphere and antique roller coaster. De Efteling De Efteling is a fantasy-themed amusement park in Katsheuvel, the Netherlands. The attractions are based on elements from ancient myths and legends, fairy tales, fables and folklore. It was ranked No.24.	['It cannot be visited all year round.']
If your house is on fire, you must _ .	According to a new survey, student safety has become a big problem. Nearly 50% of students say they are worried about robbery on the way to and from school. Now in many big cities in China, some schools have taught an unusual lesson: self-protection . Students like this lesson because there are no exams or boring classes. And they can learn how to save lives and know how to stop danger before it really happens. Chen Haoyu, a teacher at Beijing No.25 Middle School and a self-protection expert , gives young students advice on how to deal with danger. If you are robbed Keep calm. If you can not cry for help or run away, give the robber your money. Try to remember what the robber looks like and tell the police later. If you are in a traffic accident If a car hurts you, you should remember the car number; if it is a bicycle, try to call your parents before you let the rider go. This is because you don't know how badly you are hurt. If it is raining hard and there is lightning Don't stay in high places and keep away from trees. When there is a fire Get away as fast as you can. Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit . Do not take the lift! If someone is drowning If you can't swim, don't get into the water. Cry out for help. Remember that danger is never as far away as you think. Take care of yourself at all times!	['runawayandfindanexitasquicklyasyoucan']
What does the passage mainly talk about?	"ESP, Extra Sensory Perception, is a catch-all expression for the so-called ability of certain people to receive transmitted thoughts from others, to transmit their own thoughts, to see what will happen in the future or to be able to move objects from one place to another without physically touching them. These special people are called psychics. Some believe that we all have this ability to some degree but that most of us choose not to develop it. Many people are skeptical about ESP. Alongside the existence of documented evidence, there are plenty of claims that have turned out to be cheating. For most people, it is difficult to accept such claims without having had first hand experience. The lack of scientific evidence is another factor to take into account. On the other hand, most of us have, at some time, experienced a seemingly unexplainable occurrence; hearing the telephone ring and knowing who will be on the other end of the line or cases of coincidence that seem to be too extreme to be accidental. Over the years there have been numerous ESP experiments conducted by serious scientists in serious institutions. Joseph Banks Rhine, a botanist at Duke University published a famous book in 1934 called ""Extra-Sensory Perception"" in which he claimed to have enormous evidence of ESP. However, other scientists have been unable to copy his results since, which has resulted in the book losing much of its original credibility and fame. The Ganzfield Experiments are considered to have been the most carefully examined ESP experiments. So-called psychics had their eyes covered and ears blocked while a ""sender"" attempted to transmit messages. Later the psychics would compare the messages received to the original messages sent out. There was a great deal of excitement and interest at the time, but the research failed to produce convincing results. One of the strongest criticisms against ESP is that in order for it to exist, the fundamental laws of physics would necessarily have to be broken. Human beings are attracted to the whole range of supernatural phenomena. ESP will always continue to fascinate. This becomes clear when we see how much of the media is dedicated to the topic: magazines, journals, web sites, television and radio programs. Some of the most successful films in recent years have fuelled interest among the younger generations who are starting to ask the same questions and to look for explanations for the same phenomena as their parents and grandparents before them. Who knows? One day we might just find these answers because one thing is certain: ""The truth is out there! """	['Whether ESP exists.']
Which of the following best expresses the main ides of this selection?	"No one gets through life without experiencing many disappointments. Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth. One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work. Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and ""good times"". The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential. Disappointments are unwelcome, but regular visitors to everyone's life. We can feel depressed about them or we can try to escape from them. The best thing, though, is to accept a disappointment and then try to use it somehow: Step over the unwelcome visitor on the doorstep and get on with life."

Most people want to work, but in today's word ,it is more difficult to find work for everybody.The economics of the world need to grow by 4% each year just to keep the old number of jobs for people. Often this is not possible,and so more people are out of work. Some people have no jobs now because new machines can do the work of many people do in a short time.Also, machines do not ask for more money and longer holidays. In all the countries of the world, machines are taking work from people ,not only in factories but also on the farms. One machine can often do the work of forty people. About 75,000 people are moving to the cities a day to look for jobs ,but only 70% of them can find jobs .	['of the machines']
Which might be the best title of the passage?	"A number of scientific studies have suggested that repeatedly heading a football could increase the risk of developing dementia in later life. In 2002, former England international footballer Jeff Astle died aged 59. A coroner said that Astle died from a brain disease likely to have been caused by ""repeated small damages to the brain"" related to heading a heavy leather football. Dr. Scott Delaney, research director of emergency medicine at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada, has also researched soccer-related head injury and agrees that head-to-head or elbow-to-head blows are the real risk. In 2007, Delaney carried out a study on footballers aged between 12 and 17 that showed they were half as likely to be concussed wearing headgear than without. He said youngsters have a higher risk of head injury than adults because their heads are thinner and less able to absorb shock. To make matters worse, their neck muscles aren't as well developed and they often lack the correct heading technique that can help throw away the force of the ball. Delaney recommends that children wear headgear when playing football and says his two eldest children wear head protection playing the sport. But he admits that children can be unwilling to be the first to wear head protection--especially when their football heroes play without it. While headgear can protect footballers from being concussed during a match, no one knows the long-term effects of repeated ""sub-concussive"" blows to the head. Delaney says that while there is indirect evidence that a career in soccer can lead to dementia, no one has yet found a sure link between the two. He says proving a link would mean monitoring hundreds of footballers for three or four decades--and that would take a lot of funding."	['Playing football may lead to brain damage.']
Who stressed the benefit of reading?	"Several months ago, I attended the opening event for a new children's literacy campaign at the Burbank Library in California. The campaign is called Marvel Comics Close-Up, aimed at using comic books to encourage kids to read. Disney and Marvel donated 210,000 books to libraries and schools across the country. Stars from Disney XD participated. They read Spider-Man comic books to 70 kids from Boys & Girls Clubs in southern California. The stars included Drake Bell (Ultimate Spider-Man), Dylan Riley Snyder (Kickin' It), Olivia Holt (Kickin' It) and Cole Jenson (Crash & Bernstein). Drake Bell said that the Marvel reading campaign is aimed at kids who are bored with books, believing comic books are the answer for kids who say they'd rather play video games. ""Comic books really get you into the story,"" he told TFK(Time For Kids). ""They are not just words or pictures on a page."" Dylan Riley Snyder knows from his experiences that comic books have the power to inspire kids' imagination. His mom was a teacher and she used comic books to interest students who thought they weren't interested in reading. Dylan attended these classes. He would read the comic books and draw the characters along with the students. ""It was a great way for these kids to start to enjoy reading,"" Dylan said. ""That's how I got interested in reading too. Now I can share my love for comic books with others through the Marvel Comics Close-Up program."" David Levine is the Vice President of Disney XD Worldwide. He said great stories and great characters, like Spider-Man and The Avengers, were key to making reading fun. ""Reading can encourage you to explore new things and take you to all sorts of exciting places,"" he told TFK."	['David Levine.']
What is the implication of the story of Stephens,a financial planner in Brooklyn?	"An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget,save and make their own decisions.Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is suitable? Experts say there is not right amount.Actual amounts differ from place to place,and from family to family. To set an appropriate allowance for your child,work up a weekly budget .Allow for entertainment costs such as movies and snacks.Next,include everyday expenses such as lunch money,bus fare,school supplies.""If you make the child responsible for these'ills',""says Josephine Swanson,a consumer specialist,""he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures."" Finally,add some extra money to make saving possible.If you can,keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends.A child whose purchasing power falls away below _ can feel left out. It can be hard,but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance.When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville,her mother gave her $ 5 a week,$1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch.""If you lose your money,""Brooke's mother told her,""you walk home."" One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store,then she called home for a ride.""Mom made me walk home,""recalls Stephens,now a financial planner in Brooklyn.""At first I was angry.But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson."" Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores.Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family.You might,however,pay a child for doing extra jobs at home,which can develop his or her initiative ."

The writer mainly wants to tell us _ .	"Every time I came home from work at midnight, I often saw a shadow walking in our neighborhood. Was it ""a night walking""? Someone walked alone in the dark, and this always made me afraid a lot. I think it was ""a sleep walker"". So I never bothered it. But one night, when I walked past it quietly and quickly as usual, I heard a low voice. ""Do you often have to work at night?"" I was a little afraid. I looked around, but no one was nearby. I ran home as quickly as possible. Later on, I heard it was a neighbor, an old man who has been living alone at home. He's NOT a sleep walker. He enjoys having a walk at night. So I seldom see him in the neighborhood in the day. It's said that he was a soldier many years ago. He has two children, a son and a daughter. His son has a family in Shanghai. His daughter went abroad, in Sydney. He has been living alone since his wife died several years ago. Without any children living with him, he feels lonely and helpless. I feel sorry for the old man. We might care less about our parent who lives alone. When we grow up, our parents get old. We should often go back home even though we're busy with work."

The old man looked _	"An old man walked slowly into a restaurant with his cane . His old jacket and shoes made him unusual that day. A young waitress named Mary watched him move towards a table by the window. She ran over to him, and said with a smile, ""Here, sir. Let me give you a hand."" Without saying a word, he gave her a smile. She pulled the chair away from the table and helped him sit down. Then she put his cane against the table so that he could reach it. In a soft, clear voice, he said, ""Thank you, miss."" ""You're welcome, sir,"" she replied. ""I'll be back in a moment, and if you need anything, just wave at me!"" After he had finished a good meal. Mary brought him the change. She handed him his cane, and walked with him to the front door. Holding the door open for him, she said, ""Come back and see us, sir!"" The old man turned around and smiled. When Mary went to clean his table, she was shocked. Under the plate, she found a business card, a 100-dollar bill and a note. The note said, ""Dear Mary, I respect you very much, and you respect yourself, too. It shows the way you treat others. You have found the secret of happiness."" In fact, the old man was the owner of the restaurant. That was the first time that she, or any of his waitresses, had seen him."	['unusual']
What do we know about the crafts sold on etsy.com?	"Rob Kalin learned the secret to success while he was still in his baby bed. At age one, the Boston-bom teacher's son dragged around a stuffed rabbit that had been lovingly sewn by one of his mother's students. True, one of the ears was sewn on backward, but that just added to its magic. ""It was always special to me,"" Kalin remembers of his first handmade craft . Kalin's appreciation for the simple and the simply eccentric inspired him to create etsy. com, an online craft fair, probably the largest market for handmade goods in the world. Last year, 350,000 woodworkers and other craftsmen sold their one-of-a-kind crafts on the four-year-old site. They sell everything from hand-knit sleeves for Macbooks ($32) to myrtle-wood electric guitars ($3,200). And in an age of chain stores, it seems there's still a big market. More than three million consumers in 150 countries purchased about $87.5 million worth of crafts on Etsy last year. Emily Worden, founder of Elemental Threads, a custom handbag and jewelry company, signed up with Etsy when she started her company two years ago. She pays Etsy a 20-cent standard fee for each item she lists on the site, plus a 3.5 percent commission on everything sold. Etsy allows her to track the number of times customers click on a particular item to view it. ""We can see that our necklaces are a popularly viewed item and which color1s and sizes get the most views,"" she says. ""That is a guide to evolving our product lines."" Today, Etsy's staff has ballooned to 70 employees, and the company reportedly earns more than $12 million a year. Kalin's father was a carpenter and taught him early on how to use his hands. Indeed, in high school, he put his skills to work -- developing the photos of his classmates and handcrafting a graduate ID to attend design classes. Eventually, he was admitted to New York University, studying classics and working as a carpenter. Kalin has also started sewing some of his own clothes.

We can learn from the passage that _ smoking.	I'm glad to find this comment which has some sort of support in this quest I have to eat raw foods. I'm an unhealthy 49 years old and have come to the conclusion that it's now or never, so I am taking a dive into the raw eating lifestyle. I have to cook for my family and prepare what they want to eat. I'm trying to plan out this better so I have some of these unusual foods ready for myself. I've read several books written by Ann Wigmore and like her approach to the living foods. Last week I attempted fasting and failed. I lasted five days by having carrots, spinach, apples and other vegetarian diets I could get my hands on. I was doing fine until I drank some coffee. I kind of proved it in my mind to have the coffee but it only made me excited and then I couldn't sleep well and felt hungry and weak. So I stopped and went back to the old way of eating with the family. This week I started to make a drink called rejuvelac made of sprouted wheat . This is fairly new to do for me and the drink smelled sort of musty and tasted kind of like a musty lemon. The kids tasted it and almost threw up but surprisingly it tasted good to me. It is supposed to help in digestion . I've made some attempts to grow wheat grass. I think I have figured that out as long as I keep it away from birds and our horses. I have two habits to get rid of, drinking coffee and smoking. I quit smoking last month but something happened, so I started up again. I'm very frustrated with the smoking and really have a desire to quit for good. Anyhow I will keep this updated on my progress.	"[""it's hard for the author to quit""]"
What's the feature of traditional rock climbing?	About nine million people like rock climbing in America. Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous. Expert rock climbers say only the very best in the sport should do it.	['It is done outside.']
What can't be learned from the text?	"In a few years,you might be able to speak Chinese,Korean,Japanese,French,and English-and all at the same time. This sounds incredible,but Alex Waibel,a computer science professor at US's Car-negie Mellon University (CMU) and Germany's University of Karlsruhe,announced last week that it may soon be reality. He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other. One application,called Lecture Translation,can easily translate a speech from one language into an-other. Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary. Us-ers also have to be trained how to use the programme. Another machine can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what languagethey speak. ""It is like having a s _ translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you,""Waibel said Prefer to read? So- called Translation Glasses transcribe the translations on a tiny liquid-crystal display(LCD) screen. Then there's the Muscle Translator. Electrodes capture the electrical signals from facial muscle movements made naturally when a person is mouthing words. The signals are then translated into speech.The electrodes could be replaced with wireless chips implanted in a person's face,according to research-ers. During a demonstration held last Thursday in CMU's Pittsburgh campus,a Chinese student named Sang Jun had 11 tiny electrodes attached to the muscles of his cheeks,neck and throat. Then he mouthed-without speaking aloud- a few words in Mandarin to the audience. A few seconds later,the phrase was displayed on a computer screen and spoken out by the computer in English and Spanish: ""Let me introduce our new prototype."" This particular instrument,when fully developed,might allow anyone to speak in any number of lan-guages or,as Waibel put it,""to switch your mouth to a foreign language"". ""The idea behind the universi-ty's prototypes is to create'good enough' bridges for cross- cultural exchanges that are becoming more common in the world,""Waibel said. With spontaneous translators,foreign drivers in Germany could listen to traffic warnings on the radio; tourists in China could read all the signs and talk with local people;leaders of different coun-tries could have secret talks without any interpreters there."

What can you learn from the passage?	As a young woman who was always interested in style, I got lucky in interning with a fashion company in Tokyo, last summer. I worked as an assistant in the Business Planning Department, helping with marketing for the 2007 Spring/Summer collections. Fashion is a beautiful industry. But against my expectation, it also has lots of ordinary work. Every day, I would do sample testing, prepare the brochure for future launches, and meet with customers and visitors. Japanese companies had a traditional work style. We had a meeting every morning at 9 o'clock. Every Monday, all employees, including those in other parts ofprefix = st1 /Japan, would take part in a conference call. Every afternoon, after finishing work, each of us would say goodbye to every manager in the company, which took more than five minutes. All of this kept me fresh. And the strict work atmosphere caused me to work harder. At the end of last August, the company's 2007 Spring/Summer collection started with a big show and was very successful. Lots of customers showed an interest in our products, including a businessman from Hong Kong. He went to our company for more details on the products, but he couldn't speak Japanese and none of the staff spoke good English. Just when the situation seemed helpless, I offered to give it a try. I was a Japanese major, but I had also practiced my English often. My translation job was praised by both the customer and my boss. And the guest made a big purchase. The two-month internship taught me a lot about business. And the pay - 150,000 yen, or over 10,000 yuan a month- was enough to cover my daily living costs inTokyo. Moreover, the experience made me stand out. Every interviewer I've spoken with showed an interest and discussed my internship with me. And thanks to this experience, I've found a good job in one of the Big Four accounting firms and will start working this summer.	['Internship usually plays an important role in finding a good job.']
How does the author feel about robots taking over our jobs?	Imagine that 7 out of 10 working Americans got fired tomorrow. What would they all do? It's hard to believe it would happen. But that is what the industrial revolution did to the labor force of the early 19th century. Two hundred years ago, 70 percent of American workers lived on the farm. Today automation has eliminated all but one percent of their jobs, replacing them with machines. But these workers did not sit, doing nothing. Instead, automation created hundreds of millions of jobs in completely new fields. Those who once farmed were then working in factories that produced farm equipment, cars, and other industrial products. It may be hard to believe, but before the end of this century, _ Yes, dear reader, even you will have your job taken away by machines. In other words, robot replacement is just a matter of time, First, speedy robots being able to lift 150 pounds all day long will carry boxes, sort them, and load them onto trucks. Fruit and vegetable picking will continue to be robotized until no humans pick outside of specialty farms. Next, The work of cleaning in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots. The trucks will be driven by robots. We need to let robots take over. They will do jobs we have been doing, and do them much better than we can. They will do jobs we can't do at all. They will do jobs we never imagined even needed to be done, and they will help us discover new jobs for ourselves and new tasks that expand who we are. They will let us focus on becoming more human than we were.	['Happy.']

What lesson does the writer learn from the story?	"My father and I started our morning by moving quickly into the local store. I waited in the line a the Starbucks counter while he shopped around to pick up a few things. As I was starting there I become aware of an elderly women, with untidy hair,wearing layers upon layers of old clothing, hunchbacked behind me in line. She had a few things for washing and seemed to want the Starbucks cashier to ring up since that queue was shorter than the queues in the store. At some point I became aware of her edging closer behind me -- closer than I was comfortable with! I instinctively placed a hand over my purse and drew it close to me. My fear and imagination raced creating wild stories about this homeless woman who might try to steal from me. Then it was my turn to order. As the cashier rang Ypsilanti my total, I discovered I was 67 cents short. I called my father but he was hard of hearing. He asked me to repeat what I said but he still couldn't make me out. At that point, a long, grey arm, with holes in its sleeves, reached over from behind me. She laid 67 cents out on the counter, saying, ""Here, we all need some help sometimes.

According to Richard, what is the best way to achieve well-being?	"Finding true happiness is a universal aspiration . We all want it, but can we all have it? Genuine happiness is written all over our faces when we are truly contented, and, likewise, a forced smile does nothing to hide underlying sadness. Believing that everyone can create their own lasting joy, Matthieu Richard has been declared the Happiest Man in the World. Richard earned his ""happiest man"" status after a series of laboratory tests in 2004. Richard has shared his thoughts on happiness with a worldwide audience. As an experienced speaker, he has explained his insights into happiness to everyone, from students to corporate groups. Looking inwards to find joy rather than relying on outer conditions, he believes, is the way to achieve well-being. ""It's quite clear that the outer conditions are not enough. The way we interpret those outer conditions in our inner experience is what determines either a sense of well-being or misery. We love to go jogging for fitness and we do all kinds of things to remain beautiful, yet we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most: the way our minds function. It's the essential thing that determines the quality of our experience."" Besides this, Richard stresses that it is not what's happening around us that makes us unhappy, but rather the way we choose to react to it. The pursuit of happiness is becoming a modern obsession . As life becomes more complex, our ability to process our reactions to various outside influences comes under strain. ""Genuine happiness"" he says, ""doesn't mean pleasant feelings one after the other. It's more like a series of qualities that we can develop as skills -- like openness, genuine love, compassion, inner strength and inner peace."""	['Looking inwards to find joy rather than relying on outer conditions.']
We can conclude from the article that _ .	"Up to two-fifths of a food crop is often wasted because it is ""ugly"", a report on food waste has shown. Produce grown in the UK that does not meet retailer standards on appearance is often given to animals or thrown out even though it is healthy to eat. The report from the UK's global food security program also showed that the average household throws away more than 5kg of food a week, and nearly two-thirds of that waste is avoidable. The waste costs PS 480 a year per household on average, and PS 680 per family. Households throw away a fifth of the food they buy, wasting it for reasons ranging from cooking too much to not using it before it goes bad, the study showed. Consumption is the top area where food is wasted in the UK, the study said. Farmers respond to consumer demands for high-quality food with standards that can lead to the crop being wasted. Some supermarkets have started marketing ""odd shapes and sizes"" of fruit and vegetables, though. Also, more UK consumers are prepared to accept ""ugly"" fruit and vegetables, amid concerns over sustainability and food prices, the research said. In developing countries, much of the loss of food occurs during post-harvesting storage, processing and packaging. Tackling waste globally is necessary to feed a growing world population sustainably. One in eight people worldwide doesn't have enough food, the report said. Around a third of food produced globally is lost or wasted. Professor Tim Benton, an expert on food security at the University of Leeds, said: ""Over 5 million people in the UK live in poverty, where basic food provision is a daily challenge."" Nearly 400,000 people used food banks last year, according to the Trussell Trust. ""At the same time, 15 million tons of food is wasted annually, with nearly half thrown away within UK households. Reducing the scale of losses and waste throughout the food system is a crucial step."" The report highlights priorities for research to help reduce food waste, including improving harvesting and packaging technologies and seasonal weather prediction."

What might be the best title for this passage?	"We are not who we think we are. The American self-image is spread with the golden glow of opportunity. We think of the United States as a land of unlimited possibility, not so much a classless society but as a place where class is mutable--a place where brains, energy and ambition are what counts, not the circumstances of one's birth. The Economic Mobility Project, an ambitious research led by Pew Charitable Trusts, looked at the economic fortunes of a large group of families over time, comparing the income of parents in the late 1960s with the income of their children in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Here is the finding: ""The 'rags to riches' story is much more common in Hollywood than on Main Street. Only 6 percent of children born to parents with family income at the very bottom move to the top. That is right, just 6 percent of children born to parents who ranked in the bottom of the study sample, in terms of income, were able to bootstrap their way into the top . Meanwhile, an incredible 42 percent of children born into that lowest are still stuck at the bottom, having been unable to climb a single rung of the income ladder. It is noted that even in Britain---a nation we think of as burdened with a hidebound class system-children who are born poor have a better chance of moving up. When the studies were released, most reporters focused on the finding that African-Americans born to middle-class or upper middle-class families are earning slightly less, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than did their parents. One of the studies indicates, in fact, that most of the financial gains white families have made in the past three decades can be attributed to the entry of white women into the labor force. This is much less true for African-Americans. The picture that emerges from all the quintiles, correlations and percentages is of a nation in which, overall, ""the current generation of adults is better off than the previous one"", as one of the studies notes. The median income of the families in the sample group was $55,600 in the late 1960s; their children's median family income was measured at $71,900. However, this rising tide has not lifted all boats equally. The rich have seen far greater income gains than have the poor. Even more troubling is that our nation of America as the land of opportunity gets little support from the data. Americans move fairly easily up and down the middle rungs of the ladder, but there is ""stickiness at the ends"" --four out of ten children who are born poor will remain poor, and four out often who are born rich will stay rich."

One characteristic of weather maps NOT mentioned by the author in this passage is _ .	"A weather map is an important tool for geographers. A succession of three or four maps presents continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts to determine whether an individual pressure aroa is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity .They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a summary picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time. All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately.Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day""outlook"" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an anaiysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for development of air masses, fronts and storms. Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions, with identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological stations. Extensive experiments are also in progress for weathef modification studies."	['temperature changes']

They are still popular today. He was born in 1564 in England. At school he liked watching plays. He decided to be an actor when he finished school at the age of fourteen. In 1582, he married a farmer's daughter. She was eight years older than he was. Their first child was a daughter .Later they had twins. In1585, Shakespeare left his hometown, Stratford-upon-Avon. His wife and children stayed behind .No one knows why he left or what he did between 1585 and 1592.

The passage is most probably entitled _ .	"When I was superintendent of schools in Palo Alto, California, Polly Tyner, the president of our board of trustees , wrote a letter that was printed in the Palo Alto Times. Polly's son, Jim, had great difficulty in school. He was classified as educationally handicapped and required a great deal of patience on the part of his parents and teachers. But Jim was a happy kid with a great smile that lit up the room. His parents acknowledged his academic difficulties, but always tried to help him see his strengths so that he could walk with pride. Shortly after Jim finished high school, he was killed in a motorcycle accident. After his death, his mother submitted this letter to the newspaper. Today we buried our 20-year-old son. He was killed instantly in a motorcycle accident on Friday night. How I wish I had known when I talked to him last that it would be the last time. If I had only known I would have said, ""Jim, I love you and I'm so very proud of you."" I would have taken the time to count the many blessings he brought to the lives of the many who loved him. I would have taken time to appreciate his beautiful smile, the sound of his laughter, his genuine love of people. When you put all the good attributes on the scale and you try to balance all the irritating _ such as the radio which was always too loud, the haircut that wasn't to our liking, the dirty socks under the bed, etc., the irritations don't amount to much. I won't get another chance to tell my son all I would have wanted him to hear, but, other parents, you do have a chance. Tell your young people what you would want them to hear if you knew it would be your last conversation. The last time I talked to Jim was the day he died. He called me to say, ""Hi, Mom! I just called to say I love you. Got to go to work. Bye."" He gave me something to treasure forever. If there is any purpose at all to Jim's death, maybe it is to make others appreciate more of life and to have people, especially families, take the time to let each other know just how much we care. You may never have another chance. Do it today!"	['Do It Today']
Why did Tom go to the park? Because _ .	"The day was like any other day in his life. Tom walked past the shop on the street corner. He stopped to look at the front row of shoes, and he felt happy to see that the pair of shoes he wanted very much was still there. Looking down at his old shoes, he felt sorry for himself.

Tom looked at him and was surprised to see that the boy had no feet. He looked at his own feet. ""It's much better to be without shoes than without feet. ""he thought.

Which of the following sentences about the web in north Texas is TRUE according to the passage?	"People who have a fear of ugly insects will want to stay far away from Lake Tawakoni State Park in north Texas, US. A giant spider web was recently found there. The thick web is swarming with millions of little spiders. Stretching across several acres it blankets a number of trees, bushes and even the ground. While the web may make some people nervous, it has become a big attraction for others-especially for unlucky insects. ""At first, it was so white that it looked like fairyland,"" said Donna Garde, the park's manager. ""Now it's filled with so many mosquitoes that it's turned a little brown."" Most spiders work alone, which is why the discovery of the huge web has caused such a stir. Scientists across the country have been debating its origin. Some spider experts' say the monstrous web may have been weaved by social spiders. Social spiders work together to build larger webs to catch small insects. However, those webs take years to build. Park officials say this web was formed in just a few months. Others say it could be the work of millions of tiny ballooning spiders. These types of spiders 'fly' by throwing out thin threads of silk, which they use to ride air currents . In 2002, a similar giant web made by ballooning spiders was discovered in a field in Canada. Texas entomologist Herbert Pase says the giant web is very unusual. ""From what I'm hearing, it could be a once-in-a-life-time event,"" he said. But John Jackman, an entomologist and professor at Texas A&M University, disagrees. Jackman says he hears reports of similar webs, like the one in Canada, every few years. ""There are a lot of folks that don't realize spiders do that,"" he said. ""Until we get some samples sent to us, we won't know what species of spider we're talking about."" Park officials expect the web to last until fall when the weather gets cooler. That's when the spiders begin dying off in the park."	['It is not certain yet what spiders made the web.']
From the passage we can learn that_.	"Last week, we explained that the planet Mars has passed ""opposition. ""It passed a point opposite the Sun. This week, we tell about the planet's surprising motion among the stars. For thousands of years, people have recognized that planets travel among the stars. The planets generally follow the path taken by the Sun through the sky. The Sun's path is called the ecliptic. The groups of stars along the ecliptic are called the Zodiac. The motion of the planets can be confusing at times. Everyone knows the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But this is caused by the turning motion of the Earth. Planets generally move from west to east. However, Mars will appear to move backward for about two months this year. This happens because the Earth is overtaking Mars on its way around the Sun. Mars began its backward, or westward, motion on May 11th, It will start moving eastward again on July 19th. Mars' apparent motion has been a mystery to astronomers for hundreds of years. Most early theories of the solar system argued that the Sun and planets turned around the Earth. But the sudden westward motion of Mars presented a problem. Why would Mars move west for two months when it nears ""opposition""? In 1543, a Polish church worker named Nicolas Copernicus published a different theory. His theory said the Earth and planets moved around the Sun in perfectly circular orbits. Copernicus' theory was simpler. But his Sun - centered system still did not explain the observed motion of Mars very well. Finally, a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler published a complete theory of the motion of the planets in 1619. He had carefully studied the motion of Mars for many years. Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets do not move in circular orbits around the sun. Instead, they travel in flattened orbits called ellipses. Mars' elliptical orbit is the cause of its unusual brightening this year and its apparent large size.

They may want to move out of the family or home for a while. Many parents will say no to this demand. But experts say it might be a good idea to let your teens live with a friend or a relative. ""It was the break I needed at the time,"" said Richard Lerne. He is talking about the time he spent living with his grandmother when he was 15. ""It allowed me to be a more different person than I was with my parents."" Lerne said. He now heads the Institute for Children, Youth and Families at Michigan State University. Experts say teens living away from their families can test new ways of thinking and getting along with people. They may see new ways to problems. Some teens who want some time away from family attend a structured summer program. Others live for a while with a relative or with the family of a friend. If there is conflict at home, having a teen live elsewhere can benefit other family members. It gives everyone space to develop better relationships. Joseph Kett teaches history at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He says living at home until the late ten years has become the norm only in recent times. ""In the 17th century, children were often sent to live in other people's home when they were about 10 or 11"", he said. Peter Sheras teaches education at the University of Virginia. He says parents should listen when a child wants to move out. They should try to find out why the child wants some time away."	['let them live away from their family']
What do we know about the Imagination Stage?	"As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder. Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage. Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X. Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme. ""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities. One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti. Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."""	"[""It's a cooperative partner of White Oak'S African Club.""]"
Which of the following is true about the author?	"For a while, I wrote a ""Tuesday tip"" on my blog Lyonsdenmom.com. It was about easy week-night dinners, organizing parties or perhaps finding time out for friends. About a year ago, I ran out of tips. The truth? As a busy working mom with five busy kids, I probably do have a few tips to share. But honestly, the bar is set pretty low---on a recent day when I was walking our dog, a stranger who knew I had five kids said, ""Wow! You have a dog, too?! And it even looks like you showered today!"" Yes, it's true, I shower. Not every day, but most days. See, I'm telling the truth. Honestly, in this cold winter, I'm probably taking a shower more to warm up than to clean up. Other funny truths? I'm tired. In fact, for the past year, I've been too tired to type up any update on our life here in Lyons Den. It's hard to arrange a career with all these kids. Although folks just believe that it must be so much easier now since all the kids are in school, I'm here to tell you, it's not. It's really not. When I get home from work, I'm often tearfully greeted by five kids and five homework folders filled with math facts, invitations, notices and artwork. All those happy smiling faces I share on Facebook are real. We are a happy family---thank God for that! But we're not always smiling, and even in those rare best times when I can get all five kids looking at the camera, the odds would be that one of them isn't wearing underwear, one is pinching someone behind the scenes and one is just perfectly pronouncing ""Damn!"" So, less perfectly-posed pictures, but more telling the truth. Even if only on Tuesday."	"[""She's living a happy life with her family""]"
Which of the following is not talked about in the passage?	"Can feeling of nostalgia be good for you? or is it unhealthy to have a strong love for the past? For years, medical experts have studied nostalgia and the reasons for it. Many experts warn that too much nostalgia is harmful. They say linger in the past shows that a person is unhappy with his present life. These feelings keep the person from living his life to its fullest. Dr. Louise Kaplan has written several books about nostalgia. She says these feelings often begin when a young person is between 13 and 19 years old. ""This is the time when you must face the loss of your childhood, "" Kaplan says. ""You see your new life is easily destroyed. But you think romantically about a golden past. You remember your childhood as a time when life was perfect."" These feelings continue as a person gets older, Kaplan adds. She says many grown persons have a hard time keeping up with changes in the modem world, so they think back to their younger years. At that time the world seemed simple and more harmless. Kaplan says these feelings are not always actually existing. The good old days weren't always good. However, she says nostalgia can be helpful, if used properly. ""Feelings of nostalgia can cause you to remember a time when you had high hopes and dreams, "" Kaplan says. ""It might give you the strong wish to catch those dreams today, in your present life."" She adds that nostalgia can prevent you from ""cutting yourself off from your aim."" ""At its best, "" Kaplan says, ""nostalgia has the ideas for the future."""

The tiger didn't eat the fox at last, did he ?	"One day a tiger caught a fox in the forest . Before the tiger eat him , the fox said, ""You can't eat me, I'm king of the forest. If you eat me , all the other animals in the forest will be angry with you."" The tiger didn't believe him. The fox said, ""If you don't believe me, then take a walk with me in the forest. You can see whether they are afraid of me."" The tiger thought it was a good idea, so they started together. The fox walked in front and the tiger went behind. When the other animals saw the tiger coming, they ran away as fast as they could. The fox called out, "" Mr Tiger, you see, all the animals are afraid of me."" The tiger said, ""Yes, you are quite right."" He let the fox go ."	"[""No, he didn't""]"
If a person plays safe to get a bonus, he is probably being _ .	"Bonus culture has become the subject of many studies nowadays. Many people have been angered by the way some bankers and high officials seem to have been rewarded for failure. Others find the idea of offering many-million-dollar bonuses morally disgusting. But few have asked whether performance-related bonuses really do improve performance. The answer seems so obvious that even to ask the question can appear ridiculous. Indeed, in spite of all the complaints about them, financial encouragements continue to be introduced in more and more areas, from healthcare and public services to teaching and universities. So it may come as a shock to many to learn that paying for results can actually make people perform badly in many circumstances, and that the more you pay, the worse they perform. No one is arguing that bonuses can help companies and institutions attract and keep the best staff. Nor does anyone argue against the idea that you can encourage people to do specific tasks by linking payments to those tasks. Rather, the point is about how to get the best out of people. Do employees really perform better if you promise to pay them more for getting results? There are some obvious reasons why such payments can fail. It has been argued, for instance, that cash bonuses contributed to the financial crash, because traders had little enthusiasm to make sure that their companies enjoyed long-term survival. Most bonus projects are poorly designed, says Professor Malcolm Higgs. He thinks the reason is that organizations try to keep bonus arrangements simple. Nevertheless, he thinks bonus projects can work as long as they link the interests of individual employees with the long-term goals of a business. Bonuses can also encourage cheating. ""Once you start making people's rewards dependent on outcomes rather than behaviors, the evidence is people will do whatever they can to get those outcomes,"" says Professor Edward Deci. ""In many cases the high officials simply lied and cheated to make the stock price go up so they got huge bonuses."" But the work of Deci and others suggests the problem with bonuses runs far deeper than poor design or cheating. In 1971, he asked students to solve puzzles, with some receiving cash prizes for doing well and others getting nothing. Deci found those offered cash were less likely to keep working on puzzles after they had done enough to get paid. These studies suggest that offering rewards can stop people doing things for the pure joy of it. This was the basis for a series of books by Kohn in which he argues that rewarding children, students and workers with grades, scholarships and other ""bribes"" leads to low-quality work in the long run. Those who believe in the power of bonuses fail to distinguish between inner drive and outside pressure -- wanting to do something because you like it for itself in contrast to doing something because you want the reward, Kohn says. ""It's not just that these two are different, it's often that the more you reward people for doing something, the more their inner drive tends to decline."" A ""do this and get that"" approach might improve performance in the short term, but over longer periods it will always fail, Kohn says. People who receive bonus will naturally play safe, become less creative, cooperate less and feel less valued, he adds. What's more, the studies also suggest that offering rewards can also stop people taking responsibility."	['less daring']
According to the passage, the following statements are true EXCEPT that_.	"According to a joint survey by the Social Investigation Center of China Youth Daily and the news center of Tencent.com,76.9% of the 5,21l respondents ,all being youths in their 20s, believe the society needs chutouniao(""leading birds"")who dare to take risks to show their worth,although,as the Chinese, saying goes, ""The leading bird gets shot first.""or ""One who takes the lead usually bears the brunt of an attack."" About 58.2%of the respondents think that one has to work hard at all times, and one must know how to show off when the chance comes.53%of them also believe that it is necessary to be aggressive ,sometimes. ""I wish my employees will let me know when they have achieved something.""said LiuXueyuan,the president of a media company,as it is impossible for him to know all his employees well.However, showing off too much is of course no good, either.""One who likes to show off one's achievement will also be the first to be noticed when one makes a mistake.""said Liu.He suggested that the employees should do their jobs steadily and surely. Although most respondents think chutouniao are necessary,not many of them like to hobnob with such persons.In fact, 65.9% of the respondents simply don't like them,while 7.1% of the respondents expressed their hatred of them. Faced with the conflict between ""needed by the society"" and ""disliked by fellow beings,"" quite a large number of people have let slip chances.59.6% of the respondents regret it."

The Winter Olympics is held once _ .	People call the Winter Olympics the White Olympics. At this time, they publish many stamps to mark the great games. The first stamps came out on January 25th, 1932 in the United States for the 3rd White Olympics. From then on , publishing stamps during the White Olympics became a rule. During the 4th Winter Olympics, people published a group of stamps in November 1936. They drew five rings of Olympics. It was the first time that the rings appeared on the stamps of the White Olympics. In the 1950s,the stamps of this kind became more colorful. When the White Olympics came, the host countries as well as non-host countries published stamps to mark those games. China also published four stamps in February 1980 when the Chinese sportsmen began to take part in the White Olympics. In Asia, Japan was the only country to hold the White Olympics. They sold 14,500 million stamps during the Olympics. People drew different kinds of sports on these small stamps, and they enjoyed the wonderful sports and some excellent players.

Where is the source of the Mississippi?	The Mississippi is the major river system in the United States. The Yangtze is China's longest river. Although a world apart, the two waterways share conservation concerns that provide a cultural bridge between students in the United States and China, as well as from around the world. The Mississippi flows almost 3,800 kilometers from a small lake in Minnesota, gathering the waters of 250 other rivers and streams before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. In mid-May, as spring flowers began to open, about 41 students from a dozen colleges, mostly in the Midwest, explored a section of the river in Wisconsin and Iowa, to learn about the environment, and each other. The students, from the U.S., China and around the world, came to join the River Spirit Exchange program. The cross-cultural educational experience - set up by the University of Wisconsin, Madison-based Environment and Public Health Network for Chinese Students - focuses on the Mississippi and China's longest river, the Yangtze. This three day get-together featured story-telling, hiking, camping and canoeing, all part of a larger lesson about conservation projects that can be used on both the Yangtze and Mississippi. While the students learned about the problems challenging the Mississippi and Yangtze, Jeb Barzen, a wildlife biologist, explained they should also learn about the importance of bridging each other's culture. The president of the Environment and Public Health Network for Chinese Students, Xiaojun Lu, said the Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers are uniting these students from opposite ends of the earth. Organizers say the success and spirit of this first gathering of students will lead to other trips, including one down the Yangtze.	['Minnesota']

The passage is mainly about _ .	Have you ever noticed how busy our roads are becoming? Every year more and more cars are using them. Already in such countries as America, almost every family has a car. Many accidents happen because cars are now made to travel very fast. Also, people waste time and money every day as long lines of cars move slowly into towns and cities. In most big towns it is very hard to find parking spaces. Wide, smooth , straight roads must be built now in place of the old and narrow roads. These roads must not pass through towns and cities. They must not be crossed by other roads. Today such roads are being built in many countries in the world. These roads have at least two lanes , one for slow-moving traffic and the other for fast-moving traffic. These roads do not pass through town and cities; horses and bikes are not allowed on them. Accidents do not usually happen. Cars can travel hundreds of miles without having to stop. But these modem roads often cannot be built in towns and cities. Before a road in a town can be made wider, many buildings have to be pulled down. Some people feel that more car-parks should be built outside a city, then the drivers should leave their cars and catch a bus or take a taxi to their offices.	['roads of the future']

From Billy's story, we can see that _ .	Today, traditional opinions about men still exist. A man has to be strong, brave, sports loving and manly. Anything less would not be considered manly. Sports such as football, basketball and boxing all tend to be men's sports. However, the dance of ballet is considered _ because it requires nice movements. This tradition is shown in the movie, Billy Elliot. Billy Elliot is a movie that protests against this traditional view of men. Billy Elliot is an eleven-year-old boy that has a natural talent for ballet dancing, but his father will not allow it. Billy's father wants him to take up boxing and become stronger, but Billy goes against his father's wishes and takes up ballet dancing. This difference of opinion makes Billy sad. What's more, his friends also laugh at him. After saving enough money, his father sends Billy to a weekly boxing course; however, Billy doesn't enjoy boxing because he always loses in matches and is often hurt. His ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson thinks that men or women should not be judged by the activities they like to do, so she tells Billy's father that although he wants his son to make a good living, he should let his son do what he loves to do because he has a talent for it. When his father finally realizes the truth, Billy is surprised. In the end, with the help of his father, brother and all the people around him, Billy goes to the Royal Ballet Academy in London and becomes a very successful ballet dancer.

When your children do something right, let them know. When your children do something wrong, tell them how they should do it and why. Here are some basic manners for children: 1. Wait for their turn and don't _ other people when they are speaking. Tell them to wait until someone finishes speaking, and then ask questions. 2. Always greet the people who come over to your house. You can teach your children to shake hands with grown-ups who come over, but it's not necessary to shake hands with other children. Your children should always say ""hello"" or ""hi"" when someone comes to your home so that the guest feels welcome. 3. Say ""please"" and ""Thank you"" often. And say ""You're welcome"" to answer others' ""Thank you"". 4. After playing a game, no matter what the result is, be pleased. If your children win, tell them not to show off , but to be kind. If they lose, tell them not to get mad and tell the other children that they did a good job or speak well of them. Yours Dr. Dave"	['can understand what she is saying']

The main idea of this passage is that _ .	It doesn't matter when or how much a person sleeps, but everyone needs some rest to stay alive. That's what all doctors thought, until they heard about Al Herpin. Al Herpin, it was said, never slept. Could this be true? The doctors decided to see this strange man themselves. Al Herpin was 90 years old when the doctors came to his home in New Jersey. They thought for sure that he got some sleep of some kind. So they stayed with him and watched every movement he made. But they were surprised. Though they watched him hour after hour and day after day, they never saw Herpin sleeping. In fact, he did not even own a bed. He never needed one. The only rest that Herpin sometimes got was sitting in a comfortable chair and reading newspapers. The doctors were _ by this strange continuous sleeplessness. They asked him many questions, hoping to find an answer. They found only one answer that might explain his condition. Herpin remembered some talk about his mother having been injured several days before he was born. But that was all. Was this the real reason? No one could be sure. Herpin died at the age of 94.

Which of the following is the result of the volcanic eruption?	A volcanic eruption in Iceland has sent ash across northern Europe Airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the Atlantic Ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports. Grimsvom is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in Europe. What makes Grimsvom different is that it lies under a huge glacier of ice up to 12 maters thick. The hot volcano heats up the ice above it, which then forms a layer of water between the glacier and the volcano This layer of water puts pressure on the volcano, keeping it stable, As the water flows out from under the glacier, the pressure lifts. The lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface. This is exactly what happened today. Now, airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash. according to KLM, one of Europe's biggest airlines, airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it. Going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane's engines, causing damage to the plane. The eruption has also caused problems for animals in Iceland. The volcano left ash and sharp. Glass-like rocks all over the countryside. Farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them from eating ash--covered grass to the sharp object.

The experiment Bellis turned out to be _ .	"Leave a camera on a mountaintop, and chances are, you'll never see it again.

Which of the following can be the best title of this passage?	"Nowadays, there is a heated debate on whether pollutants should be cleaned in the air. Cleaning up the air, while good for our lungs, could make global warming worse. And the pollutants still go up around the air, along with carbon dioxide. These pollutants are called aerosols and they include soot as well as mixtures of nitrogen and sulfur and other stuff into the air. Natalie Mahowald, a climate researcher at Cornell University, says so far, scientists have mostly tried to understand what those aerosols do while they're actually in the air. ""There are so many different kinds of aerosols,"" she says. ""Some warm and some cool. But in fact, humans are giving out a lot of extra aerosols, and they tend to cool for the most part."" The aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, or keep us cool. But it turns out that's not all they do. These aerosols also influence how much carbon dioxide gets drawn out of the air by plants on land and in the sea. ""They can add nutrients, for example, to the oceans or to the land,"" Mahowald says. ""But also while they're in the atmosphere they can change the climate, and thus that also can influence the amount of carbon, the land or the ocean can take up. So there are quite a few different ways that aerosols can act on each other."" Mahowald's results suggest that reducing those pollutants could be an even bigger problem than realized, when you consider that aerosols help remove carbon dioxide from the air by encouraging plant growth. Hard numbers on this effect are highly uncertain at the moment, but this could turn out to be quite significant. And studying it is not easy because the effects aren't well understood. For example, nitrogen can be a fertilizer , but it can stop plant growing when nitrogen comes out of the air in acid form. Right now it seems like we're much more likely to clean up aerosol pollution, while increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the air.

"When American soldiers return home from war with disabilities, they often suffer twice -- first from their combat injuries, next from the humiliation of government dependency. Wounded veterans learn they have two basic choices: They can receive almost $3,000 a month in disability benefits along with medical care and access to other various welfare programs, or they can try to find a job. Especially in this economy, it's no wonder that many find that first option hard to turn down. Mark Duggan, an economics professor at Stanford University, reports that enrollment in U.S.veterans' disability programs rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2014. The percentage of veterans receiving benefits doubled, from 8.9% in 2001 to 18% in 2014. Disability services for veterans now consume $59 billion. In the 1980s and 1990s, male veterans were more likely to be in the labor force than nonveterans. But since 2000, that has changed dramatically. Now there is a 4% gap between veteran and nonveteran labor participation, with veteran participation lower. Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, founder of The Mission Continues, explains how soldiers who served their country are transformed into welfare receivers who live off their country. ""When veterans come home from war they are going through a tremendous change in identity,""he says.""Then the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and others, encourage them to view themselves as disabled.""By the time they come to Greitens' non-profit organization,""We meet a number of veterans who see themselves as charity cases and are not sure anymore what they have to contribute."" There are also more practical factors driving the disability boom. One is the expansion of qualification criteria. In 2000, for instance, type 2 diabetes was added as a disability because of evidence linking exposure to Agent Orange with the onset of the disease. Heart disease has also been added to the list. Another possible factor is that younger veterans seem less against welfare than their parents' generation. Veterans who have served since the 1990s are much more likely to sign up for disability than their older counterparts; 1 in 4 younger veterans is on disability versus just 1 in 7 of those over age 54. We shouldn't go back to the bad old days when veterans were afraid to admit weakness. But Lt.Col.Daniel Gade is one of many veterans who think our disability system is harmful, psychologically, to former soldiers. Gade lost his leg in combat in 2005 and now teaches at West Point. He recently gave a talk to disabled veterans at Ft. Carson, in which he urged them to rejoin the workforce. ""People who stay home because they are getting paid enough to get by on disability are worse off,""he warned.""They are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. They are more likely to live alone."" What a waste of human potential, especially since most veterans on disability still have their prime working years ahead of them when they're discharged . We could solve this problem by changing the way we view -- and label -- veterans with disabilities. As Gade noted in a recent article,""Veterans should be viewed as resources, not as damaged goods.""He recommended that""efforts to help veterans should begin by recognizing their abilities rather than focusing only on their disabilities, and should serve the ultimate aim of moving wounded soldiers to real self-sufficiency."" On a more practical note, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs could reallocate resources to spend more on job training and less on disability. Current placement programs are sadly inadequate. We are good at sending soldiers off to war. Yet when these young men and women return home, they are essentially told,""We'll give you enough for a reasonably comfortable life, but we won't help you find a job."" It is unreasonable that we are condemning thousands of young veterans who served their country to life on the dole rather than enabling them to reenter the workforce with the necessary accommodations."

What attitude do the British have towards Webster's dictionary?	In English the spelling of words does not always represent the sound. So people say /rait/ but spell it right or write, or even rite. Combinations of letters may be pronounced in many ways. And some words just seem to have too many letters. For Americans things are a little bit easier, thanks to the work of Noah Webster, a teacher who graduated from Yale University in 1778. As a young man, he had fought against the British in the American War of Independence, and he felt that written English in the newly independent United States should have a distinctive American look. So he began his work on American English. His first book, The Elementary Spelling Book, suggested simplifying the spelling of English words. The book was extremely popular. By the 1850s, it was selling one million copies a year, making it one of the most popular school books ever. Many of the suggestions were quickly adopted. Center instead of centre, program instead of programme, and flavor instead of flavour. Others, however, such as removing silent letters like s in island or the final e in examine, were not . Webster is best known for his American Dictionary of the English language, which first appeared in 1828. It introduced lots of new American words, with information about their pronunciation and use, and, of course, the new spelling. The British criticized the dictionary, but it quickly became a standard reference book in the States. Today, Webster's dictionary is still the number one dictionary for American students.

Why do young people like to have clothes and music in their own way ?	"It is natural that young people are often uncomfortable when they are with their parents . They say their parents don't understand them .They often think that their parents are out of touch with modern ways , that they are too serious -- too strict with their children and that they seldom give their children a free hand . It is true that parents often find it difficult to win their children's trust and they often forget how they themselves felt when they were young . For example , young people like to act _ without much thinking . It is one of their ways to show they have grown up and that they can face any difficult situation . However , older people worry more easily . Most of old people plan things ahead , at least in the back of their minds , and do not like their plans to be upset by something unexpected . When you want your parents to let you do something , you will have better success if you ask before you really start doing it . Young people often make their parents angry with their choices in clothes and in music . But they do not want to cause any trouble ; it is just that they feel cut off from the older people's world , into which they have not yet been accepted . That's why young people want to make a new culture of their own . And if their parents do not like their music or hairstyle or clothes or their ways of speech , this will make the young people very happy . Sometimes you are so proud of yourself that you do not want your parents to say ""yes"" to what you do . All you want is to be left alone and do what you like . It is natural enough , after being a child for so many years , when you were completely under your parents' control . If you plan to control your life , you'd better win your parents over and try to get them to understand you. If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility , they will certainly give you the right to do what you want to do ."

The author wrote the passage to _	"If there's one thing I' ve learned from my years of being a kid, it' s that you have ZERO control over your own life. Ever since school ended, I haven' t had anything I' ve needed to do or anywhere I' ve needed to be. As long as the air-conditioning was working and the TV remote had batteries in it, I was ready for a relaxing summer holiday. But then, out of the blue, this happened - "" Pack your bags. We' re going on a road trip ! "" Mom said excitedly. This isn't the first time Mom has sprung a trip on us without any warming. Last year on the first day of summer, she said we were going .to visit Aunt Loretta at the nursing home. It wasn't exactly my idea of a fun way to kick off the summer. One time when we visited Aunt Loretta, her roommate grasped me and wouldn't let me go until someone gave her a chocolate cookie ! Mom kept talking about going to the nursing home for a whole day, which made me worry a lot. But at breakfast the next morning, she told us where we were really going - Disney World. I was very happy, because I was really worried about spending the whole week at the nursing home. So was Dad. But when my little brother, Danny, heard about the change he became very angry. Mom had talked up the Aunt Loretta trip so much that Danny was actually excited about going there. We ended up putting off our trip to Disney so we could visit Aunt Loretta. I tried to talk Mom into letting us do something normal, like going to a water park for the day, but she didn't want to hear it. She said that spending a lot of time together in the car would be a "" bonding"" experience for the whole family."	['share with readers his childhood experiences']

How long did it take the boy to finish the work?	"There was a man who had a little son. He loved him very much. Every day after work the man would come home and play with the little boy. When the man came home from work one night, he found that he had some extra work to do. And he wasn't able to play with his little son. He wanted to give the boy something to keep him busy. So, looking around his study, he saw a magazine with a large map of the world on the cover. He got an idea. He patiently tore the map up into pieces. Then he led his son into the dining room and spread the pieces on the table. He explained to the boy that it was a map of the world. He told the boy to put it back together and they could play together when he finished. Surely this could keep the child busy for hours, he thought. After about thirty minutes, the boy came to the man and said, ""Okay, it's finished, Dad. Can we play now?"" The man was surprised, saying, ""That's amazing! How did you do that?"" The boy said, ""It was easy. On the back of the page was a picture of a man. When I put the man together, the whole world appeared completely."""	['About half an hour.']
What we should do to have friends according to the author?	"Having friends may well keep you healthier and help you deal with stress better. Some studies show that people with close friends have a greater ability to fight disease than people who are alone. Place friendship in the first place.

Open up to close friends. Keeping a deep friendship requires a level of ""heartfelt"" intimacy .Don't be afraid to express your inner fears and disappointments. Listen to your friends when they have problems,but offer advice only when it's wanted. Help raise friends' selfesteem when they are sad about a job loss, or other such events.
