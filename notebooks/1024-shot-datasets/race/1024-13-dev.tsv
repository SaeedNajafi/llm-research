What is the writer's attitude towards the things that changed in the nation's capital?	I WAS BORN and raised in the shadow of the Capitol, in prefix = st1 /Washington,D.C., as were my parents and my mother's parents. Our row house was on a tree-lined street just blocks from the building that was the heart of the federal legislative branch. When I was a child, in the 1940s, friends and I would pack a lunch or ride a streetcar to the Capitol. If we roller-skated, we hid the skates in the bushes in the park across the street before entering the building. I knew every corner of the Capitol. We'd play hide-and-seek and pretend we saw ghosts in the halls and stairways. I don't know how we got away with it.I remember the beautiful ladies' rooms, with their marble floors and sinks. I pretended that I was a fine lady in them. In those days, you could walk around the Capitol dome , which was a little scary for me. I loved the wonderful paintings and statues and the subway rides to the SenateOfficeBuilding. It was like an amusement ride. I even used to sit in the gallery of the U.S. House of Representatives--until I became bored with all the talk and went on another adventure. Whenever I ran up the steps to the huge bronze doors of the Rotunda, I would look back to the world below like a hero. As soon as the doors were opened, the sense of history surrounded me, and I knew it was someplace special. Those were lucky days, when an American citizen could wander in the Capitol and be a part of history. Once war was declared, some things changed in the nation's capital. Because of concerns that Washington might be attacked, as Londonhad been, everyone prepared. Kids at my elementary school wore dog tags, and each of us was fingerprinted. My father, a pipe worker, became a civil defense warden . During an air raid, his job was to turn off any leaking gas. Since he always had a cigarette in his mouth, maybe that was not a good choice, but he had a gas mask and flashlight hanging in the rafters of our basement...the mask looked like a monster in the ceiling. My 15-year-old brother was a junior civil defense warden. During air- raid drills, he knocked on doors and asked people to put out their lights. I remember huge searchlights that crisscrossed the skies during the drills, looking for enemy planes.	['negative']
Darwin died at the age of _ .	"Charles Darwin (1809 - 1882) was a great naturalist, famous for his theory of evolution . One day two boys decided to play a trick on the great man. They took the body of a centipede , the head of a beetle , the leg of a grasshopper , and the wings of a butterfly, and glued them together. Putting the strange creature into a box carefully, they took it to Darwin. ""Please, sir,"" said one of the two boys, ""can you tell us what sort of a bug this is?"" The naturalist looked at the bug and then at the boys. ""Did it hum ?"" he asked. ""Oh, yes. It did!"" ""In that case,"" declared Darwin, ""I would say it's a humbug !"""	['73']
Why does the author think well of the conventions he attended?	"There are many people who could be Olympic Champions. I'd estimate five million people could have beaten me in the pole-vault on the years when I won it, at least five million. Men were stronger, bigger, and faster than I could have done it, but they never picked up a pole, never made the efforts to vault their legs off the ground to try to get over the bar. Greatness is all around us. It's easy to be great because great people will help you. What was fantastic about all the conventions I went to was that the greatest in the business would come and share their ideas, their methods and their techniques with everyone else. I have seen the greatest salesmen showing young salesmen exactly how they did it. They didn't hold back. I have also found it true in the world of sports. I'll never forget the time I was trying to break Dutch Warmer Dam's record. I was about a foot below his record, so I called him on the phone. I said, ""Dutch, can you help me? I seem to have _ . I can't get any higher."" He said, ""Sure, Bob, come on up to visit me and I'll give you all I got."" I spent three days with the master, the greatest pole-vaulter in the world. For three days, Dutch gave me everything he'd seen. There were things that I was doing wrong and he corrected them. To make a long story short, I went up eight inches. That great guy gave me the best that he had. Great people will share. Great people will tell you their secrets. Look for them, call them on the phone or buy their books. Go where they are, get around them and talk to them. It is easy to be great when you get around great people."	['Because great people were willing to share.']
Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	People turn to magic chiefly as a form of insurance--that is, they use it along with actions that actually bring results. For example, hunters may use a hunting charm . But they also use their hunting skills and knowledge of animals. The charm may give hunters the extra confidence they need to hunt even more successfully than they would without it. If they shoot a lot of game , they credit the charm for their success. Many events happen naturally without magic. Crops grow without it, and sick people get well without it.But if people use magic to bring a good harvest or to cure a patient, they may believe the magic was responsible. People also tend to forget magic's failures and to be impressed by its surface successes. They may consider magic successful if it appears to work only 10 percent of the time. Even when magic fails, people often explain the failure without doubting the power of the magic. They may say that the magician made a mistake in reciting the spell or that another magician cast a more powerful spell against the magician. Many anthropologists believe that people have faith in magic because they feel a need to believe in it. People may turn to magic to reduce their fear and uncertainty if they feel they have no control over the outcome of a situation. For example, farmers use knowledge and skill when they plant their fields. But they know that weather, insects, or diseases might ruin the crops. So farmers in some societies may also plant a charm or perform a magic rite to ensure a good harvest.	"[""Magic can solve problems people can't deal with in a natural way.""]"
The text mainly tells us _ .	In my thirty years as a time management speaker, I have observed a lot of what we can not and should not do to increase our daily results. Time management is not necessarily working harder, but rather smarter. A lot of our time management has to do more with what we are not doing rather than what we are doing. Sometimes our mistakes will keep us from running at a full pace. Here are some time management mistakes we should all avoid to help us increase our daily efficiency: Start your day without a plan of action. Without a plan, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough right things. Time management is not doing the wrong things more rapidly. That just gets us nowhere faster. Time management is doing the right things. Work with a messy desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends, on average, one and a half hours per day in looking for things. That's seven and a half hours per week. If you have ever visited the office of a top manager, you can easily find that he or she is working with a clean desk environment. Don't take a lunch break. Many people do not take a lunch break. They work through that time period in the hope that it will give them more time to finish the task. Studies have shown that it may work just the opposite. After doing what we do for several hours, our mind will become boring. A lunch break, even a fifteen-minute break, gives us a chance to get our batteries all charged up again.

When the head waiter asked the man not to take off his jacket, the man _ .	"A man in a very splendid restaurant started to take off his jacket. Seeing this, the head waiter dashed to his table and said, "" I'm afraid I must ask you to keep your jacket on, sir, for it is not good manners to do it in such a smart restaurant."" ""Now listen,"" said the man, ""I'll let you know that the Queen of England gave me permission to remove my jacket here."" ""The Queen of England?"" said the waiter in great surprise. ""Sure,"" replied the man, "" When I was in England last month, a friend of mine who had a very important position in high society took me to see the Queen. It was rather hot, so I started taking my coat off. The Queen looked over and said, ""You may do that in the United States, but you may not do it here. "" So I got the Queen's permission, right?"

"Who needs the ""smart clothes"" most?"	"It's 8:00 a.m. and you are running out of the door. You walk outside and your handbag suddenly says, ""Wait! You forgot your keys!"" A talking handbag? Yes, it's true. This ""smart bag"" can ""talk"" to the things you often bring with. If you forget your keys or drop your purse, for example, the bag will tell you. How does it work? There is a ""smart chip"" in the bag. You put other chips on your phone, purse or keys. Then the bag and the others can ""talk"" to each other--and you! SMART CLOTHES These clothes change colors--while you are wearing them! Is it hot outside? Watch your jacket change from dark blue to a lighter color to protect you from the sun. Did you spill coffee on your white trousers or shirt? No problem. These smart clothes never get dirty!"	['Someone working in a restaurant.']
In many readers' eyes, Rochester, _ .	The Bronte sisters were three sisters who became famous novelists. Their lives and works are connected with the lonely moors of Yorkshire, England, where they lived. Patrick Bronte, the sisters' father, was a poor Irishman who became the parish clergyman of the small, isolated town of Haworth, Yorkshire. Bronte was somewhat strange and tended to be strict. His wife died in 1821 and her sister brought up the family out of duty, but with little love or understanding. The sisters went to several boarding schools where they received a better education than usual for girls at that time, but in a bad atmosphere. Few jobs were available for women at that time, and the Bronte sisters, except for occasional jobs as governesses or schoolteachers, lived their entire lives at home. They were shy, poor, and lonely, and occupied themselves with music, drawing, reading and ---above all---writing. Their isolation led to the early development of their imaginations. In 1846, under the male pen names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, the sisters published a joint volume of poems.Although only two copies were sold, all three sisters soon had their first novels published. Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel Jane Eyre (1847) is largely _ . Through the heroine, Charlotte relived her hated boarding school life and her experiences as a governess in a large house. Rochester, the hero and master of the house, is fictional. Jane Eyre was enormously successful, but many readers were shocked that Rochester, who tried to make Jane his mistress, should be rewarded by marrying her. Some readers were also shocked because Jane wanted to be regarded as a thinking and independent person, rather than as a weak female. Charlotte Bronte wrote three other novels. The first one, The Professor, was not published until 1857, after her death. Shirley (1849) is set among the labour riots of the early 1800s. Villette (1853) the most popular of the three, is based on Charlotte's unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels.	"[""did not deserve to be Jane's husband""]"
What do most people think causes bad behavior?	"Why do people drink too much, eat too much, smoke cigarettes or take drugs? What's to blame for all the bad behavior? Most people would say that, while these self-destructive acts can have many root causes, they all have one obvious thing in common: they are all examples of failures of self-control, lacking the will power to resist them. According to a recent study, however, if you really think about it, something about that simple answer doesn't quite make sense. In fact, it turns out that sometimes it's having will power that really gets you into trouble. Think back to the time you took your very first sip of beer. Disgusting, wasn't it? When my father gave me my first taste of beer as a teenager, I wondered why anyone would voluntarily drink it. And smoking? No one enjoys their first cigarette -- it tastes awful. So even though smoking, and drinking alcohol or coffee, can become temptation you need will power to resist, they never, ever start out that way. Just getting past those first horrible experiences actually requires a lot of self-control. Ironically , only those who can control themselves well, rather than give in to them, can ever come to someday develop a ""taste"" for Budweiser beer, Marlboro cigarettes, or dark-roasted Starbucks coffee. We do it for social acceptance. We force ourselves to consume alcohol, cigarettes, coffee and even illegal drugs, in order to seem experienced, grown-up, and cool. These bad habits aren't self-control failures -- far from it. They are voluntary choices, and they are in fact self-control successes. Self-control is simply a tool to be put to some use, helpful or harmful. To live happy and productive lives, we need to develop not only our self-control, but also the wisdom to make good decisions about when and where to apply it."	['Not having enough will power.']
By saying that it's just a game,we can infer that the Reed family_.	"For most seventh graders,life doesn't get much harder than a history test.But for Grant Reed of Bellville,Ohio,it's his own current events that are so painful.""Honestly,I don't want to die,""Grant says.Last year,doctors at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus found a tumor in Grant's brain.They cut it out,but the surgery left him with stroke--like symptoms.Plus,he had to go through months of radiation and chemotherapy to try to stop the spread of the disease. Yet,through it all,Grant has shown remarkable determination,which he owes, partly,to Ohio State football.His parents,Troy and Denise,were both in the OSU marching band and fell in love during halftime of the Michigan game.His cat is named after the team Buckeye.His wardrobe is painted scarlet(the color1 of the team's sportswear).The point is,almost nothing mattered more to Grant than Ohio State football-until he got sick,of course. ''I didn't like the word cancer,""Grant says.So he decided not to use the word.Instead,the kid named his cancer Michigan and insisted everyone in his life refer to it as such,because Ohio State always beats Michigan.That was something he could understand and make it into a competition.He was going to beat this disease. It's now been more than a year since Grant issued that announcement.""And if you look at his scans,""Dr.Randal Olshefski at Nationwide Children's says,""There's nothing there.There's a big space,but there's no tumor.'' ""Grant is beating Michigan.And although much of it has to go to science,don't discount the semantics .You have to do something to make it a disease you can fight.And for Grant,that was naming it Michigan.""his parents say. This weekend,Ohio State and Michigan will be battling like their lives depend on it.But in this house,the Reed family will be watching with a calm insight:it's just a game."

Which of the following is NOT true?	"Mrs Smith's husband went off on a business trip to Australia. He wanted to catch the 3:30 plane to Darwin. She was very surprised when he telephoned her at 5 o'clock and said that he was still at the airport. ""What happened?"" asked Mrs Smith. ""Well,"" said Mr Smith, ""everything was going fine. I got my ticket, checked my luggage and waited in line at the gate. I walked across the runway to the airplane and I saw my friend Jack Scott. Jack was an airplane engineer. I shouted to him and a policeman caught me."" ""Why did he catch you?"" ""I don't know,"" said Mr Smith,"" All I said was 'Hi, Jack! '"" The word ""hijack"" means ""to take control of a plane by force""."	['Mr Smith knew why the policeman caught him.']
"Rose was considered a ""time machine"" because she _ ."	"The first day our professor challenged us to get to know someone we didn't know. I looked around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady smiling at me. She said, ""Hi, handsome. My name is Rose. I'm 87. Can I give you a hug?"" I laughed, ""Of course you may!"" and she gave me a giant squeeze. ""Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?"" I asked. She jokingly replied, ""I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, and have a couple of children."" ""No seriously,"" I said. ""I want to realize my dream!"" she told me. Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and everyone liked to listen to this ""time machine"". At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet and I'll never forget what she taught us. ""There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are 19 and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn 20. If I am 87 and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn 88. We have less time to live on. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in change. The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do."" At the year's end, Rose finished the college degree she had dreamed about all those years. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over 2,000 students attended her funeral honoring the wonderful woman who taught us such an important message."	['had lived a long and rich life']
What can we infer from the passage?	"Born as the only child in the family, I am the ""king"" of the family. My parents are both businessmen and they come home every two weeks. Because they don't spend much time with me, they always feel guilty* and will buy me many expensive things and let me do whatever I want. My grandparents never let me do any chores because they want me to do my schoolwork. I used to take everything for granted*. I never said ""thank you"" to people. As time went by, I found that my classmates didn't like me and my best friends left me. one day, I asked Leo, who used to be one of my best friends. He said that I was selfish, rude* and bad-tempered*. ""No one wants to make friends with a person who always receives but never gives anything!"" he said. I was shocked* at his words. ""Oh, no! Please don't leave me. I need friends! I will be lonely and unhappy without friends!"" I locked myself up in the room and cried. ""I want my friends back. But how?"" Then I noticed that all the popular kids in the class friendly to others. They always smile and say ""thank you"" to others. They do whatever they can to help when others are in trouble. Other kids like them and always play with them. ""I need to change! I will get my friends back,"" I said to myself. From then on, I started to change myself. I learned to say ""thank you"" to others. I smiled and volunteered to help other kids. I tried to be as nice as I could. , I found that other kids liked to talk with me and they would ask me to play with them and even told me their secrets. My friends came back to me again. Now I have more friends than I used to do and I am happier than I used to be."	['To be a nicer and better person, we need to make some changes.']
What did Cerling's team produce in their research?	"Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand of hair, a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims. The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people's hair. ""You're what you eat and drink, and that's recorded in your hair,"" said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah. While U.S diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as rain clouds move. Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable, but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes . The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah. Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. Cerling's team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a map of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops. They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems. ""It's not good for pinpointing ,"" Cerling said. ""It's good for eliminating many possibilities."" Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake. The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair. When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months. She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming. ""It's still a substantial area,"" Park said ""But it narrows it way down for me."""	['A map showing the regional differences of tap water.']

What is the writer's purpose in writing this text?	"When my father married my mother in 1943,he gave my mother a 1937 crown coin and told her to keep it in the back of her purse and not spend it.This would mean that she always felt that she was protected and would always have money if she really needed it. When I was married in 1970, my husband who had heard this story,obtained a 1937 crown for me and I have always kept it in my wallet,and I have always had enough for my needs. A friend recently fell on hard times,partly through external circumstances and partly through poor planning.Friends and I have loaned her money,paid her bills,even given her food.tried to teach her budget techniques,and none of them has been a solution.She has just slipped deeper and deeper into financial trouble and depression. Last week she looked pale and unwell,very depressed and hopeless.I then thought about how the crown, a reminder of another care and love,had protected me,so 1 went to the bank for a $100 dollar bill.I told my friend the story and asked her to keep the $100 in the back of her wallet.It turned out that she didn't have a wallet,so she put the money in a little pencil case where she kept her coins.She immediately felt better.""I feel rich,and thank you for being a good friend"",she said,and we were both a bit teary. The reason for passing this on is not to praise any generosity on my part,but to show the power of ""random acts of kindness"".I went home and remembered a little wallet I had that I'd never used,and thought,""I'II give that to my friend"".I opened it,and inside,found $100. The universe is very just and if your heart is open the reward always comes."	['To show the power of acts of kindness.']

Why do people in Turkana no longer sing or dance any more?	"Earlier this year I traveled to Turkana in Kenya. I was there to take pictures of the ""broken food system"". As a special visitor, I was greeted with songs and dances. The locals used to sing and dance all the time but now Turkana is silent and has been for some years. No one is singing or dancing any more because they have no food, nothing to celebrate. Many of them are surviving on a little corn a day and water, which they can get just every two days. I met Tede Lokapelo, a local farmer who described the experience of a six-year drought . Tede used to have 200 goats, but now he has only seven left. He told me that this drought has taught him a hard lesson: It is too difficult to keep animals. He lives on animals. His traditional way of life has been completely destroyed now. Without the food aid they got, Tede is certain that they would starve because there are no other ways to feed themselves left. Sadly, the same can be heard in almost any developing country around the world. Almost one billion people go to bed hungry each night. The food system is broken. In Turkana, not enough rain has fallen since 2005. They measure rainfall not in days or weeks but in minutes. More and more people are being forced to rely on food aid, but people like Tede don't want food aid. They want to work and develop their country. It's our responsibility to change the situation so that they can support themselves. Drought is impossible to avoid but famine is manmade, and unless enough money is provided to develop a basic infrastructure for people in the area, thousands more lives are sure to be lost."

Danny likes traveling by plane because _ .	Traveling is very interesting. Many people love traveling. There are many ways to travel: by plane, by train, by ship or by car. Everyone has their favorite way. Greg:My favorite way of traveling is by car. I can bring my pet dog along. I can travel three hundred miles or only fifty miles a day. I can stop at a good restaurant to enjoy a good meal or at a hotel to spend the night. Eliza:I love traveling by train best! It's very exciting. I traveled most of Europe in 5 months by train. It's the best way to talk with the local people and make new friends on the way. Trains make even the longest trip enjoyable. The train ride to me is just like a big moving party. I also like traveling by ship. It is a very great way to spend a vacation. I can go to parties and movies on the ship, and enjoy the blue sky and water. Danny:Planes are my favorite. It's the fastest way of traveling. I can quickly get to another country. Planes have very comfortable seats. I can have something to drink and to eat. I can also read some free magazines and newspapers. .	['he can quickly get to another country.']
How did publishers feel about the rising e-book sales inspired by the Kindle?	"Despite the anxiety that Jones'Host-said by some to be the first digital novel-caused in 1993,publishers weren't too concerned that e-books would one day replace printed books.However,that attitude was changed suddenly in 2007 when Amazon's Kindle came onto the market,which led to e-book sales jumping up to 1,260%.Since then,e-books'popularity has continued to steadily rise.The publishing industry seemed to have lost all possible ability to regain its position.Will printed books eventually become a thing of the past? According to Mike Shatzkin,founder and CEO of the Idea Logical Company,printed books just for plain old reading will,in 10years from now,be unusual.""Not so unusual that a kid will say,'Mommy,what's that?'but unusual enough that on the train you'll see one or two people reading something printed,while everyone else is reading off of a tablet.""And Shatzkin believes that the demise of print is sure to happen,though such a day won't arrive for perhaps 50to 100or more years. Robert Stein,founder of the Institute for the Future of the Book,however,believes that books won't disappear entirely,at least not anytime soon.""Print will exist,but it will be in a different field and will appeal to a very limited audience,as poetry does today.Like woodblock printing,hand-processed film and folk weaving ,printed pages may assume an artistic value,""he says.He imagines that future forms of books might be developed not by conventional publishers but by the gaming industry.He also predicts that the distinction between writer and reader will be made less obvious by a social reading experience in which authors and consumers can digitally interact with each other to discuss any passage,sentence or line. Is there anything we risk sacrificing,should print really disappear entirely?According to Maryanne Wolf,director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University,electronic reading can negatively affect the way the brain responds to text,including reading comprehension,focus and the ability to maintain attention to details like plot and order of events.""My worry is that we'll have a short-circuited reading brain,excellent for gathering information but not necessarily for forming critical,analytical deep reading skills,""Wolf says. The field,however,is in an early stage,and findings about the negative effects of e-reading are far from certain.In light of this,Wolf hopes that we continue to maintain a""bi-literate""society-one that values both the digital and printed word.""A full reading brain circuit is a huge contribution to the intellectual development of our species.Anything that threatens that deserves our attention."""

Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?	"I had once helped a friend of mine run a watermelon stall. I noticed something interesting. Almost every buyer would lift the melon up to their ear,smartly tap it, apparently trying to listen to something. I wondered what they expected to hear. Finally I could no longer hold back my curiosity and made bold to ask a customer--an elderly gentleman--about this. Hearing my question,he roared with laughter. Then he replied in a selfmocking tone.""Young lady,I have been doing this for more than fifty years. All I know is that everybody would stare at you as if you were a fool if you just pick up the melon and leave!"" Not long after that,my watermelon stall friend unexpectedly sent me an invitation for her wedding,which really surprised me. I asked her, ""How come you are seized by a sudden desire to get married? I don't remember ever hearing you mention that yon've got a boyfriend."" She answered while counting money,""Everyone has to get married anyway,so it is better to get married sooner than later."" I could think of no word to refute her. It seems that everybody is living for everybody else and has forgotten the need of their own heart. It may be safe and save a lot of worries by following others' suit in doing things. The use of We or Us will give one a steady and sure sense of pride. But using the pronoun ""I"" would often give one a guilty conscience. I find all these things somewhat funny. We have got used to taking cue from others and follow their suit. In turn,we also take it for granted that we should judge the right and wrong of others by our own standard. As a matter of fact,this massive practice is still wrong though we all follow others' suit like this, but we feel at ease and, _ simply because this is the way of us, and so we can have an easy conscience because this has been practiced by so many people."

The two new whale sharks _	"Two new whale sharks arrived at the world's largest aquarium on Friday. Both whale sharks, the world's largest fish, arrived at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta after 6 a.m. The pair had been flown 8,000 miles from Taipei, Taiwan. They will join the aquarium's three whale sharks--the only ones on display outside of Asia. "" We re the only people in the world that can claim three times, "" aquarium director Jeff Swanagan said, "" Each time we learn more and more."" The two young males were given Asian names. One is Taroko, named after Taroko Gorge, a national park in Taiwan. The other is Yushan, which means ""Jade Mountain"", and is named after a mountain in Taiwan. The sharks were flown from Taiwan on a plane in 20-foot-long tanks with oxygen machines and other equipment to keep the water suitable for them. They arrived at about 3:30 a.m. in Atlanta, where their tanks were moved to two trucks and driven to the aquarium surrounded by some of Atlanta police cars with their blue lights flashing. They were lowered into their new home--as Norton and two females, Alice and Trixie, circled nearby, seemingly curious about the new arrivals. It is difficult to tell the age of the whale sharks, but at least one of the new arrivals is believed to be the smallest the aquarium has got. They are believed to be the aquarium's youngest whale sharks yet."	['have Asian names']
For the students in the small village, it is _ to get to school.	"How do you go to school? Do you take a bus or ride a bike? For many students, it is easy to get to school.

Which of the following is true?	"Visitors to Britain are sometimes surprised to learn that newspapers there have such a large circulation . For example, national newspapers, the ""Daily Mirror "" and the ""Daily express"" both sell about four million copies everyday. Most of British families buy a newspaper every morning and two or three on Sundays. Besides the national papers, there is, however, another branch of the British newspapers, local newspapers. Local newspapers have a weekly circulation of 13 million. Almost every town and county area has one. Nearly all them hold their own and many of them are very profitable . These papers are written almost entirely for readers interested in local events-births, weddings, deaths, council meetings and sports. Editors prefer to believe people who know the district well. A great deal of local news is regularly supplied by clubs and churches in the neighborhood. The editors must never forget that the success of any newspaper depends on advertising. But if the newspaper is well written and the news items have been carefully chosen to draw local readers, the business men will thank for the chance to keep their products in the public eyes."

What is the message conveyed in the story?	"The first Ml choir rehearsal of the school year took place in the school hall. All the students joined together to sing. I watched as my elder sister and her grade came in and took their places next to us on the stage. Meanwhile, I could hear laughing. Some students were pointing at a girl standing next to my sister. I'd never seen this girl before. A girl whispered in my ear, "" Did you know she's wearing diapers ?"" After school that evening, I asked my sister about the girl I'd seen. She told me her name was Theresa and that she was a very nice girL ."" Why were those kids being mean to her? I asked, ""Because they're stupid,"" she said. One day, I was walking home from school when I heard voices behind me. ""There's the little idiot's sister. Does your sister wet her pants too?"" I walked a little faster and then I felt a atone hit me in the back. When I got home, I ran down to my sister's room. I pushed my way into her room, screaming at her. ""Why do you have to be that giri's friend? I don't see anyone else being nice to her, "" Janelle yelled back, Because she is a wonderful person and she is dying!"" I will remember those words as long as I live. Theresa wet her pants because she had an illness, which was killing her. My sister was the only one nice enough to be her friend and stick up for her. A few months later, Hieresa passed away. I felt proud that Janelle was my sister. Throughout the years I watched her, and she always made friends with everyone. It didn't matter if they ware fat, thin, brilliant or not. She never left anyone feeling isolated or alone. It was she who changed me and taught me to never look at anyone in the same way again."

Some Asian parents send their kids abroad because _ .	"In Canada and the United States, there is a new group of children called ""satellite kids"", who live in one place but whose parents live in another place. Asians are immigrating to Canada and the United States in larger numbers than ever believe that they can give their children a better education in the west. In Asia, especially in China, Japan, and Korea, it is difficult to go to university. Students must first pass the strict national examination. However, in Canada and the United States, it is easy to go to university, and anyone who wants to go can go. As a result, Asian parents decide to leave their countries so that their children can go to university. The problem is that when Asians arrive, they discover that finding a job and making money are more difficult in the West than in the East. Also, they find that they are very lonely, and that they miss their homes. Because of these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the West. Therefore, these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the west. Therefore, these children become satellite kids"", and most of their parents do not know how sad it is to be a ""satellite kid"". Only until now are Canadians and Americans discovering the ""satellite kids"" problem. Because these children do mot speak English and because their parents are not there to take care of them, they are often absent from school. To be a ""satellite kid"" means growing up in a country where you know you are different and where you cannot make friends because you do not speak English well. Also, it means growing up lonely, because your parents are elsewhere. What these ""satellite kids ""will probably say to their parents is that it's better to have parents around than to have a university education. ,."

In this passage, the author wants to tell _ .	I heard many parents complaining that their teenage children are rebelling. I wish it were so. At your age you ought to be growing away from your parents. You should be learning to stand on your own two feet. But take a good look at the present rebellion. It seems that teenagers are taking the same way of showing that they disagree with their parents. Instead of striking out boldly on their own, most of them are clutching at one another's hands for reassurance. They claim they want to dress as they please. But they all wear the same clothes. They set off in new directions in music. But somehow they all end up huddled round listening to the same record. Their reason for thinking or acting in thus-and-such a way is that the crowd is doing it. They have come out of their cocoon into a larger cocoon. It has become harder and harder for a teenager to stand up against the popularity wave and to go his or her own way. Industry has firmly carved out a teenage market. These days every teenager can learn from the advertisements what a teenager should have and be. And many of today's parents have come to award high marks for the popularity of their children. All this adds up to a great barrier for the teenager who wants to find his or her own path. But the barrier is worth climbing over. The path is worth following. You may want to listen to classical music instead of going to a party. You may want to collect rocks when everyone else is collecting records. You may have some thoughts that you don't care to share at once with your classmates. Well, go to it. Find yourself. Be yourself. Popularity will come -- with the people who respect you for who you are. That is the only kind of popularity that really counts.	['teenagers to try to pursue their real selves']

Millions of people are using cell phones today.In many places it is actually considered unusual not to use one.In many countries,cell phones are very popular with young people.They find that the phones are more than a means of communication--having a mobile phone shows that they are cool and connected. The explosions around the world in mobile phone use make some health professional worried.Some doctors are concerned that in the future many people may suffer health problems from the use of mobile phones.In England,there has been a serious debate about this issue.Mobile phone companies are worried about the negative publicity of such ideas.They say that there is no proof that mobile phones are bad for your health.

What is it that makes mobile phones potentially harmful?The answer is radiation.Hightech machines can detect very small amounts of radiation from mobile phones.Mobile phone companies agree that there is some radiation.But they say the amount is too small to worry about. As the discussion about their safety continues,it appears that it's best to use mobile phones less often.Use your regular phone if you want to talk for a long time.Use your mobile phone only when you really need it.Mobile phones can be very useful and convenient,especially in emergencies.In the future,mobile phones may have a warning label that says they are bad for your health.So for now,it's wise not to use your mobile phone too often.

AIDS children can benefit from food rations in that _ .	The creative projects of World Food Program (WFP) focused on preventing hunger from taking hold in the future and breaking the cycle of hunger. Here are some of the ways in which we work to prevent hunger in the future: School Meals As well as directly addressing hunger, School Meals projects encourage families to keep their children in school and help them build better futures. If children aren't hungry they will concentrate on their lessons. With a solid education growing children have a better chance of finding their own way out of hunger. These projects benefit girls especially. For more information: www.wfp.org/schools meals. Food for Assets WFP's Food for Assets projects provide the hungry with food to lay the foundation for a better tomorrow. When poor farmers no longer have to worry about the next meal, they have the time and energy to build irrigation systems that can increase production. Similarly, Food for Training projects allow the poor to devote time to learning skills that will sustain them economically in the future. For more information: www.wfp.org/food-assets. HIV/AIDS WFP uses its food rations to reduce the blow of HIV and AIDS. The agency distributes its rations to people living with HIV and AIDS, so they can keep providing for their families for longer and have time to transfer vital knowledge and skills to the growing number of AIDS children--the next generation of food providers in developing countries. For more information: www.wfp.org/hiv-aids. Purchase for Progress WFP buys large amounts of food in developing countries. It has this purchasing power and uses it to help poor farmers contact reliable markets where they can get competitive prices for their produce. With secure markets, farmers will be encouraged to produce more and innovate .The knock-on effect is producing more food for everyone. For more information: www.wfp.ofp/purchase-progress.

According to the passage, internet supporters believed that _ .	"In the early days of the Internet, the idea that it represented an entirely new and separate field distinct from the real world was seized upon by both supporters and critics of the new technology.Supporters liked the idea that the virtual world was a placeless datasphere, liberated from constraints and restrictions of the real world, and an opportunity for a fresh start.For instance, John Perry Barlow, an internet activist, issued the ""Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"" in February 1996.He thundered, ""Governments of the industrial world, I come from cyberspace, the new home of mind.Cyberspace does not lie within your borders.We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. Where Mr.Barlow found the separation between the real and virtual worlds exciting, however, critics regarded it as a cause for concern.They worried that people were spending too much time online, communicating with people they had never even met in person in chat rooms, virtual game worlds and, more recently, on social - networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook.A study carried out by the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in 2000, for example, found that heavy internet users spent less time talking to friends and family, and warned that the Internet could be ""the ultimate isolating( ) technology"". Both groups were wrong, of course.The Internet has not turned out to be a thing apart.Unpleasant aspects of the real world, such as taxes, crime and cheating are now characteristics of the virtual world, too.C'amers who make real money selling swords, gold and other things in virtual game worlds may now find that the tax man wants to know about it.Designers of virtual objects in Second Life, an online virtual world, are seeking to real -world lawsuits in order to protect their intellectual property. At the same time, however, some of the most exciting uses of the Internet rely on combining it with the real world.Social networking allows people to stay in touch with their friends online, and plan social activities in the real world.The distinction between online and offline chatters does not matter any more. All these approaches treat the Internet as an extension or an attachment to the physical world, not a separate space.Rather than seeing the real and virtual fields as distinct and conflicting, in short, it makes sense to see them as complementary and connected."

This news report is most likely to be selected from the _ newspaper.	"Six Chinese surveillance ships have entered waters near islands claimed by both China and Japan. China said the ships were carrying out ""law enforcement"" to demonstrate its jurisdiction over the islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. At least two of the vessels left after the Japanese coast guard issued a warning, Japanese officials say. The move came after Japan sealed a deal to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owner. Japan controls the uninhabited but resource-rich East China Sea islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan. The Japanese Coast Guard said the first two Chinese boats entered Japan's territorial waters at 06:18 local time (21:18 GMT Thursday), followed by another fleet of four other ships just after 07:00. The first two ships then left the area. A third ship left later on Friday morning, one report said. No force was used, Japanese officials added. ""Our patrol vessels are currently telling them to leave our country's territorial waters,"" the coastguard said in a statement. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that its ships were there. ""These law enforcement and patrol activities are aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,"" a statement said. The US has called for ''cooler heads to prevail'' as tension intensifies between China and Japan over the islands, which lie south of Okinawa and north of Taiwan. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is due to visit both Japan and China from this weekend as part of a tour of the region that also includes New Zealand. The dispute has seriously marred diplomatic relations between China and Japan and threatens to damage the strong trading relationship, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing. The row has also generated strong nationalist sentiment on both sides that observers say now makes it very difficult to be seen to be backing down, says our correspondent. The Japanese government says it is buying the islands to promote their stable and peaceful management. Its move followed a bid by right-wing Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara to buy the islands using public donations - an action that would likely have further provoked China. China, on the other hand, says the islands have historically been its territory and fishing grounds. Meanwhile Japan's newly-appointed ambassador to China, Shinichi Nishimiya, remains in hospital in Tokyo after he was found unconscious near his home in Tokyo on Thursday. No details have been given on his condition. He was appointed on Tuesday to replace Uichiro Niwa, who has been criticised for his handling of one of the worse diplomatic rows between Japan and China in recent years."	['British']
What does the research tell us about feeding a baby on demand?	I have been consistently opposed to feeding a baby regularly. As a doctor, mother and scientist in child development, I believe there is nothing to recommend it, from the baby's point of view. Mothers, doctors and nurse alike have no idea of where a baby's blood sugar level lies. All we know is that a low level is harmful to brain development and makes a baby easily annoyed. In this state, the baby is difficult to calm down and sleep is impossible. The baby asks for attention by crying and searching for food with its mouth. It is not just unkind but also dangerous to say a four-hourly feeding schedule will make a baby satisfied. The first of the experts to advocate a strict clock-watching schedule was Dr Frederic Truby King who was against feeding in the night. I've never heard anything so ridiculous. Baby feeding shouldn't follow a timetable set by the mum. What is important is feeding a baby in the best way, though it may cause some inconvenience in the first few weeks. Well, at last we have _ research that supports demand feeding and points out the weaknesses of strictly timed feeding. The research finds out that babies who are fed on demand do better at school at age 5, 7, 11 and 14, than babies fed according to the clock. By the age of 8, their IQ scores are four to five percent higher than babies fed by a rigid timetable. This research comes from Oxford and Essex University using a sample of 10,419 children born in the early 1990s, taking account of parental education, family income, a child's sex and age, the mother's health and feeding style. These results don't surprise me. Feeding according to schedule runs the risk of harming the rapidly growing brain by taking no account of sinking blood sugar levels. I hope this research will put an end to advocating strictly timed baby feeding practices.	['The baby will grow to be wiser by the age of 8.']
The purpose of George Spilich's experiments is _ .	"Psychologist George Spilich and colleagues at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, decided to find out whether, as many smokers say, smoking helps them to ""think and concentrate."" Spilich put young non-smokers, active smokers and smokers deprived of cigarettes through a series of tests. In the first test, each subject sat before a computer screen and pressed a key as soon as he or she recognized a target letter among a grouping of 96. In this simple test, smokers, deprived smokers and nonsmokers performed equally well. The next test was more complex, requiring all to scan sequences of 20 identical letters and respond the instant one of the letters transformed into a different one. Non-smokers were faster, but under the stimulation of nicotine , active smokers were faster than deprived smokers. In the third test of short-term memory, non-smokers made the fewest errors, but deprived smokers committed fewer errors than active smokers. The fourth test required people to read a passage, then answer questions about it. Non-smokers remembered 19 percent more of the most important information than active smokers, and deprived smokers bested those who had smoked a cigarette just before testing. Active smokers tended not only to have poorer memories but also had trouble separating important information from insignificant details. ""As our tests became more complex."" Sums up Spilich, ""non-smokers performed better than smokers by wider and wider margins"" He predicts, ""smokers might perform adequately at many jobs until they got complicated. A smoking airline pilot could fly adequately if no problems arose, but if something went wrong, smoking might damage his mental capacity."""

This passage tells us .	Earthquakes happen without warning .They can happen any time of a day,at any point during the year.But don't worry because most are so weak that they cannot be felt. Only a few big ones hurt people. However,it's important to know what to do when an earthquake is happening. Do NOT go outside.You could get injured from falling glass or parts of buildings.If you are outside,stay away from buildings and power lines . Stay under a desk,table,or other strong furniture .Hold on to it.Or stay in a corner of the building.Cover your face and head with your arms and cover your mouth with a towel or clothing.Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Keep away from windows,pictures or advertisements on the wall or the building,and anything else that could fall and hurt you.Most people get injured by falling things during an earthquake,not by the shaking itself. Also keep away from a fire.You could fall down and burn yourself on the fire. If you are driving when an earthquake happens,stop the car if it's safe.Stay inside your car until the earthquake stops,and don't drive near bridges.

The passage mainly tells us about _ .	The Taj Mahal is considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and the finest example of the late style of Indian architecture . It is at Agra in northern India. It lies beside the River Jumna in the middle of gardens with quiet pools. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mogul emperor Shah Jehan, who ruled India in the 17th century. It is used to honour his favorite wife, known as Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. The building, which was completed between 1632 and 1638, was designed by a local Muslim architect , Ustad Ahmad Lahori. The whole building, with gardens and gateway structures, was completed in 1643. The Taj Mahal stands at one end of the garden tomb with marble path. The room is softly lighted by the light that passes through double screens of carved marble set high in the walls. The building now is kept in good condition. The Taj Mahal took 22 years to build. Shah Jehan planned a similar building, but in black instead of white, to lie on the other side of the river. But before it could be built, Shah Jehan was imprisoned by his son and buried next to his wife in the Taj Mahal.	['the Taj Mahal']
What would be the result of playing violent video games?	"A study has found, spending hours playing violent video games prevents teenagers from their moral growth. It is thought that regular touch to violence and lack of contact with the outside world makes it harder for them to tell right from wrong.They also struggle to trust other people,and see the world from their viewpoints. Researchers from Brock University in Ontario found that those who spend more than three hours each day in front of the screen are particularly unlikely to have developed the ability to empathize . The Canadian researchers surveyed 109 boys and girls,aged 13 and 14,about whether they played video games,which games they liked,and how long they spent playing them.Their findings found that 88 percent of teens said they played games,and more than half admitted to playing games every day.Violent games were among the most popular. The teenagers also filled in a questionnaire designed to measure their moral development.For example,they were asked how important it is to save the life of a friend. Previous studies have suggested that a person's moral judgment goes through four phases as they grow from children and enter adulthood.By the age of 13 or 14,scientists claim young people should be entering the third stage,and be able to empathize with others and take their viewpoints into account.The research found that this stage appeared to be delayed in teenagers who regularly played violent video games. It is also thought that teenagers who play games regularly did not spend enough time in the real world to learn to take others' thoughts into consideration.Researcher Mirjana Bajovic said:""The present results indicate that some teenagers, who spent three or more hours a day playing violent video games,are deprived of such opportunities."" he added:""Touch to violence in video games may influence the development of moral reasoning because violence is not only presented as acceptable but is also justified and rewarded."" They concluded that rather than trying to enforce an 'unrealistic' ban on the games,parents and teachers should encourage teenagers to do charity work and take up after-school activities."

Later, to live a better life, I bought my own taxi car. Till now, I've been in the taxi car business for thirty-five years. I know there is a lot about taxi drivers that is not so good. Because of this, people get the wrong impression that they are bad. In fact, taxi drivers are just like other honest people. You can read in the papers almost every week where a taxi driver turns in money or jewels people leave in their cars. One time in Brooklyn, I found a ring in my car. I remembered helping a lady with a lot of bags that day, so I went back to the store where I had dropped her off. It took me almost two days to look for her in order to return the ring. I didn't get as much as ""Thank you."" Still, I felt good because I had done what was right. In all my years of driving a taxi car, I have never had any trouble with the public because I always try to be nice to everyone. I try to be honest toward others. I have been trying this for a long time, and the longer I try, the easier it gets. I believe honesty is one of the greatest gifts there is. It's something that makes a man a good guy. This is also my way to live by."	['a ring']

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"The latest Chinese ""god song""(an Internet term to describe pop songs that spread virally through the Internet is still making debates between those who view it as a milestone for Chinese pop music going global and those who regard it as a bad image of China. Last week,Little Apple, written and performed by the Chopsticks Brothers, won the AMA International Song Award and _ performed the song at the 2014 American Music Awards in Los Angeles. Another Chinese pop singer, Zhang Jie, won the International Artist Award. But while fans of these singers are thinking highly of the awards and the performance by the Chopsticks Brothers at the AMA celebration, there are others who are less excited. They have questioned the value of the awards and what effect it will have on Chinese culture's ""going abroad"", saying it may leave foreign audiences with a poor impression of Chinese pop music, and even Chinese culture. The Little Applephenomenon, both home and abroad, can be more easily understood and judged if we look at it from a business view rather than a cultural view. The professional promoters behind the duo have developed a clear strategy to promote the duo and their works, not just this particular song.Little Applewas originally released to promote the duo's filmOld Boys: The Way of the Dragon. From the very beginning a marketing strategy was used to promote the song, which immediately went viral on the Internet due to its repetitive rhythm ,easy-to-remember lyrics , simple and funny dance and, most importantly, grass roots nature. The video accumulated more than 1 billion bits on China's major video websites. Although the song was generally disliked by music professionals who criticized it as ""musical junk food"",Little Apple's popularity nationally paved the way(...) for promoting the duo internationally."

The writer usually shares a car with _ .	"Well, what a bonus! Lots of us are using technology to find rides, and not just to school. It's awkward to call a friend and ask for a ride, and half the time they'll say, ""Sorry,my car is full."" But with Twitter and Facebook, you just tweet Ashleys Pool Party and look for other people heading the same way. It may sound risky, but many teens stay within their own social circles to find rides, and don't branch out beyond friends of friends when asking on Twitter. For me, I only rideshare with people I know, but to some young people, especially those taking longer trips, stranger danger is less of a concern. The sharing economy got big during the recession . It allows people to access more goods and services using technology, while also allowing them to share cost. And that, technology, for me, is what the car was for my mom, a gateway to more freedom. According to the researchers at the University of Michigan,30 years ago, eight in ten American 18-year-olds had a driver's license. Today it's six in ten. So it's not that surprising that on my 16th birthday I wasn't rushing to get a license. All I wanted was an IPhone, Juliet Schor (Sociology professor at Boston College) knows people of my age love being connected and for young people driving means they have to disconnect from their technology, and that's negative. So if they could sit in the passenger side and still be connected, that's going to be a plus. To me, another plus is ridesharing represents something much bigger than trying to save money. I see it as evidence that people still depend on each other. My generation shares their cars and apartments the way neighbors used to share cups of sugar. For the system to work, we still need our own cars. But until I get my own version of the silver Super Beetle, you can find me on twitter."	['people he knows']
Which of the following things is not supposed to happen during the Spring Festival?	"The Spring Festival is the biggest festival for Chinese people all around the world.. The celebration usually lasts for 15 days. There is a lot to do. On the eve of the Spring Festival, family members get together and have big meals. Their favourite dish on this day is dumplings. Days before the Spring Festival, families will clean their homes. People think cleaning sweeps away bad luck. It makes the house ready for good luck.

""" The cards can be recharged"" means that _ ."	"Some people in Manchester, Britain, will soon be paying for goods and services with so-called ""smart"" credit cards. These cards are more secure than the traditional magnetic-strip version and can be used to travel on buses, check bank accounts and do shopping. The Manchester project is one of the biggest smart card schemes in the world. Every time people use the cards on a bus or train, the fare is deducted (reduced) from the value of the card. When they have no credit left, the cards can be recharged at a local shop. A smart card looks just like a normal plastic card but it has a silicon chip in it. It is possible for the same silicon chip to perform a number of different functions, so one plastic card in your pocket could do a large number of different jobs. The card has much more memory space than a magnetic-strip card, so many more things can be recorded on it.There are two types of smart cards. One is the contact card which is used in the same way as a magnetic-strip card. Information is transferred by running the card through a narrow opening in an electronic reader. In the slot, electronic probes make contact with the magnetic-strip or silicon ship and read the information. The other type is the contactless smart card where the electronic reader communicates with the card by short-range radio waves. This makes the card quicker and more convenient to use because it does not have to leave your wallet. It is also more reliable as it is not easily influenced by scratches or dirt. However, the biggest advantage that smart cards have over magnetic-strip cards is that they are more secure. They are much more difficult to make than conventional cards and they have to be made by specially trained manufacturers. In addition, they have a large number of extra security features on them and if a smart card gets lost or stolen a quick phone-call to the distributor ensures that its individual number is made invalid and unreadable. This can be done more quickly than with a magnetic-strip card."	['the cards can be changed into new ones']
Which is TRUE according to the passage above?	"When the musical sound rings you, you immediately reach for your pocket ready to have a chat. But although you probably use it all the time, have you ever thought about the manners related to talking on the phone? If you haven't, here are some tips to guide you. *Always give the person you are calling plenty of time to get to the phone before you hang up. If the person who answers is not the one you want, give your name and ask if you may speak to the person you want. *Think about the time you call people. Try not to call too early in the morning (before about 9:00) or too late at night (after about 9:30). Also try not to call at mealtimes. *If you go by plane to visit your relatives at Christmas, remember to follow airline instructions. Cell phone must be turned off as soon as the plane doors are closed and remain so until the doors open again on arrival. *When you're face to face with someone, do not talk on the phone. It is rude to be on the phone when a waiter is trying to take your order in a restaurant, or when you are returning the shoes you have just been trying on in a shop. Finish any face-to-face business before taking a call. Continuing to use the phone while nodding to the person in front of you is quite impolite. *When in a restaurant with your friends, keep phone conversations short. Make a call only if it is important. Practice speaking in a low voice. If no one turns to your way, _ . *If you go to a theatre, a concert or a cinema, consider the other people around you. Check that your phone is ""off"" before you enter. If you are expecting a very important call, put your phone on ""vibrate"" and run for the exit as soon as you feel it. If you forget both ""off"" and ""vibrate"" and your phone rings, don't answer it, turn it off straight away."

Why did Oliver decide to try t'ai chi?	"Twenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer. But the injury led her to t'ai chi when Oliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the mysterious Chinese sport.""I was active and could not bear resting in bed and I thought I had to find some way to recover,""she recalls. She was struck by the beautiful movements and the""nice, patient instructor--Nelson"", who later became her husband. The couple opened a t'ai chi school in the UK. But they soon found themselves in a bottleneck. So the couple decided to move to China. They taught English in universities and learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared. But three years after moving to China to pursue their dream, Nelson died, bringing her much pain. She thought of quitting, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it. She says her t'ai chi""family""-- the masters and students -- also provided great support, including her then tutor Dong Bing. She speaks of their first meeting:""I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man. But my fellow pointed to a small, thin old gentleman, sitting on the ground. Then a sudden feeling of pleasure hit me. Of course this was exactly the kind of person who would be a t'ai chi master -- the last person you could imagine. His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but should endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others."" Following the master, Oliver now learns to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese. She does t'ai chi in the morning , makes kung fu tea for guests and draws ink-wash bamboo paintings. She spends her time outside t'ai chi attending cultural exchange events."	['She wanted to recover.']
Conservationists tend to explain that _ .	"The black and white bird came ashore on a beach in the south of the North Island nearly 4,000 miles away from its usual habitat. The creature's astonishing journey was witnessed by a woman walking her dog as the two-foot bird waddled out of the water in front of her. She said, ""It was out of this world to see it. It was this glistening white thing standing up on the sand and I thought I was seeing things."" The tale of the lost penguin is similar to the 2006 children's film Happy Feet, in which a young penguin finds himself far from home during a voyage of discovery. Conservationists believe it has completed an incredible journey for such a young bird -- it is estimated to be around 10 months old. The most likely explanation for its appearance in New Zealand is the hunt for food. Experts said it may also have rested on an ice floe during its travels and was carried north for a great distance before it made a swim for dry land. Colin Miskelly, a curator of New Zealand Museum, said, ""They can spend months at a time in the ocean and come ashore only to moult (,)or rest."" Mr. Miskelly said the brave bird would have to find its way back south soon if it was going to survive. He said, ""It is probably hot and thirsty and has been eating wet sand."" ""It doesn't realize that the sand isn't going to melt inside it because they typically eat snow -- their only liquid."" -- it can inflict painful bites if threatened."

How does Mr. Cool manage to travel the Information Highway so fast?	Passage 1 The Information Highway is the road that links computer users to a large number of on-line services: the Web,e-mail,and software,to mention just a few. Not long ago,the Information Highway was a new road,with not many users. Now,everyone seems to want to take a drive, with over 30 million families connected worldwide. Not surprisingly, this well-traveled highway is starting to look like a well-traveled highway. Traffic jams can cause many serious problems,forcing the system to close down for repair. Naturally,accidents will happen on such a crowded road,and usually victims are some files,gone forever. Then,of course,there' s Mr. Cool,with his new broad-band connection,who speeds down the highway faster than most of us can go. But don' t trick yourself:he pays for that speeding.

Why did the author decide to buy the Hollowell place?	At a certain time in our lives we consider every place as the possible site for a house.I have thus searched the country within a dozen miles of where I live.In imagination I have bought all the farms, one after another, and I knew their prices. The nearest thing that I came to actual ownership was when I bought the Hollowell place.But before the owner completed the sale with me, his wife changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me additional dollars to return the farm to him.However, I let him.keep the additional dollars and sold him the farm for just what I gave for it. The real attraction of' the Hollowell farm to me was its position, being about two miles from the village, half a mile from the nearest neighbor, bounded on one side by the river, and separated from highway by a wide field. The poor condition if the house and fences showed that it hadn't been used for some time.I remembered from my earliest trip up the river that the house used to be hidden behind a forest area, and I was in a hurry to buy it before the owner finished getting out some rocks, cutting down the apple trees, and clearing away some young trees which had grown up in the fields.I wanted to buy it before he made any more of his improvements.But it turned out as I have said. I was not really troubled by _ .I had always had a.garden, but I don't think I was ready for a large farm. I believe that as long as possible it is better to live free and uncommitted .It makes but little difference you own a farm or not.	['It was in a good position.']
Which of the following is true?	Some people have very good memory and they can easily remember quite long texts. There are other people who can only remember things when they have said them again and again. The famous English writer Charles Dickens said that he could walk down any long street in London and then tell you the name of every shop he had passed. Many great men of the world have a wonderful memory. A good memory is greatly helpful in learning a language. Everybody learns his own language by remembering what he hears when he is a small child, and some children, like the boys and girls who live abroad with their parents, seem to learn two languages almost as easily as one. In school it is not so easy to learn a second language because the students have so little time for it, and they are very busy with other subjects too. A man's mind is like a camera, but it takes photos not only of what we see but also of what we feel, hear, smell and taste. When we take a real photo with a camera, Some people have very good memory and they can easily remember quite long texts.In the same way, there is much work to be done before we can keep a picture forever in our minds. Memory is a diary, and we all carry it about us. We keep things we have experienced in this diary.	['Many people may never become great though they have a good memory.']
According to the author, one should run the London Marathon to _ .	"The London Marathon celebrates its 32nd birthday. That is 32 years of stresses and anxieties, blisters and painful knees, and tales that are hard to believe. Somehow, I've managed to run four of _ . And I have medals to prove it. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I watched the first London Marathon on March 29th, 1981. It seemed extraordinary that normal people would want to run 26 miles and 385 yards. And, it must be said that they looked strange and not quite steady at the end of it all. There are, indeed, terrible tales of people losing consciousness when they reach the finishing line. But it drew all my attention. I knew I had to do it. Three years later I was living in London, not far from Greenwich where the event begins, and it seemed the perfect opportunity to give it a go. I was only a short train ride from the starting line, but more than 26 miles from the finish. ""Who cares?"" I thought. By the end I did. The moment I crossed that finishing line and had that medal placed around my neck was one of the finest in my life. The sense of achievement was great. Knowing that I'd run a Marathon felt extremely good. London provides one of the easiest of all the officially approved marathons because most of its course is flat. Yes, there are the cobblestones while running through the Tower of London, and there are the quiet patches where crowds are thin and you are crying out for some encouragement -- those things matter to the ""fun"" runners like myself, but the serious runners don't think of such things. Since 1981,almost half a million people have completed the London Marathon, raising more than $ 125 million for charity. For the majority of the runners, this is what it is all about. It is for charity, for fun, for self-development. I have always loved it. It's crazy, and it's one of the greatest things I've ever done. If you want to feel as though you've achieved something, run a marathon."	['feel a sense of self-achievement']
Why did the author let the two children in?	"They stood outside the door - two children in shabby outgrown coats. ""Any old papers, lady?"" I was busy, I wanted to say no until I saw the snow on their clothes. And their little sandals were also covered with snow. ""Come in and I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa."" There was no conversation. Their wet sandals left marks upon the floor. I served them cocoa and toast with jam to strengthen them against the cold outside. Then I went back to the kitchen and started again on my household. The silence in the front room got me to look inside. The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a flat voice, ""Lady, are you rich?"" ""Am I rich? Mercy, no! "" I looked at my shabby sofa. The girl put her cup back in its saucer carefully. ""Your cups match your saucers, she said."" They left then, holding their bundles of papers against the wind. They hadn't said thank you. They didn't need to. They had done more than that. Plain blue cups and saucers. But they matched. I tasted the potatoes and looked at the meat. Potatoes and meat, the roof over my head, my man with a good steady job - these things matched, too. I moved the chairs back from the fire and tidied the living room. The muddy prints of small sandals were still wet upon my floor. I let them be. I wanted them there in case I ever forget again how very rich I am."	['To serve them some cocoa and food']

Where did Friedman use to work?	Ever thought of moving to a new country? How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated $ 500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people. Friedman is hoping to hand out the award in 2015.	['In Google.']

When factories were built, _ .	Long, long ago there were only a few thousand people in the world. These people move form place to place over the land, hunting animals for food. No one knows how or when these people learned about growing food. But when they did, their lives changed. They did not have to look for food any more. They could stay in one place and grow it. People began to live near one another. And so the first village grew. Many people came to work in the villages. These villages grew very big. When machines appeared , life in the villages changed again. Factories were built. More and more people lived near the factories. The cities grew very big. Today some people are moving back to small towns. Can you tell why?	['more people live near the factories']
What is the best title for the passage?	"Many people influenced various aspects of my life, based on their personal characteristics, accomplishments, and values. I have been fortunate to have had numerous teachers and professors who I respect for their patience and intelligence. There are artists that have inspired me by their natural talents and original creativity. I value many political leaders, who have inspired me by their contributions to society, and their ability to change our futures. But of all the people I have known in my life, the person I admire most is my father. As the youngest girl in my family, I always considered myself to be""Daddy's little girl"". While I grew up, it always made me sad to see so many of my friends and neighbors without a father or father-like figure around. This helped me appreciate how my father always takes an interest in his children's lives. In every aspect of my life my father continuously pushes me to _ , so I could accomplish my work outstandingly among my people. Whenever I feel like giving up, or have a question or a concern, I know I can always call on him for advice. _ His strength seems to be unbreakable during hard times, and he is extremely determined to accomplish anything he sets his mind on, no matter how tiny it is. I highly respect him for how he stands up for what he believes in, and will never back down. I have always admired his open mind, compassion for people, and sense of understanding. He is a very reserved man, but to everybody's surprise, he has a great sense of humor, and always knows how to put a smile on the faces of his wife, his children and his friends. Living in his affection and instruction, I am very proud of my father. He also professes how proud he is of his children, and is still there to support us in whatever we are involved in."

According to the text, women have tried to change their image by _ .	"Young women who take part in beauty contests are helping to keep alive an outdated opinion of women that a woman's most important value is how she looks. Women have been working very hard through the years to change their image. They have been trying to prove that the value of a woman does not lie only in her beauty. The world is just beginning to recognize that women are as smart, wise and strong in personality as men are, and that there are qualities more important than looks when judging people. When women take part in beauty contests for top prizes, they encourage people to value them for their beauty alone. It is unfair to say that beauty alone determines one's worth. Beauty contests not only encourage spectators to judge women by their appearance, but they encourage this idea in the contestants as well. These young women spend months losing weight to be the ""right"" size and learning how to dress, wear makeup, and walk just right so that some judges will consider them beautiful. I think it's great for a woman to feel good about her appearance, but looks shouldn't be sought after in an extreme or unreasonable way. There are too many other, more important, things in a young woman's life: learning, developing friendships and preparing for their future work and perhaps a family. As long as there are beauty contests, women won't be fully recognized as well-rounded human beings."	['proving they are as good as men']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the article?	"YOU'VE lost your keys and your parents are both busy. If you had to ask one of them for help, whom would you pick? Before you give your answer, you should probably know that a new study found that women are better than men at multitasking , especially if one of those tasks is searching for a lost item. That should help you choose. In the study, a team of UK researchers compared the performances of 120women and 120men in a computer game involving tasks of counting and shape-recognition Men and women were equally capable when tasks were handled one at a time. But when the tasks started switching quickly , men responded c) much slower than women. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were asked to complete a series of ""everyday challenges"" such as finding restaurants on a map and searching for a lost key in a field. Once again, women outperformed men on the test, particularly in the key-searching task. ""It suggests that- in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them,'' researcher Keith Law of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, told the BBC,[ln contrast,] men had a slight impulsiveness ;they jumped in too quickly"" But where did women get the ability to keep organized under pressure? Researchers believe that it has its roots in evolution ,In early human communities, women had to keep an eye on children while cooking meals. Meanwhile, men only needed to focus on hunting. Men might not be happy about this study. After all, many great pilots are men and they have to deal with lots of information at the same time too. This is true, and researchers have their response. ""[We don't mean]that all men can't multitask, or that only women can,"" said Laws.[We are saying that] the average woman is better able to organize her time and switch between tasks than the average man. There's no point denying these differences exist."""	['When the tasks started switching quickly in the test, the women in the study were more likely to take extra time to think.']

Why do we need friends according to the passage?	Everyone needs friends. Friends bring us happiness and hope in our lives. But the ability to make friends changes from person to person. To some people, making friends is easy, and to others it's very difficult. Making friends is a skill, and the first thing is to know how to get along with others. If you have trouble in making friends, maybe I can tell you how to do it. Realize your own good points. You have skills and talents that others will like. Believe that you are a good person and have something nice to share with others. Be humorous. Learn to laugh at yourself and your weakness. Remember to smile to others. Respect others. Everyone has his own idea. Learn how to listen to others' ideas without trying to make them accept yours. Be kind. If you are kind to others, they will usually be kind to you. There are hundreds of little things you can do to show kindness. Open the door for someone. Wave to a friend and so on. Don't complain. Learn to accept what you can't change, and work hard to change what you can. No one is willing to hear your complaining all the time. Never give up. Even if you are faced with some closed-minded people, never give up. And try to find someone who will understand you.	['Friends can bring us happiness.']
The only way for James to earn money was to _ .	"James shook his money box again. Nothing! He carefully counted the coins that lay on the bed. $24. 17 was all that he had. The bicycle he wanted was at least $90! How was he going to get the end of the money? He knew that his friends all had bicycles. It was hard to hang around with people when you were the only one without wheels. He thought about what he could do. It was no use asking his parents, for he knew they had no money to save. There was only one way to get money, and that was to earn it. He would have to find a job. But who would hire him and what could he do? He decided to ask Mr. Clay for advice, who usually had opinions on most things. ""Well, you can start right here,"" said Mr. Clay. ""My windows need cleaning and my car needs washing. "" That was the beginning of James' part-time job. For three months he worked every day after finishing his homework. He was amazed by the different kinds of jobs that people found for him to do. He took dogs and babies for walks, cleared out cupboards, and mended books. He lost count of the number of cars he washed and windows he cleaned, but the money increased and he knew that he would soon have enough for the bicycle he was eager to have. The day finally came when James counted his money and found $94. 32. He wasted no time and went down to the shop to pick up the bicycle he wanted. He rode proudly home, looking forward to showing his new bicycle to his friends. It had been hard working for the money, but James knew that he valued his bicycle far more since he had bought it with his own money."	['find a part-time job']
Why did John's mother decide to move to Chicago?	"John H. Johnson was born in a black family in Arkansas City in 1981. His father died in an accident when John was six. He was reaching the high school age, but his hometown offered no high school for blacks. Fortunately he had a strong--willed caring mother. John remembered that his mother told him many times, ""Son, you can be anything you want really to be if you just believe."" She told him not to depend on others, including his mother. ""You have to learn success"" she said. ""All the people who work hard don't succeed, but the only people who do succeed are those who work hard."" These words, came from a woman with less than a third grade education. She also knew that believing and hard work don't mean everything. So she worked hard as a cook for two years to save enough to take her son, who was then 15, to Chicago. Chicago in 1933 was not the promised land that black southerners were looking for. John's mother and stepfather could not find work. But here John could go to school, and here he learned the power of words--as an editor of the newspaper and yearbook at Du Sable High School. His wish was to publish a magazine for blacks. While others discouraged him, John's mother offered him more words to live by ""Nothing beats a failure but a try."" She also let him pawn her furniture to get the $ 500 he needed to start the Negro magazine. It is natural that difficulties and failures followed john closely until he become very successful. He always keeps his mother's words in mind:"" Son, failure is not in your vocabulary!"" Now John H. Johnson is one of the 400 richest people in America--worth $150 million."

According to the passage, besides newspapers, people also get information from _ .	Reading newspapers has become an important part of everyday life. Some people read newspapers as the first thing to do in the morning, others read newspapers as soon as they have free time during the day so that they can learn what is happening in the world. Sometimes, we do not have enough time to read all the news carefully, so we just take a quick loot at the front page. At other times, we may be in such a hurry that we only have a few minutes to look at the headlines of te passage. Newspapers can be found everywhere in the world. We can get many different kinds of newspapers in big cities, but in some mountain villages we can see few newspapers. Some newspapers are published once a week, but most of the papers are published once a day with many pages, some even published twice a day!

The operations centre will first _ after receiving an alarm.	"Speeding off in a stolen car, the thief thinks he has got a great catch.But he is in for an unwelcome surprise.The car is fitted with a remote immobilizer, and a radio signal from a control centre miles away will ensure that once the thief switches the engine off, he will not be able to start it again. The idea goes like this.A control box fitted to the car contains a mini-cellphone, a micro-processor and memory, and a GPS satellite positioning receiver.If the car is stolen, a coded cellphone signal will tell the control centre to block the vehicle's engine management system and prevent the engine being restarted. In the UK, a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves."" ,"" says Martyn Randall, a security expert.He says it would only take him a few minutes to teach a person how to steal a car, using a bare minimum of tools.But only if the car is more than 10 years old. Modern cars are far tougher to steal, as their engine management computer won't allow them to start unless they receive a unique ID code sent out by the ignition key.In the UK, technologies like this have helped achieve a 31% drop in vehicle-related crime since 1997. But determined criminals are still managing to find other ways to steal cars, often by getting hold of the owner's keys.And key theft is responsible for 40% of the thefts of vehicles fitted with a tracking system. If the car travels 100 metres without the driver confirming their ID, the system will send a signal to an operations centre that it has been stolen.The hundred metres minimum avoids false alarms due to inaccuracies in the GPS signal. Staff at the centre will then contact the owner to confirm that the car really is missing, and keep police informed of the vehicle's movements via the car's GPS unit."	['contact the car owner']
The writer suggests that if the number of official languages was reduced, _ .	"Language is a major problem for the European Union (EU) . The Treaty of Rome ,which created the organization that finally became the EU, stated that each country's language must be treated equally. The original six countries had only three languages between them: French, German and Dutch/Flemish. However, there are now 15 countries in the EU, with a total of 12 languages. EU documents must be translated into all these languages, and at official meetings the speeches must be translated into all the languages by interpreters. All this translating is very expensive and time-consuming. It is said that nearly half of all employees of the EU are engaged in translating documents and speeches and nearly half of the EU's administrative costs are spent on this task. In the near future it is probable that several more countries, most of them having their own languages, will join the EU, thus making the situation even worse. The problem is just cost; there are practical difficulties as well. With 12 languages, there are 132 possible ""translation situations"" that might be needed. It is often difficult to find people in the right place at the right time who can translate from, for example, Danish into Greek, or Dutch into Portuguese, at a high professional standard. In practice the problem has been less serious by the use of English in many contacts between EU officials , since almost all of them speak some English. However, any move to reduce the number of official languages (perhaps to four or five) would be a blow to the pride of the smaller countries. Another commonly suggested solution is to make English the official language for all EU business. However, this is strongly resisted by powerful member countries like France and Germany ."

Which of the following is the most important in creating new ideas?	"Since the pre-historic times, man has had an urge to satisfy his needs.For food, shelter or a mate, he has always controlled the circumstances to the best of his advantages.Probably this might be the reason why we human are the most developed of all living beings on the earth, and probably also in the universe.As we climbed the steps of evolution, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking--we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of time. If you are hungry, what do you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things.So it silently began to pay attention to your needs and never let itself grow.When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading.Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to get help from reading.You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all, your ""How to?"" questions.Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but even your mind decodes it and explains it to you.The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas.The same seed if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would never have thought in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity.The larger number of books you read, your mind will open up like never before.Also this improves your speaking skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary.Within no time you start speaking English or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time. Actually, I had a problem in sped king English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly.I am still on the path of improvement.So, give food to your thoughts by reading."

According to the text, who are supposed to be in the express line?	"Since I started working part-time at a grocery store, I have learned that a customer is more than someone who buys things. To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely once he or she starts to push a shopping cart. One of the first things customers forget is how to count. There is no other way to explain how so many people get in their express line, which is clearly marked 15 items or less, with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items. Customers also forget why they came to the store in the first place. Just as I finish ringing up an order, a customer will say, ""Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread. I hope you don't mind waiting, while I go to get it.""Five minutes later, he's back with the bread, a bottle of milk, and three rolls of paper towels. What is strange is that customers also seem to forget that they have to pay for their groceries. Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card while I am ringing up the groceries, a customer will wait until I announce the total. Then, in surprise, she says, "" Oh no, what did I do with my check book?"" After 5 minutes of digging through her purse, she borrows my pen because she has forgotten hers. But I have to tolerate customers because they pay my salary, and that's something I can't afford to forget."	['Customers with not more than 15 items.']

But it seems not easy to be on time every time. Here are some useful methods to help you be punctual. Plan your route. If your destination is unfamiliar, go online the night before to map out your route and see how long it's going to take. Then you will know when you have to leave the house. Do as much as possible the night before. Make your mornings less stressful by doing what you can the night before to make your time enough. Get your clothes ready. Set the breakfast table. Make your lunch if you need to take it. Make a time table. You need to make a time table if you have lots of things to do in a day. For example, the time you get up, the time you leave the house, and the time you wait for the bus. You also need to estimate how long it takes. Give yourself a gift of being early. If you plan to get to your destination 15 minutes early, you'll probably never be late again. Being early seems a waste of time. But you can do something you love. Read the newspaper, read your favorite blogs and even call a friend. It really can be a gift.	['four']

Yearner position - This position says that you are open-minded and eager to face challenges. 4. Soldier position - These sleepers lie on their backs with their arms down and close to the body. They are usually reserved and quiet. 5. Freefall position - People who sleep in this position are outgoing but feel a lack of control in their lives. This is the least comfortable position. 6. Starfish position - People who sleep like this are good listeners, helpful, and uncomfortable being the center of attention.	['Sleeping position reflects personality.']
What can we learn from the passage?	"A new weapon is on the way in the fight against smoking in Europe. Soon when smokers buy cigarettes they might see a shocking photo of a blackened lung or a cancer patient staring back at them from the packet. Some boys may think of smoking as cool and sexy. Their friends won't agree when they see their packets of cigarettes lying on the table. The European Union announced on October 22, that it had chosen 42 photos that showed the damage cigarettes could do to the body. It called on member nations to put these pictures on packets to discourage smokers. To catch the attention of teenagers, the special packets warn of long-term medical dangers, like cancer. Short-term effects, like bad skin, are also on the list. ""The true face of smoking is disease, death and horror. That is the message we should send to the young,"" said David Byrne, an EU health official. ""Hopefully these pictures will shock students out of their love for cigarettes.""[:ZSSxxSSk.Com] The EU head office hoped the pictures would work better than current written warnings on packs of cigarettes. The warnings included ""smoking kills"" and ""smoking can lead to a slow and painful death."" So far, Ireland and Belgium have shown interest in the photos. Canada has used similar pictures and warnings on cigarette packs since 2000. The country has recently seen a fall in the number of smokers. According to studies, smoking is the single biggest cause of avoidable death in EU. Every year more than 650,000 smokers die, more than one person a minute."

Why does the number of grizzly bears get smaller, according to the text?	Could a grizzly bear move to your neighborhood? If you live in the U.S. West, the answer may be yes. People and grizzly bears are living closer together now. The grizzly bear is one of the largest meat-eating land animals in North America. In the early 1800s, about 50,000 grizzly bears lived there. Today there're far fewer bears. Settlers built cities and roads where bears lived. Many bears were hunted and killed. Now only 1,200 to 1,400 grizzly bears have remained. In and around Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears have been making a comeback because of people's efforts to protect them. Some bears are moving to areas where people live. People are also moving into grizzly countries. People there have to learn how to live with their new, furry neighbors peacefully. If someone leaves their barbecue grill out overnight, or leaves their pet food or rubbish where a bear can get it, the bear will learn to come to their house for food. Grizzly bears that learn to eat people's food can become dangerous, and they often have to be killed or moved. Also, it's important not to surprise a grizzly. Besides, if you are hiking in a grizzly country, you should go with others and make a noise to make bears hear your coming and get out of the way. You may not want to invite grizzly bears to your next neighborhood party, but with a little effort, grizzly bears and people can live together peacefully.

Which of the following statements is TRUE about the athletes at the closing ceremony?	Two weeks after the opening ceremony, the Games are over. The last of the three hundred gold medals has been awarded and the flags of the winners have been raised for the last time. The final event is the closing ceremony. This occasion is always sad and happy at the same time. It is a sad occasion because the tremendous excitement is over, and it will not happen again for four years. Those who have made friends will have to say goodbye, perhaps for ever. It is also a happy occasion because the competition is over and the athletes can really show their friendship for one another. The closing ceremony is rather like the opening. But now the Olympic flame goes out and the Olympic flag, with its five rings, is lowered.

The detail that their conversation was frequently interrupted is mentioned in order to show _ .	I had arrived at the airport to catch an early flight home.It had been a very busy three days for me on an interstate trip with lots of meetings,business to do and new customers to meet.Then came the announcement that the flight had been delayed due to a technical problem.I could see a group of technicians and ground staff rushing about,obviously trying hard to fix the problem.I watched and listened as many of the passengers sitting near me shared their frustration about the inconvenience. As I sat waiting,I reflected on my last meeting for the day.It was not a business meeting but rather a very enjoyable and brief lunch with an old business associate and friend I had not seen for over 12 years,and who I had worked with for nearly 15 years before we lost in touch.I had been given his phone number by a customer I had visited on the first day of my trip,so I called him out of the blue and made a time for us to meet. Our lunch was spent recollecting times gone by and as well filling each other in on what had happened in our lives over the last 12 years.Our conversation was frequently interrupted with statements such as 'remember when we did...','whatever happened to...' and of course the one we all liked to hear...'you know you haven't changed one bit,except for a few more grey hairs.' We both laughed and smiled as we recalled the good times and the great experiences we had shared over the 15 years we had worked together. Each event we discussed caused another recollection and everything we talked about centered on the good times.Almost at the same time,right at the end of our time together,we both said how much we both enjoyed it and that we must do it again.We agreed to catch up when I was next in town,then said our goodbyes and I was off to the airport. So with this extra time on my hands as I waited for my flight,it was great to revisit and replay in my mind all that we had talked about over lunch.I realized at that moment just how important it is to have regular reminders of the good times in your life and to be able to take the time to recall the past,for so much of what we have done in our past,shapes us and makes us who and what we are today and beyond. At the end of my busy trip with the focus on getting all the business done,I was indeed fortunate enough to have had the chance to take a short break and reflect on the good things that had happened in my life over 12 years ago.It was somewhat like looking at an old photo album that you have found stored away in a cupboard in your house.There before your eyes are lots of wonderful memories in print that take you back to that time and place,and most importantly to those people who are in the photos.It also made me realize that when you get caught up doing what has to be done in the moment,it is easy to forget the people you have met in your life who have made a positive effect on and enriched you,often in only the smallest of ways. My flight home was finally called nearly three hours later and yes as you would have expected many of the passengers cheered when the announcement was made.I smiled as I boarded the plane and realized that I was not at all upset about the delay,as I had been able to spend much of my time reflecting on the good times from days gone by and now eagerly look forward to many more opportunities to recall the past.

We can infer from the passage that	Sometime in the next century, the familiar early-newspaper on the front porch will disappear. And instead of reading your newspaper, it will read to you. You'll get up and turn on the computer newspaper just like switching on the TV An electronic voice will distribute stories about the latest events, guided by a program that selects the type of news you want. You'll even get to choose the kind of voice you want to hear. Want more information on this brief story? A simple touch makes the entire text appear. Save it in your own personal computer if you like. These are among the predictions from communication experts working on the newspapers of the future. Pictured as part of broader home-based media and entertainment systems, computer newspapers will unite print and broadcast reporting, and offer news and analysis with video images of news events. Most of the technology is available now, but convincing more people that they don't need to read a newspaper is the next step. But resistance to computer newspapers may be stronger from within journalism. Since it is such a cultural change, it may be that the present generation of journalists and publishers will have to die off before the next generation realizes that the newspaper industry is no longer a newspaper industry. Technology is making the end of ' traditional newspapers unavoidable. Despite technological advances, it could take decades to replace newsprint with computer screens. It might take 30 t0 40 years to complete the changeover because people need to buy computers and because newspapers have established financial interests in the paper industry.

After the students come back _ .	"Colleges may try to do a lot to prepare students for study abroad - telling about culture shock, warning about homesickness, recommending books about the country. But when it comes to adjusting to campus life when they return, schools haven't done as much, even though the transition is sometimes almost as difficult. ""They can feel disoriented and depressed. They find things are not exactly the way they were when they left,"" said Antonio Jimenez, director of the Center for International Affairs at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, California, US. ""They find that people don't care much about their experiences."" Some colleges are now rethinking their approach to study abroad, recognizing that students might need almost as much help adjusting to life back home as they did getting ready to leave: students experience a sort of reverse culture shock when they return to the US. They might be troubled by the wealth and waste they see back home or they might feel homesick for their new country and its customs. And when they try to talk about their experiences, people quickly lose interest, especially if they haven't lived abroad themselves. Down the road, they also might find it difficult to translate their time abroad into experience that an employer finds attractive. Some California universities have organized conferences to help students make the most of their time abroad. During a one-day event, students learn how to adjust after living abroad, talk about their experiences and incorporate them into their lives and future careers. Blythe Cherney, 22, a senior who has studied in Thailand and Britain, found the _ helpful. ""Any experience abroad does have an effect on you,"" Cherney said. ""When you come back, it's important to talk about it, especially with people who know what you've been through."" Yet most universities focus more on preparation than reorientation. When students return, they might have a welcome home reception. But for the most part, universities figure students can fend for themselves."	['They are confused and disappointed.']
What can be learnt about the new study from the passage?	"Moving to a new town or even a new neighborhood is stressful at any age, but a new study shows that frequent moves in childhood are related to poorer well-being in adulthood, especially among people who are more introverted or neurotic . The researchers tested the relationship between the number of childhood moves and well-being in a sample of 7108 American adults who were followed for 10 years. ""We know that children who move frequently are more likely to perform poorly in school and have more behavioral problems,"" said the study's lead author Shigehiro Oishi. ""However, the long-term effects of moving on well-being in adulthood have been overlooked by researchers."" The study's participants, who were between the ages of 20 and 75, were contacted in 1994 and 1995 and were surveyed again 10 years later. They were asked how many times they had moved as children, as well as about their psychological well-being, personality type and social relationships. The researchers found that the more times people moved as children, the more likely they were to report lower life satisfaction and psychological well-being at the time they were surveyed. The research also showed that those who moved frequently as children had fewer quality social relationships as adults. The researchers also looked to see if different personality types affected frequent movers' well-being. Among introverts, the more moves participants reported as children, the worse off they were as adults. ""Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to keep long-term close relationships."" Said Oishi. ""This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily."" The findings showed neurotic people who moved frequently reported less life satisfaction and poorer psychological well-being than people who did not move as much and people who were not neurotic. However, the number and quality of neurotic people's relationships had no effect on their well-being, no matter how often they had moved as children. In the article, Oishi thinks this may be because neurotic people have more negative reactions to stressful life events in general. ""We can guess that moving often creates more stress,"" Oishi said. ""But we need more research on this link before we can conclude that moving often in childhood can, in fact, be dangerous to your health in the long-term."""

Why did the writer tell us the story of 7-year-old Johnny?	"A famous study was done in a school by a professor from a university. At the start of the school year, the teachers were given the names of five children. They were told that these five were the most excellent students in the class. But the fact was that these students were only average ,and they were not the best students at all. Well, guess what? At the end of the year, all the five average students scored among the highest in the class. What made these average students change so much to become top students?The only difference was the change in their teachers' attitude . Because the teachers believed that these five kids were the top students,they expected more from them. And so these five average students began to believe and expect more from themselves. So they worked harder to do as well as they could. Do you know why? If you expect the best from people, they'll usually want to give you their best. A great leader said, ""Treat a person just how he appears to be on the outside, and you'll make him even worse. But treat a person like he's already a success,and you'll help make him the best he can be."" Like the true story of 7-year-old Johnny, his teacher got so angry with him that one day she said,""Johnny,you're the naughtiest boy in this class. I'm sure you'll never change."" The next year Johnny had a new teacher. And on the first day of class,she met with Johnny after school and said,""Johnny, I've heard a lot about you! But do you know that I don't believe a word of it."" And every day after that, this new teacher treated Johnny as if he was one of the smartest students even when Johnny did naughty things. Later on, Johnny became a school leader. Because that's the power of our belief and attitude toward children."	['To show the importance of encouragement.']
How did the air in London become much cleaner?	"London used to be ""foggy"" for the same reason that cities like Beijing' or Chongqing are ""foggy~ today. The ""fog was in fact smog, a mixture of smoke and fog. In other words, it was made by air pollution In London, some of this pollution came from factories, but much of it came from the coal that people burnt in their houses to keep warm during the winter. By the 1950s, London's smog problem had become so bad that the-government decided to do something to clean the air. A new law was made and nobody could bum coal in any British city. Within a few years, the air became much cleaner. There were no more "" _ "". . Many Chinese cities now face the same sort of' problem with air pollution that . London faced 40 0r 50 years ago. However, this problem is more difficult for Chinese cities to solve One reason is that more of the pollution comes from the factories, rather than from coal burnt in people's houses If these factories were closed, this would harm the economy and lots of people would lose their jobs. Another reason is that changing from coal to cleaner fuel , like gas, is quite expensive. However, the air in many Chinese cities is becoming cleaner and cleaner, as the government and people pay more and more attention to cutting down pollution . As a result,there are fewer ""pea-soupers"" in Beijing than there used to be. ."	['A law was made to keep people from burning coal in their houses.']
After having the injection, the author's _ .	"One morning, I stepped out of bed and put my feet on the floor. Suddenly, a mean little man jumped out from under the bed and stabbed (,) an ice pick through my left foot. Figuratively speaking, yes. I took another step and he stabbed it again. This went on all day. Step, stab, scream. Over the next few days, I started limping . My whole body hurt. Even my hair. I kept thinking that the little man would get tired of stabbing me and go pick on somebody else.We often take things for granted until we lose them or they start to hurt. My brother deals with pain every day. He's also blind and suffers from cerebral palsy , needs a walker to walk, doesn't take much for granted. I had to wonder: What would he think about my foot? Finally, after a week of pain, I went to see a very nice foot doctor. The doctor studied my foot, took X-rays, shook his head, and said the little man's name: Arthur Itis, or Arthritis . I knew it well. I'd often heard it hissed angrily by my grandparents and parents, all attacked by Arthur's ice pick when they got older. ""Wait,"" I said. ""Doesn't Arthur usually just pick on old people?"" The doctor smiled, looking at my chart. ""How old are you?"" I gave him a look. ""Never mind,"" I said. ""Can you fix it?"" ""Well,"" he said, ""we can try."" He listed several options and I chose the injection . It didn't hurt much. Not half as much as the ice pick. That was yesterday. This morning, I awoke, took a few careful steps and ... hallelujah!It hurt just a bit, but no ice pick. I looked under the bed. No sign of Arthur. Maybe he was hiding in the closet, waiting for another day.But for now, he was gone, and I was grateful.My mind began to race with plans to do all the things I'd been putting off for days:unpack, clean the house, wash my hair ... Then it hit me. Another stab. Not in my foot. In my heart. I remembered that I hadn't called my brother in a long time. It's easy to take some things for granted. But it should never be the people we love."	['was first satisfied with her recovery']
We can learn from Paragraphs 2 and 3 that the father _ .	"""Dad,"" I say one day .....take a trip. Why don't you fly and meet me?"" My father had just reired...........

While he tied a tie and put on the same Swiss watch, I rowed a boat across Lake of the Ozarks. My father sees me drfting aimlessly, nothing to show for my 33 years but a passport full of funny stamps. He wants me to settle down, but now I want him to find an adventure. He agrees to travel with me through the national parks. We meet four weeks later in Rapid City. "" What is our first stop?"" asks my father. ""What time is it?"" ""Still don't have a watch?"" Less than an hour away is Mount Rushmore. As he stares up at the four Presidents carved in granite , his mouth and eyes open slowly, like those of little boy. ""Unbelievable,"" he says, ""How was this done?"" A film in the information center shows sculptor Gutzon Borglum devoted 14 years to the sculpture and then left the final touches to his son. We stare up and I ask myself, Would I ever devote my life to anything? No directions, ...... I always used to hear those words in my father's voice. Now I hear them in my own.

Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?	"The US will have a new president this fall. Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans. But the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing. This is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents. ""Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,"" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. ""But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes , they care about schools and the community."" Many believe that the civic education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote. Students usually just do community services like cleaning the neighborhoods. This means they haven't learned how to link real life problems to politics through voting, according to Christopher Beem, a politics professor at the Pennsylvania State University. He said the country needs to help young people learn how to take part in politics and get them to see that they can make a difference."	['US Young Not Voting']
What advice does the author give to those who want to be fashion designers?	Looking good, feeling good Born to a model mom and a suit maker dad, fashion was actually in my blood. I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd. I made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old. A friend's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker. In high school I started making my own clothes, mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it. During the last two years of school, I worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing and bags. The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place. Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting. From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started. For my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand-made and one-of-a-kind, specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me. Every morning I jumped out of bed, went to my studio and worked on my projects. This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work. And at night I even dreamed of new designs! Fashion design is _ art. What I mean is that it's something close to you and something you can touch and feel, and actually interact with. My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on, such as sewing and pattern-making. Even if you end up specializing, it's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes. Also, if you dream of having your own clothing line, the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes. You have to try and do this because that's the way you're going to develop something that's all yours and unlike anyone else's. I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence.	['Deciding what is unique about their clothes.']
We learn from the reading that _ .	"When we think of Hollywood, we think of films and famous film stars. They are part of Hollywood' s history. Today people make films in other places, too. Not all famous film stars live in Hollywood. But Hollywood is still a very special part in Los Angeles, California. You can easily see where Hollywood is in Los Angeles. There is a big sign on the hills. It says ""HOLLYWOOD"". The white letters are fifty feet tall. You can see the sign from far away. The Hollywood sign is a famous Hollywood landmark in Los Angeles. Many postcards show this famous Hollywood landmark. In the hills of Hollywood, there is also the Hollywood Bowl. This is an open-air theatre. It is one of the biggest open-air theatres in the world. It has seventeen thousand seats and a very different stage . The design of the stage was by a great American called Fran Lioyd Wright. You can listen to all kinds of concerts at the Hollywood Bowl."

What is the author's purpose of writing this passage?	I have many new teachers in high school, but Lori Runkle, my English Language and Composition teacher, is my favorite teacher. Ms. Runkle enjoys getting to know more about students, so I have many chances to talk with her after class. I have always wanted to become a journalist . Since Ms. Runkle used to be a journalist back in the United States, she has introduced many helpful journalistic writing skills to me. Although she is my teacher, Ms. Runkle and I are more like friends. She often invites my classmates and me to take part in different activities outdoors. For example, I went to listen to a journalist's speech, which helped me better understand current events . Not only does Ms. Runkle talk with me outside of school, she is also a great teacher in the classroom. English Language and Composition is a really hard subject for a second language learner. We felt worried in the beginning, but Ms. Runkle really makes an effort to help us out. In class, Ms. Runkle always encourages students to question everything to keep us active. One part of class I love the most is when groups of students are requested to give speeches on events that are happening in the world. It requires a lot of deep thinking and I really learn quite a lot from it. I love Ms. Runkle very much. She not only helps me to get good scores, but also acts as a good friend and always gives me advice on life.	['To describe an unforgettable teacher.']
How many players are on the court in the match?	"Imagine that the rules of volleyball forbid the use of hands or arms---that's sepaktakraw . It's a difficult sport, but that isn't stopping the world from picking it up. The court where sepaktakraw is played is the size of one used for badminton doubles. A net and a plastic ball a little larger than a baseball are used. Two teams of three players(left inside, right inside, and server) take their places on either side. A teammate passes the ball to the server who kicks it over the net. Points are scored when the ball touches the court surface on the other side. How sepaktakraw began has been a hot topic. Many Asian cultures once had their own names and rules for it. In Thailand the sport can be found on a famous mural . It was also played to celebrate the writing of the nations' first constitution in 1933. however, various nations discussed to decide the official name and rules in 1960, At last, sepak is a Malay word for ""kick"", and takraw is Thai for ""woven ball"". International tournaments have been held for many years, but sepaktakraw continues to improve. It was introduced as an exhibition event at the 2009 World Games in Kaohsiung. And though no other countries can b equal to Thailand in sepaktakraw, they will show improvement. Twenty-five continents on five continents now claim active teams that play internationally. Finally, a place in the Olympic Games is also being sought. If these changes continue, sepaktakraw may soon be familiar to all."	['6']
How many persons asked the driver about the time?	"A driver stopped his car on a street side to have a rest. As he lay down in the seat and closed his eyes, a person came up and knocked at the window to ask the time. The driver opened his eyes and looked at his watch: ""It's 8:05,"" he said. Then he went to sleep again. But soon he was waken up again because a second person was knocking at the window. ""Sir, do you know the time?"" he asked. The driver looked at his watch again, and told him it was half past eight. In this way, the driver thought he could not have a good rest, so he wrote a short note and stuck it on the window for all to see. It said, ""I don't know the time."" Again, he lay down in the seat for his sleep. A few minutes later, a third person came and began to knock at the window, ""Hey, sir,"" he said. ""It's a quarter to nine."" ,."	['Two.']
What was Henry Ford's dream according to the text?	"Many people believe Henry Ford invented the automobile . But Henry Ford did not start to build his first car until 1896. That was eleven years after two Germans developed the world's first automobile. Many people believe Henry Ford invented the production line that moved a car's parts to the worker, instead of making the worker move to the parts. That is not true, either. Many factory owners used methods of this kind before Ford. What Henry Ford did was to use other people's ideas and make them better. And he made the whole factory a moving production line. In the early days of the automobile, almost every car maker raced his cars. It was the best way of gaining public notice. Henry Ford decided to build a racing car. Ford's most famous race was his first one. It was also the last race in which he drove the car himself. The race was in 1901, at a field near Detroit. All of the most famous cars had entered, but only two were left: the Winton and Ford's. The Winton was famous for its speed. Most people thought the race was over before it began. The Winton took an early lead. But halfway through the race, it began to lose power. Ford started to gain. And near the end of the race, he took the lead. Ford won the race and defeated the Winton. His name appeared in newspapers and he became wellknown all over the United States.Within weeks of the race, Henry Ford formed a new automobile company. In 1903, a doctor in Detroit bought the first car from the company. _ was the beginning of Henry Ford's dream. Ford said: ""I will build a motor car for a great number of people. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for one person to operate and care for. It will be built of the best materials. It will be built by the best men to be employed. And it will be built with the simplest plans that modern engineering can produce. It will be so low in price that no man making good money will be unable to own one."" The Model T was a car of that kind. It only cost $850. It was a simple machine that drivers could depend on. Doctors bought the Model T. So did farmers. Even criminals. They considered it the fastest and surest form of transportation. Americans loved the Model T. They wrote stories and songs about it. Thousands of Model T's were built in the first few years."

MSF is a famous _ .	MSF stands for Medicines Sans Frontiers. It's also known as Doctors Without Borders . Medicines Sans Frontiers is French. This organization was set up by some French doctors in 1971. Since then, MSF has sent trained doctors all over the world to help people who have suffered from disasters, such as wars and illness. Now, about 3,000 doctors and nurses work for MSF. And over 27,000 doctors have volunteered for MSF so far. The organization received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999. All kinds of doctors can volunteer for MSF. They need to be ready to go almost anywhere in the world and, of course, they should face difficulties. Most of MSF's work is in Africa. When MSF chooses doctors for a task, they have to go for at least six months. When doctors have completed a few tasks and become experienced, they might be sent on an emergency task following a disaster, such as an earthquake. But why would doctors leave a comfortable life and a good pay to join MSF? Some of them say the experience they have is a great help in their life. And they say that it's great to give others a helping hand. MSF needs support. They get donations from the government and businesses. But 80% of its donations come from doctors themselves.

What is most essential for draftsmen's work according to the author?	If you try to explain to someone, without using pictures, how to build the building that you have designed, it would take an enormous amount of writing and might end up with a very funny-looking building. The architect uses pictures called details to show how many hundreds of parts go together to form a complete building. This type of drawing is called drafting and is done by people called draftsmen. Draftsmen make up the largest group of the architectural offices' work force. Because of the wide range of duties they perform, draftsmen are sometimes called architectural technicians. In a typical office, there are not only career draftsmen but also architectural graduates working as junior draftsmen to learn the trade. Career draftsmen are usually graduates from a two-year junior college called technical school. There was a time when architectural office used young people right out of high school as tracers. Their job was to trace over the other people's details while learning to be a draftsman. This is no longer possible with the fast-pace of architects' offices today although a junior draftsman is given guides by the more experienced employees. So a good comprehensive architectural drafting course is a must before anyone seeks a job with an architectural firm. The job of the draftsmen is to translate the ideas and directions of architects, designers and engineers into complete and accurate working drawings. These become the plans and details used in the actual construction of a building. The project must be shown in great detail and drawn very clearly, so there is no chance for misunderstanding by the contractors . Every line and figure has an effect on the finished product. As you can see, the draftsman is a key member of the architectural team. Of course, a junior draftsman is not expected to produce a complete set of working drawings. Depending on the size of the office and difficulty of the project, draftsmen may work in groups. The group leader coordinates the group and works closely with the project architect while the drawings are being produced. Working conditions are mostly very pleasant as draftsmen's work is intense and many people depend on accurate work. Each draftsman has a large combination drawing board and desk with various drawing aids. Almost without exception, members of the architectural team have at one time in their careers worked as draftsmen. This is essential to an architect education and most architects never get very far away from the drafting board.	['Accuracy in the drawings.']
Why did critics think engineered trees dangerous? Because _ .	"Special trees that grow faster, fight pollution, produce better wood, and even sense chemical attacks are being planted by scientists in the US. When 40 per cent of Hawaii's US$14 million-a-year papaya industry was destroyed by a virus five years ago, work began on creating genetically engineered trees. Researchers successfully introduced seeds that were designed to resist the virus.Since then, more and more people have been testing genetically engineered trees.Some researchers put special bacteria into trees to help them grow faster and produce better wood.Others are trying to create trees that can clean polluted soil.Meanwhile fruit farmers are looking for trees that are strong enough to resist worms, and paper companies want trees that produce more wood and therefore more paper. The Pentagon even gave the researchers US$500,000 this year after they developed a pine tree that changes its colours if it senses a chemical attack.So far, the poplar, eucalyptus , apple and coffee trees are among those being engineered.All this can be done today because we have a better understanding of tree genomes . However, some people fear that the genetically engineered trees will cause dangerous results.They are worried that the new trees will breed with natural species and change the balance of the forest environment. ""It could be destructive,"" said Jim Diamond, an environmentalist. ""Trees are what is left of our natural environment and home to many endangered species."" But researchers insist that science could give nature a fighting chance against both natural and man-made dangers.They hope to answer the critics by stopping the new trees from breeding, so their effect on the environment can be controlled."

A tree grows a new layer of wood _ .	How much rain has fallen on the earth in the past? Man has not always kept weather records. Because scientists need a way to learn about past rainfall, they study the tree rings. A tree's trunk keeps growing year by year. Under its bark , a tree adds a layer of new wood each year it lives. If you look at a tree stump, you can see the layers. They are called annual ring . On some trees, all of the rings are of the same width. But the ponderosa that grows in the American southwest have rings in different withes. The soil in he southwest is dry. The pines depend on rainfall for water. In a year of good rainfall, they form wide rings. In a dry year, they form narrow ones. Scientists do not have to cut down a pine to study its rings. With a special tool, they remove a narrow piece of wood from the trunk without harming the tree. Then they look at the width of each ring to see how much rain fell in the year it formed.

One disadvantage is that you often have to live closer to other people than you would like to. Sometimes, your neighbors make a noise that you are not comfortable with. The best way to solve this problem is to talk with your neighbor first. You should be very polite and ask your neighbor if he knows how thin the walls of your homes are. This way doesn't criticize his behavior ; it simply points out that he may not realize how far his sound travels. Tell him that you know that sometimes you make noise as well, but that you do your best to keep it down. Often this will solve the problem right away, but sometimes the neighbor may become angry. If your neighbor becomes angry with you, there are some more steps you can take. You might write a letter to the neighborhood committee. Make sure you write down the source of the noise and the time in the letter. They will review the situation and decide whether your neighbor is out of line. Some noise is considered to be _ , even if it bothers you. So you may prepare a good pair of earplugs . Even if your neighbor makes too much noise, you don't have to live your life in discomfort. It's always a good idea to be friendly with your neighbors. You may clean the rubbish in front of his door. He's sure to appreciate behavior like this and be more open to your suggestions about noise level.	['To tell the neighbor how bad his behavior is']
What's the passage mainly about?	"Teens who become addicted to their cellphones may be placing their health at risk by harming their ability to sleep well,a new Swedish study suggests. ""The message is that teenagers who use their cellphones excessively are much more stressed, much more restless, much more tired, and have a great tendency to develop sleep deprivation as a result of their calling habits, "" said the study author Dr. Gaby Bader. He focused on the experiences of 21 healthy Swedish boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 20. The teens kept what the authors described as ""regular working/studying hours"" and were not previously diagnosed with any particular sleep irregularity. He observed that the above-15 call group kept more irregular sleeping hours than the lower-use group,had more difficulty falling asleep,more difficulty waking up,and experienced more sleep disruptions . Bader said that among young people,a ly recent technological invention like the cellphone has quickly become existed nearly everywhere,giving rise to considerable pressure to keep in touch. And this pressure can develop into an addiction,with serious negative results for teenager health. ""We see more and more people--especially the young generation-- who grew up with these kinds of items and gadgets in their hands,"" Bader said. ""And they become dependent on the technology. So,we have to teach young people to be structured. To know when to have the cellphone on,and when to switch it off. To avoid becoming the slave of technology,instead of the master. "" Dr. Mary Carskadon expressed little surprise with the finding. "" Interpersonal contact is one of the things that's best at keeping us awake,"" she observed. ""And so,a young person receiving cellphone texts or phone calls is going to have more deep disturbances. And they are going to be tired and restless,and probably,as a result,going to use more stimulants .And judgment is not always the best in our teenage years. So, that's where I think parental attention to this issue may be useful. """	"[""Too much phone time has a bad effect on teens' sleep.""]"

The story is about _ .	The Amber Room belongs to the eight wonders of the world. It was given the name because almost several tons of amber were used to make it. First it was designed for the palace of FrederickI. Then Frederick William I, the next king of Prussia, sent it to Peter the Great as a gift of friendship from Prussian people. Later, CatherineII had the Amber Room moved to a palace outside St. Petersburg where she spent her summers and she told her artists to add more details to its design. Unfortunately, during the Second World War, the Nazi German was at war with Russia. In September 1941, the Nazis secretly stole the Amber Room and sent boxes of the Amber Room on a train for Konigsberg. After that what really happened to the Amber Room remains a mystery.

Children are unwilling to wear headgear because they think _ .	"A number of scientific studies have suggested that repeatedly heading a football could increase the risk of developing dementia in later life. In 2002, former England international footballer Jeff Astle died aged 59. A coroner said that Astle died from a brain disease likely to have been caused by ""repeated small damages to the brain"" related to heading a heavy leather football. Dr. Scott Delaney, research director of emergency medicine at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada, has also researched soccer-related head injury and agrees that head-to-head or elbow-to-head blows are the real risk. In 2007, Delaney carried out a study on footballers aged between 12 and 17 that showed they were half as likely to be concussed wearing headgear than without. He said youngsters have a higher risk of head injury than adults because their heads are thinner and less able to absorb shock. To make matters worse, their neck muscles aren't as well developed and they often lack the correct heading technique that can help throw away the force of the ball. Delaney recommends that children wear headgear when playing football and says his two eldest children wear head protection playing the sport. But he admits that children can be unwilling to be the first to wear head protection--especially when their football heroes play without it. While headgear can protect footballers from being concussed during a match, no one knows the long-term effects of repeated ""sub-concussive"" blows to the head. Delaney says that while there is indirect evidence that a career in soccer can lead to dementia, no one has yet found a sure link between the two. He says proving a link would mean monitoring hundreds of footballers for three or four decades--and that would take a lot of funding."	['they should follow their idols']

All of the following can influence how much sunlight falls on plants EXCEPT _ .	"Not all vegetables need lots of sunshine. Mark Hoffman and his wife own a bed-and-breakfast guesthouse in rural Kempton, Illinois. They often serve their guests fresh products from the garden. The Hoffmans have been growing food and flowers for twenty-five years. For almost ten of those years, Mr. Hoffman has been experimenting and working with shade plantings. He says, ""The bottom line here is that most plants will produce more in full sun. But if you do not have full sun, there are other choices."" For example, he grows tomatoes near oak trees. Oak trees can produce a lot of shade. But Mr. Hoffman says his tomato plants grow as long as they get five hours' direct sunshine a day, especially morning sun. Not only does this go against the traditional advice that tomatoes need six, eight, even twelve hours' full sun a day. It also shows how plants and tree roots can share nutrients and water. Mr. Hoffman says plants with wider leaves seem to do better in shady environments. He also found that his potatoes did better partly in shade than in full sun. Moving them out of the sun helped control an insect problem. Mr. Hoffman does not use pesticide . Instead, he planted the potatoes in the shade, especially on the east side of the tree. The potatoes get morning sun, but they are shaded during the hottest part of the day. Some insects dislike shade, and the hottest part day is when they do the worst of their damage. Time of day, sun intensity , shadows from trees, walls and buildings all influence how much sunlight falls on plants. And people interested in shade planting should also remember something else. The term ""shade"" can describe different amounts of darkness. It can even mean different things in different parts of the world."	['changes of the season']
Which of the following is suitable to describe Rebecca's impression of Alec?	"A tall figure appeared from the dark door of the tent. It was a smoking young man about twenty three or four. He had an almost black face, though smooth. His moustache was black with curled points. There was an unusual force in his face, and in his daring rolling eyes. cef Rebecca still stood hesitating like a swimmer about to make his dive, hardly knowing whether to return or move forward. ""Hi, my beauty, what can I do for you?"" said he, approaching. Realizing that she was quite at a loss, the man spoke in a gentle voice, ""Never mind. I am Mr. Thackeray. Have you come to see me or my mother?"" This scene differed greatly from what Rebecca had expected. She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face. She told herself to be calm and answered ""I came to see your mother, sir."" ""I am afraid you cannot see her-she is ill in bed,"" replied the representative of the house; for this was Mr. Alee Thackeray, the only son of the noble family. ""What is the business you wish to see her about?"" ""It isn't business-it is-I can hardly say what!"" ""Pleasure?"" ""Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem..."" Rebecca's sense of a certain ridicule(,) was now so obvious and strong that, despite her general discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile, much to the attraction of the young man. ""It is so foolish"", she murmured. ""I fear I can't tell you!"" ""Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,"" said he kindly. ""Mother told me to come,"" Rebecca continued; ""and, indeed, I was in the mind to do so myself. But I did not expect it would turn out like this. I came...sir, I came to tell you that we are of the same family as you."" ""Ho Ho! Poor relations?"" ""Yes."" ""Rossetti?"" ""No. Thackeray."" ""Ay, ay; I mean Thackeray."" ""Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs that we are Thackeray. The local scholars hold the view that we are, and...and we have an old seal and a silver spoon marked with the same castle as yours. So mother said we ought to make ourselves known to you, as we've lost our horse by a bad accident. We can hardly make a living."" ""It's very kind of your mother, I'm sure."" Alec looked at Rebecca as he spoke, in a way that made her uneasy. ""And so, my pretty girl, you've come on a friendly visit to us, as relations?"" ""I suppose I have,"" looking less confident and uncomfortable again. ""Well, there's no harm in it. I mean it doesn't hurt to come and make yourself known to me. Where do you live?

The backpacker placed some money in the woman's cup rather ostentatiously because _ .	"I always experienced guilt when I passed by without giving a coin or two to a beggar. My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the crowds drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, ""I hope that helps a bit."" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did. I placed some money in the woman's cup and continued my travels, light-hearted after witnessing such an act of caring."	['he wanted the tourist group to follow him']
The writer called his father when he was ill _ .	I don't like talking openly about my feelings. That's probably why I am writing this, because it seems an easier way of telling you how thankful I am to you. When I first got ill two years ago and had to be taken to hospital, you were the first person I called to tell, maybe because I knew Mum wasn't going to answer her phone, but probably because you are the first person I call in an emergency. As one illness turned into another and I was stuck in hospital for weeks, feeling sorry for myself, you were still at my beside trying to talk to me to cheer me up. The illness hit my kidney and we then realized that I was going to need a transport sooner or later. You put yourself forward to be tested as soon as possible and it turned out you were a perfect match. Then last year, in March, we both went down for the operation. I woke a few hours afterwards and felt better. It wasn't until the following day that we got to see each other again. We hugged silently and asked one another how we were. But I never said the words I should have--- thank you. To this day, I still haven't said those words to you for my kidney. In the month after the operation, when we were both at home recovering, I made you lunch, went for walks with you. It's my way of saying that I care for you a great deal and that I am truly thankful for what you did for me. I want you to know that my silence towards you and the times you tried to talk to me and got nothing weren't because of you. Maybe one day when you will read this, I hope you know that in my own silent way, I am for ever thankful.	['because he could get help from his father at once']
. What can we learn from the text?	Why are people interested in eating raw foods or whole foods? One reason is that eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid accumulation in your body. Raw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked and refined foods. When we cook foods, we destroy the natural enzymes that are part of the food in its raw form. These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food. When we consume food without these natural enzymes, our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. In both instances, the result is obesity. When too many nutrients are absorbed at once, the body grows fat. Improperly digested food moves slowly through the digestive tract, where it becomes increasingly acidic . To protect its vital organs from this acidic waste, the body changes the acid into fat and stores it safely away from the organs. Processed foods contain chemical elements, which might confuse the appetite mechanism that tells us when we've had enough to eat; as a result, people often overeat . Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle. The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat, or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste, which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells. The body's metabolism becomes inactive, and then result is weight gain and obesity. The accumulation of acid in the digestive tract makes digestion increasingly inefficient. When that happens, even healthy foods can become acidic and the food allergies will become more common. To stop this vicious circle in its tracks, people need to consume food and supplements that will neutralize (...)the acid already accumulated in body. Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help. it's also important to restore your enzyme balance. You need to identify and avoid the foods that cause acid accumulation and consume the foods that increase enzyme production. If you truly want to change and help your body heal itself , you need to take an active approach..	['Eating the right types of raw and whole foods does good to our body']
What can we know about the controlled study?	"Ask anyone what is the most difficult part of changing their lifestyle habits and they are most likely to say, ""Staying motivated."" But a 36-year-old professor from Carnegie Mellon University claims it may have the answer in the form of robot weight loss coach that dishes out daily health advice and encouragement. Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots. The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them. Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character. In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log. ""While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,"" he said. The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen. Autom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around $500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed."

The author thinks that flattery can do good to those who _ .	"An ""apple polisher"" is one who gives gifts to win friendship or special treatment. It is not exactly a bribe ,but is close to it. All sorts of people are apple polishers, including politicians and people in high offices -- just about everybody. Oliver Cromwell, the great English leader, offered many gifts to win the support of George Fox and his party, but failed. There are other phrases meaning the same thing as ""apple-polishing"" -- ""soft-soaping"" or ""butter-up"". A gift is just one way to ""soft-soap"" somebody, or to ""butter him up"". Another that is just as effective is flattery, giving someone high praise -- telling him how good he looks, or how well he speaks, or how talented and wise he is. Endless are the ways of flattery. Who does not love or hear it ? Only an unusual man can resist the thrill of being told how wonderful he is. In truth, flattery is good medicine for most of us, who gets so little of it. We need it to be more sure of ourselves. It cannot hurt unless we get carried away by it. But we just lap it up for its food value and nourishment, as a cat laps up milk, then we can still remain true to ourselves. Sometimes, however, flattery will get you nothing from one who has had too much of it. A good example is the famous 12th century legend of King Canute of Denmark and England. The king got tired of listening to the endless sickening flattery of his courtiers .They overpraised him to the skies, as a man of limitless power. He decided to teach them a lesson. He took them to the seashore and sat down. Then he ordered the waves to stop coming in. The tide was too busy to listen to him. The king was satisfied. This might show his followers how weak his power was and how empty their flattery."	['lack confidence']

An accident took the life of the child only a short time later. It is told that the father kept that little gold box by his bed for all the year of his life.

The best title of the text would be _ .	Do you start your work by making a list of all you have to complete, from walking the dog and washing the clothes, to phoning a or checking your emails? Do you always take a list with you to the supermarket? Do you write down all the steps you need to see a big project through? If you're a natural list maker you can consider this habit as a good thing to do. Here are some reasons: Gives your memory a kick: Even if you pride yourself on remembering all you need to complete, it's only human to forget every once in a while. A to-do list is a handy reminder. Helps you stay in the moment: It sounds surprising, but true. Trying to mentally keep track of the things weighing on your mind can make it tougher to concentrate on the activity at hand. _ : Instead of carrying around a nagging nervousness that you've forgotten to take care of a chore, keeping an up-to-date list can help relieve that kind of stress. Helps planning: Most of us are likely to put off until tomorrow what we can do today, but keeping a list helps to keep this natural impulse at bay. Thinking about what has to be done in advance is a good way to prevent us from falling behind schedule. Prioritizes : Seeing everything we want to take care of allows us to prioritize and give the most time to the more important tasks. On the other hand, not having a to-do list makes it possible for us to spend too much time on unimportant items. Boosts happiness: You will feel very happy each time you check off a task you have completed on your list. Studies show that reaching your goal actually releases feel-good chemical in your brain that boosts happiness.	['Why You Should Keep a To-Do List']
The best way for the newcomers to overcome culture shock is _ .	"""You're going to the United States to live? How wonderful! You're really lucky!"" Does this sound familiar? Perhaps your family and friends said similar things to you when you left home. But does it seem true all the time? Is your life in this new country always wonderful and exciting? A great many facts show that it's not easy for newcomers to adjust to life in a new culture. They have to experience culture shock. What causes culture shock? Maybe the weather is unpleasant. Perhaps the customs are different. Perhaps the public service systems such as the telephone, post office, or transportation are difficult to figure out and you make mistakes. The simplest things seem difficult. The language may be difficult. The food may seem strange to you. If you don't look similar to the natives, you may feel strange. You may feel as if everyone is watching you. In fact, you are always watching yourself. Everyone experiences culture shock in some form or another. But culture shock comes as a surprise to most people. A lot of the time, the people with the worst culture shock are the people who never had any difficulties in their own countries. They were active and successful in their community. They had hobbies or pastimes which they enjoyed. When they come to a new country, they do not have the same positions or hobbies as they already had in their countries. They find themselves without a role, almost without an identity. They have to build a new self-image. Culture shock produces a feeling of disorientation , which may be homesickness, imagined illness, or even paranoia . When people feel the disorientation of culture shock, they sometimes feel like staying inside all the time. They want to protect themselves from the unfamiliar environment. They want to create an escape within their room to give themselves a sense of security. This escape does solve the problem of culture shock for the short term, but it does nothing to familiarize the person more with the culture. Familiarity and experience are the long-term ways to settle the problem of culture shock."	['to adapt themselves to the new environment']

According to Kaplan's idea, _ .	"Can feeling of nostalgia be good for you? or is it unhealthy to have a strong love for the past? For years, medical experts have studied nostalgia and the reasons for it. Many experts warn that too much nostalgia is harmful. They say linger in the past shows that a person is unhappy with his present life. These feelings keep the person from living his life to its fullest. Dr. Louise Kaplan has written several books about nostalgia. She says these feelings often begin when a young person is between 13 and 19 years old. ""This is the time when you must face the loss of your childhood, "" Kaplan says. ""You see your new life is easily destroyed. But you think romantically about a golden past. You remember your childhood as a time when life was perfect."" These feelings continue as a person gets older, Kaplan adds. She says many grown persons have a hard time keeping up with changes in the modem world, so they think back to their younger years. At that time the world seemed simple and more harmless. Kaplan says these feelings are not always actually existing. The good old days weren't always good. However, she says nostalgia can be helpful, if used properly. ""Feelings of nostalgia can cause you to remember a time when you had high hopes and dreams, "" Kaplan says. ""It might give you the strong wish to catch those dreams today, in your present life."" She adds that nostalgia can prevent you from ""cutting yourself off from your aim."" ""At its best, "" Kaplan says, ""nostalgia has the ideas for the future."""	['nostalgia can be helpful']
What is Mark Bauerlein ' s attitude to texting?	"I have always known my kids use digital communications equipment a lot. But my cellphone bill last month really grabbed my attention. My son had come up to nearly 2,000 incoming text messages, and had sent nearly as many. Of course, he was out of school for the summer and communicating more with friends from a distance. Nevertheless, he found time to keep a summer job and complete a college course in between all that typing with thumb. I was even more surprised to learn that my son is normal. ""Teenagers with cellphones each send and receive 2,272 text messages a month on average, "" Nielsen Mobile said. Some experts regret that all that keyboard jabber is making our kids stupid, unable to read non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, gestures, posture and other silent signals of mood and attitude. Unlike phones, text messaging doesn't even allow transmission of tone of voice or pauses, says Mark Bauerlein, author called The Dumbest Generation: How the Digital Age Stupefies Young Americans and Jeopardizes Our Future. Beyond that, though, I'm not sure I see as much harm as critics of this trend. I' ve posted before on how I initially tried to control my kids' texting. But over time, I have seen my son suffer no apparent ill effects, and he gains a big benefit, continuing contact with others. I don't think texting make kids stupid. It may make them annoying, when they try to text and talk to you at the same time. And it may make them _ when buzzing text message interrupt efforts to noodle out a math problem or finish reading for school. But I don't see texting harming teens' ability to communicate. My son is as accustomed to nonverbal cues as any older members of our family. I have found him more engaged and easier to communicate with from a great distance. because he is constantly available by means of text message and responds with faithfulness and speed."

There is no pollution in Iceland mainly because _ .	"To American visitors, Iceland is a very interesting country, partly because it is different in so many ways from what he or she is used to seeing at home. There are quite a few things that are not done, or that do not exist on the island - quite a few ""No's"". There is no pollution, for instance. No dogs are permitted in Reykjavik, the capital. There is no television on Thursdays or during the entire month of July, and only three hours of black-and-white TV the rest of the time. There is no hard liquor on Wednesdays and no beer at any time. There are no handguns; only one jail of thirty-five cells in the entire land - an admirable figure, even for a small country of 313,376 people. There is no army, air force or navy. There is no tipping for anything. There are no large stores open on Saturdays or Sundays. Since Iceland is situated just under the Arctic Circle, there is no darkness in summer and do daylight in winter. But thanks to Gulf Stream, the climate is rather mild, with temperatures ranging from 34 degrees Fahrenheit to 52 degrees in July. The rules on television, liquor, and guns are the result of governmental decision. But the absence of pollution is due in great part to the fact that Iceland gets its power from the enormous geyser and the thousands of hot springs that come out of the ground. They provide all the energy needed by the country. In fact, Iceland uses only 3 percent of all its available power. Iceland has been described as a democratic independent country where more fish are caught and more books published per person than anywhere else in the world. The Icelanders have always felt a particular love for literature. They composed their first works in the ninth and tenth centuries AD. These works were poems and tales about the kings, heroes, and heroines of Iceland and Norway. At first the stories were memorized and passed from generation to generation. The Icelanders have never stopped writing ever since. ""Rather shoeless than bookless,"" they proudly say."	['the Icelanders use hot water from the ground below as their energy']

What would happen if women's wages were raised?	Why do women earn less than men? Women earn less than men. For example, in 1988 the hourly wages of women in the U.S. were 16% less than those of men. The gap between male and female incomes varies with age. The gap between the labor incomes of young women and young men is much smaller than that between middle-aged women and men. It is also clear that jobs in which women are concentrated pay less. The larger the number of workers in an industry who are women, the lower the average wages. Why do women earn less than men? Are the differences explained by the fact that women are looked down upon? If so, the government has to intervene, to force the employers to pay equal wages to equal jobs. however, there is no agreement among economists about the causes of the gap. One view argues that women on the average have chosen low-paying jobs in which workers enjoy the freedom of entering and leaving the labor force, which reduces their years of experience relative to men. Other people say the gap can also be explained by the difference in educational background which is shown in the difference in the marginal product between men and women. Much of the gap, however, has not been fully explained. It might be the result of some bias against women. It is this part that has produced calls for government action. What would happen if the government did intervene to increase the wages paid to women? One possibility is that incomes for women as a group might actually decline. An increase in wage decreases the quantity of labor input demanded, resulting in decreased employment as the rate of hiring new workers declines. The result will be a surplus of labor. Those who can find jobs might be better off while those who had jobs might find themselves out of work.	['The unemployment rate would go up.']

"The main idea of this passage is that ""Just in case"" _ ."	"If ""I love you"" are the three nicest words in the English language, then ""just in case"" must be the three most annoying. They are often followed by ""you never know..."" suggesting a whole bundle of horrors if you don't go along with the ""just in case"" idea. The first ""just in case"" you heard was probably from your mother. Do you remember ""Always make sure your underwear is clean. Just in case""? You'd ask ""In case of what?"" and she'd say, ""You never know..."" If you kept asking she would finally say the ominous words. ""You could be in an accident."" Through most of you school years, besides books, pens, etc... you carried around a heavy sweater, sunscreen, and a rain coat, just in case it got cold, or hot, or it rained. Thanks to Mom, ""just in case"" ruled your life. It was the same with Halloween candy. ""Don't eat in until Mom or Dad can check it out, just in case."" ""In case of what?"" you'd say. ""You never know."" ""Know what?"" And then it came - _ . which ensured you would end up letting Mom and Dad eat all your candy. Simply because they loved you so much and wanted to protect you from harm. ""There could be poison in it."" As we get older the habit has become so deep-rooted that we force it on ourselves. We leave for the airport to catch our Flight half an hour before the aircraft leave its previous location, just in case the traffic is bad. ""Just in case"".

Why are scientists designing silicon computer chips acting like human organs?	Testing new drugs for safety and effectiveness is a costly process in the United States. It also can take:lot of time. Some scientists are now designing silicon computer chips that act like human organs. The scientists think they have found a way to make the process faster and more economical. The silicon computer chips are smaller than a child's hand. Each one has living cells that act and react like a human organ. The chips are being created as part of a program to test the safety of drug compounds. It is called the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening Program. It is a project of the US National Center for Advancing Tmnslational Sciences, or NCATS. Danilo Tagle is the center's Associate Director. He says a three-dimensional computer chip can be designed to act like a human lung. Some computer chips contain very small models of the human digestive system. They copy the real function or duties of the human stomach and intestine , moving when breaking down food. Drugs are added to the tiny organs for testing through instruments known as micro-tubes. Experiments with the tissue chips have produced more detailed information than tests using animal or cell models. NCATS just announced$17 million in grants to develop an entire human organ system over the next three years.	['To make testing new drugs faster and cheaper.']
When you find some new words in reading, you shouldn't _	In learning a foreign language, one should first pay attention to speaking. It is the groundwork of reading and writing. You'd better try your best to speak. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. But be careful not to let them keep you from improving the language. While you are doing this, a good exercise is to write - keep a diary, write notes, letters or articles, then if you can, ask someone to go through what you have written and tell you where is wrong . Many mistakes in your speaking will be easily found when you write. Through correcting the mistakes, you can do better in learning a language. If you are slow in speaking, don't worry. One of the helpful ways is by reading, either aloud or to yourself. The important thing is to choose something interesting to read. It can't be too difficult for you. When you are reading in this way, don't stop to look up the words if you can guess their meanings or if they have nothing important to do with the sentence. You can do that some other time .

The doctor compares your height and weight in order to _ .	Your weight has been important since the moment you were born. Maybe you even know what your birth weight was. Most newborns weigh between 6 and 9 pounds, but some may weigh more and some less. But very quickly, a baby gains weight and everyone is glad about that because it means the child is growing bigger and stronger. As you get older, your weight is still important. It's something your parents and doctor will probably keep an eye on. When you go for a checkup, the doctor often will record your height and weight and compare it with what it was the last time you came in. The doctor wants to check whether you have a healthy weight because weighing too much or too little can be a problem. But these days, being overweight is more common than being underweight. In the last 30 years, a growing number of kids and teenagers have developed weight problems. Today, 1 out of 3 kids and teens between the ages of 2 and 19 are overweight. Many grown-ups understand what it's like to have weight problems, since 2 out of every 3 adults are overweight..wfsqzkss. For kids and adults, weighing too much can lead to illnesses and health problems. And a kid who is overweight might be made jokes on or find it hard to keep up with friends on the playground. When people talk about being overweight, they mean that someone has more body fat than is healthy. Everyone has some body fat, but extra fat can influence someone's health and ability to walk, run, and get around, as well as how the person looks and his or her self-respect.

In his early life, what was Qi Baishi famous for?	"Qi Baishi (1863~1957) is one of the best-known contemporary Chinese artists. His life shows he achieved success by combining talent with hard work. He was born in a peasant family. At 11 he was sent to learn carpentry . Through his work he got to know some local scholars. One of them, Hu Shenyuan, offered to teach his painting and poetry. During this period he earned his living by painting portraits and selling his works. Gradually he developed a reputation as an artist as well as a carpenter. In those years he devoted himself to poetry, calligraphy , and seal-carving. Although he admitted he was a versatile artist, his own criteria of his successes placed poetry first, seal-carving second, calligraphy third, and painting last. From 1902 to 1916, Qi toured the country five times, and he left his footmarks in many cities, such as Beijing and Hongkong. The trips broadened his vision and changed his style. In 1917 he settled down in Beijing, where he met many artists and scholars, and made friends with Chen Shizeng. Chen advised him not to _ early masters and to form his own style. Through long years of practice, Qi Baishi evolved a distinctive personal style. The subjects of his painting were wide and various, and the flowers, birds, fish, prawns , and insects he painted are most admired by his public. To improve his technique of painting prawns, he raised some at home and frequently observed their movements. He wrote in his diary about how he had changed his method of painting prawns: ""At first my prawns owned a reasonable similarity, then they became even more realistic, and finally light and dark color1s became properly contrasted. These are the three changes."" Qi Baishi was able to portray the same object in either the xieyior thegongbistyle. When he painted a dragonfly in a detailed manner, he even drew the veins in its wings. When he adopted a , free style, he used only a few dry, expressive strokes to form it. What is fascinating about his work is that in some pictures both methods are used."	['Poetry']
According to the author, the model of Pepsi _ .	Culture is one of the most challenging elements of the international marketplace. This system of learned behavior patterns characteristic of the members of a given society is constantly shaped by a set of dynamic variables : language, religion, values and attitudes, manners and customs, aesthetics, technology, education, and social institutions. To deal with this system, an international manager needs both factual and interpretive knowledge of culture. To some extent, the factual knowledge can be learned; its interpretation comes only through experience. The most complicated problems in dealing with the cultural environment lie in the fact that one cannot learn culture--one has to live it. Two schools of thought exist in the business world on how to deal with cultural differences. One is that business is business the world around, following the model of Pepsi and McDonald's. In some cases, globalization is a fact of life; however, cultural differences are still far from disappearing. The other school suggests that companies must adjust business approaches to individual cultures. Setting up policies and procedures in each country has been compared to an organ transplant; the critical question centers around acceptance or rejection. The major challenge to the international manager is to make sure that rejection is not a result of cultural myopia or even blindness. Fortuneexamined the international performance of a dozen large companies that earn 20 percent or more of their revenue overseas. The internationally successful companies all share an important quality: patience. They have not rushed into situations but rather built their operations carefully by following the most basic business principles. These principles are to know your rivals, know your audience, and know your customer.	"[""is different from the model of McDonald's .""]"
What can we learn about the French from the passage?	"Do you have any friends from other countries? Do you know what they are like? The Germans are very quiet and they don't get excited easily.

Why did the writer think it was her sister who had taken her homework?	"One Tuesday, we got up, had breakfast and got ready for school. We picked up our school bags and went to school. I opened my school bag to get my homework after I went into the classroom and sat down. My school homework needed to be handed in. But it was not there! I remembered I had put it in my school bag. I thought back to Monday afternoon. I finished my school homework, put it in my school bag, and went out to play softball with the neighbor kids. My sister Sara was not out playing as usual. She read a book inside the house. She must have taken my homework while I was playing softball outside as no kids came inside our house on Monday. After school I ran to the place where my sister and I usually meet. There was Sara. She didn't seem to be laughing at me. She is good at giving false information. ""Sara, what have you done with my homework?"" I asked. She said she hadn't seen it! ""What should I do?"" I thought. I waited for a chance to talk to Mom. In Mom ' s room, I cried and shouted: I couldn't help shaking. I told her about my missing school homework. Hearing this, Mom left the room, went into the kitchen hurriedly and started looking in the trash. She pulled my school homework out of the trash! Mom said, ""I' m sorry, Teri. I saw that your school bag was too heavy, so I cleaned it out for you. Your homework didn't look any different from the waste paper which I threw away."" I realized that I had misunderstood my sister. I apologized to her. And I learnt a good lesson from this experience."	['Because her sister was in the house while she was out.']

When choosing words for their products,advertisers should consider _ .	"Language has a powerful influence over people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance. The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle way. It is important to understand the connotation of a word. ""Armchair"",for example,suggests comfort,whereas ""chair"" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways. Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language. The language of advertising always emphasizes why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent may say ""It gets clothes whiter"",but whiter than what?"

Whats the current number of Alzheimers patients?	Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people around the world. American researchers say the disease will affect more than one hundred million people worldwide by the year twenty fifty. That would be four times the current number. Researchers and doctors have been studying Alzheimer's patients for a century. Yet the cause and the cure for the mental sickness are still unknown. However, some researchers have made important steps towards understanding it. Several early signs of the disease involve memory and thought processes. At first, patients have trouble remembering little things. Later, they have trouble remembering more important things, such as the names of their children. There are also some physical tests that might show who is at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The tests look for proteins in brain and spinal cord fluid. The proteins appear to be found only in people with the disease. The protein tests correctly identify the presence of the disease in about ninety percent of patients. Now, a much simpler physical test to predict Alzheimer's risk has been developed. Researchers found that trouble with the sense of smell can be one of the first signs of Alzheimer's. Using this information, they developed a test in which people were asked to identify twelve familiar smells. These smells included cinnamon, black pepper, chocolate, paint thinner, and smoke. The study continued for five years. During this period, the same people were asked to take several tests measuring their memory and thought abilities. Fifty percent of those who could not identify at least four of the smells in the first test had trouble with their memory and thinking in the next five years. Another study has shown a possible way to reduce a person's chances of developing Alzheimer's disease in old age. Researchers in Chicago found that people who use their brains more often are less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Those who read a newspaper, or play chess or word games are about three times less likely to develop the condition. Researchers say they still do not know what causes Alzheimer's disease. But they say these findings might help prevent the disease in the future.	['25 million']

It made her feel better, knowing that she might be making somebody's day through just a few short, sweet words. It gave her something to focus on. And so, the website The World Needs More Love Letters was born. The World Needs More Love Letters is all about writing letters--not emails, but proper, handwritten letters. Not traditional love letters, written to a real beloved, but surprise letters for strangers. They don't necessarily say ""I love you"", but they are full of kindness--telling people they are remarkable and special and all-around amazing. Brencher's initiative has now exploded. She has personally written hundreds of letters. Last year, she did a TED talk, in which she talks about a woman whose husband, a soldier, comes back home from Afghanistan and they struggle to reconnect: ""So she leaves love letters all over the house as a way to say: 'Come back to me. Find me when you can.'"" And then comes another story of a man threatening to kill himself on his Facebook page, only to now be in the land of the living, with many love letters under his pillow. The World Needs More Love Letters Project works on the idea that _ "". It's about sharing positive energy, restoring confidence and happiness. There are now more than 10,000 people from all over the world joining in to write letters to the lonely and depressed, to basically tell them that everything will be okay."

Which of the following is TRUE?	"Residents along Australia's east coast awoke in the morning to an orange sky as winds swept millions of tons of red dust from the country's inland and dumped it on Sydney. Tanya Ferguson,living in Sydney,saw that the room was completely orange.She thought there was a bush fire.But when she went outside,the entire city was covered in a film of orange dust. ""It was like being in the outback ,but it was right here in the city,""she said On that day,a big dust storm swept through Sydney.It covered the city in orange dust for about eight hours,making landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Harbor Bridge invisible. The storm affected the transportation system.Flights were delayed.Roads were busy as drivers struggled in the difficult conditions.Children and the elderly were told to stay indoors until the dust had cleared.Later strong winds blew it out to the sea and up the coast. No one was hurt in the storm,though health officials answered hundreds of calls from people with breathing difficulties.Emergency services responded to hundreds of calls about tree branches brought down by strong winds. Dust storms are common in the Australian outback,where the land is arid .But the storms rarely reach the coastal regions. Officials said it was the worst dust storm of the past 70 years.Air pollution levels were 15,500 micrograms of pollutants per cubic meter. ""On a clear day the pollutants are around 10--20 micrograms per cubic meter,""said Chris Eiser of the NSW department of the environment. Experts said that dry conditions in the outback and strong winds caused the sandstorm. ""Ten very dry years over inland southern Australia and very strong winds have combined to produce the storm,""said Nigel Tapper,an environmental scientist at Monash University, Australia."

According to the passage, we can know that dealing with peer pressure is _	"It is reasonable to say that every teenager can be affected by peer pressure at some point. Every day, in any high school, peer pressure has a major influence over the behavior of teenagers. It can be as subtle as being persuaded to be late for class or as extreme as a dangerous drug. Whether subtle or extreme, peer pressure can have damaging, sometimes life changing, and even serious results. ""Teens don't often consider the long-term results that some behavior can cause,"" said Terri Price, a researcher. ""Peer pressure can be very difficult to handle for many teens because of their fears of not fitting in"". Peer pressure has always been part of teen life, but teens experience _ differently than their former generations did in the past. Sources of peer pressure have increased because of the Internet and other electronic communications. Recognizing peer pressure can be as simple as noticing that you have been asked to do something that you are not comfortable with. ""Listen to your instinct , which is a sign for whether something is right or wrong. If it feels wrong, then most likely it is. ""says Price. Teens are in a time of life when they are still discovering who they are. Many teens are influenced by peer pressure because of their insecurities . This can make them helpless especially when their self-control is weak or they lack healthy support, causing them to take risky behavior or turn to unhealthy support. Dealing with peer pressure is a topic of concern for teens. People can say, ""Just say no,"" but the truth is that the statement is easier said than done."	['hard']

While translating, the writer repeated the names of the characters to _ .	"For years I have been asked by several people how and why I came to translate a novel by Virginia Woolf in 1945. I graduated from the University of Ankara in 1941 and my four teachers, including Orphan Burian, are members of the Translation Bureau who prepared a list of works to be translated into Turkish and set themselves to translating some of these, besides shouldering the heavy work of correcting or editing the translations submitted to the Bureau. Orphan Burian, now mostly known for his translations of Shakespeare, had started to translate To the Lighthouse for the Translation Bureau, but at the same time he wanted to do something from Shakespeare. So he transferred it to me. For me, To the Lighthouse was love at first sight or rather at first reading. To translate a book, I first read it from the beginning to the end. Then I started writing each sentence by hand. When I finished the whole book I read my translation from the beginning to the end, checking it with the original, and making corrections. Then I typed it, and read the typed copy, making changes again. All in all that added up to five readings. I started translating the novel in 1943 and submitted it to the Bureau in 1944. It was published in 1945 under the general title of ""New English Literature"" in the series called ""Translations from World Literature"" known as the ""Classical Series"". So, the first book by Virginia Woolf in Turkish appeared in 1945, and it was To the Lighthouse. This was eighteen years after its publication in England in 1927. To me the book itself was pure poetry; I read it as if in a dream. Not trying to dive very deeply into it, I sort of swam on it or over it. Now, years later, _ . Even after so many years, in each reading I become conscious of new layers of which I haven't been aware before. It keeps pace with my experiences in life as years go by, and each reading is a new reading for me. In 1982 and again in 1989 I revised it for two new editions and I again did it sentence by sentence checking it with the original. In those years I had thought it was necessary to revise my translations every ten years, but now I think I must do it every three or four years. In a country like Turkey, where we work very hard to clear our language from old and new foreign words, we should try to be up to date as to the words we are using, and of the same importance are the studies being made on the methods or techniques of translation, and new approaches in translation. While translating, I usually have both the writer and the reader in mind. The novels she wrote after 1920 were especially new for most of the readers. She usually uses very short sentences, followed by rather long ones. I remember sentences of more than ten lines which weren't easy for me to translate as they were. And in Turkish our having only one word, the word ""O"", for ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" in English, made me repeat the names of the characters more often than Woolf did. And I changed some long indirect sentences in the original into direct sentences in my translation, thinking it would make an easier reading in Turkish. When translating, I make use of all kinds of dictionaries. A difficult English word for me is the word ""vision"". In To the Lighthouse, the artist Lily Briscoe is trying to finish the picture she has been drawing for some time and the novel ends with the following sentences: ""Yes, she thought, laying down her brush extremely tired, I've had my vision."" And I'm still thinking about how to translate this remark into Turkish."	['make her translation clearer in Turkish']
What can we learn about plastic bottles from the article?	"Bottled water has become the choice for people who are healthy and thirsty. Bottled water is all over the world. But some say the planet's health, and people's health may be suffering from it. The idea that bottled water is safer for humans may not be true. The Natural Resources Defense Council of America said, ""There is no promise that because water comes out of a bottle, it is cleaner or safer than water from the tap."" Another New York City-based action group added that some bottled water is ""really just tap water in a bottle--sometimes more clean, sometimes not."" It is not proven that bottled water is better than tap water. Nick Reeves from the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management said, ""The high mineral content of some bottled water makes them not good for feeding babies and young children."" Also, most bottled water doesn't have fluoride , which can make teeth stronger. Kids are drinking more bottled water and less fluoridated tap water, and some say that's behind the recent rise in bad teeth. Storing is another problem. Placed near heat, the plastic bottles can produce bad chemicals into the water. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, some 2.7 million tons of plastic are used worldwide to bottle water each year. The plastic can take between 400 and 1,000 years to break down. In terms of energy use, plastic bottles are also not cheap. One report said that if water and soft drink bottlers had used 10 percent recycled materials in their plastic bottles, they would have saved about 72 million gallons of gas. So, if you are worried about the effect of bottled water on the Earth, you can take the following steps. *Drink from your tap. Unless your government warns against this, it should be fine. *Get a container . Carry your tap water in a steel or a lined drinking container, and clean it between uses. *Keep it cool. Don't drink from a bottle that has been sitting in the sun, don't store it near chemicals, and don't reuse plastic bottles. *Choose glass containers over plastic if possible. When finished, recycle!"

From the passage we learn most children in the shelter _ .	"Growing up, I wanted to be just like my mom. She was kind. People always seemed to feel comfortable in her presence. For years, she was a volunteer in our community. I loved going to the local nursing home with her where she taught a ceramic class. On one summer day, Mama told me to get changed and meet her at the car. I had planned to spend the day at the lake with friends. Why did she have to ruin everything? I imagined the cool lake water. Irritated, I climbed into the car and slammed the door shut. We sat in silence. I was too upset to make conversation. ""Tasha, would you like to know where we are going?"" Mama asked calmly. ""No,"" I said. ""We are going to volunteer at a children's shelter today. I have been there before and I think it would benefit you,"" she explained. When we reached the shelter, Mama rang the doorbell. Moments later, we were greeted by a woman. She led us to the front room where all of the children were playing. I noticed a baby whose body was scarred with iron marks. I was told it was because she wouldn't stop crying. The majority of the children had noticeable physical scars. Others hid their emotional wounds. As I took in my surroundings, I felt a gentle tug on my shirt. I looked down to see a little girl looking up at me. ""Hi. You want to play dolls with me?"" she asked. I looked over at Mama for _ . She smiled and nodded. I turned back and said, ""Sure."" Her tiny hand reached up and held mine, as if to comfort me. My mom taught me a valuable lesson that summer. I returned to the shelter with her several times. During those visits, some of the children shared their troubled pasts with me and I learned to be grateful for what I had. Today as I strive to instill these values in my own child, I reflect back to that experience. It was a time that I will never forget."	['were once treated badly']
Jenny's accident received national attention because _ .	Last Saturday night Jenny was walking through a mall in London , texting on her phone. She wasn't watching where she was going , so she fell into a sewer and got trapped. Luckily she didn't hurt badly. She quickly climbed out and walked away. But her accident was caught on a mall camera. Then someone posted it on YouTube. The video was viewed almost 2 million times and received national attention. Jenny was angry with this, but she learned a deep lesson: Texting while walking is dangerous. This time I just fell into a sewer. Next time I didn't know what would happen. Maybe I would be knocked down by a car or something else. It was horrible. Jenny may be famous for her mistake. After that, she was laughed at by her friends and workmates. She _ what she had done. But it was too late. However, she wasn't the only one who got into trouble while texting on the phone. In 2008, more than 1000 Englishmen visited hospital for similar reasons. They were walking and texting or talking on the phone. Suddenly a wall appeared! Or a hole or something like that got in the way. There were cuts, bumps, broken bones and even worse result happened on them. So we must be careful when we are walking. Don't send messages or talk with somebody on the phone while walking. Or you may hurt yourself and become another Jenny in the future.	['her accident video on YouTube was viewed almost 2 million times']
What is the passage mainly about?	Everyone worries. But how do you deal with your worries? Whether your worries are big or small, you can take these three steps to deal with your worries: 1. Try to find out what you're worried about Sometimes, you will know what you're worried about. Other times, you might not. Try to find it out first; if you can't, you can ask for help. 2. Think of ways to make it better There is always something you can do to help you feel less worried. Sitting there worrying is no fun and it won't solve your problem. Grades at school are often top worries for kids. If you're worried about grades, ask yourself these questions: Why are grades important? What do grades mean to me? How do I get ready for class? Do I my notes even when there isn't a test? Do I have a good place to do my homework? Have I tried different ways of studying? If your worry is about a fight you had, you might write down all the things you could do: write a note to him or her, invite him or her to a basketball game, say sorry to him or her, etc. Once you have a list of things you could do, you can choose the one that gets your friend back. 3. Ask for help When you're worried, it can help to find someone to talk to. You can ask your parents, friends, or teachers for help. ,. (5)	['how to deal with our worries']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?	"Generally speaking, government regulations normally ban anything from smoking in public places to parking in certain zones. But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, _ . They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery has reached full capacity. There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. ""They have not taken local demands into consideration"", he claims. A 2003 decree by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area. Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away. The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death. ""I haven't got a job, nor am I healthy. And now they say I can't die. That's ridiculous,"" Amarido do Prado, an unemployed resident said. The city council is expected to vote on the regulation next week. ""Of course the bill is laughable, illegal, and will never be approved,"" said Gilson Soares de Campos, an assistant of the mayor. ""But can you think of a better resolution to persuade the government to change the environmental decree that is prohibiting us from building a new cemetery?"" The bill states that ""offenders will be held responsible for their acts."" However, it does not say what the punishment will be."	['No better resolution of the problems has been thought out.']
Why did Peter create eBay after graduating from university?	What is Bay? The simple answer is that it is a global trading platform where nearly anyone can trade practically anything. People can sell and buy all kinds of products and goods. Including cars, movies and DVDs, sporting goods, travel tickets, musical instruments, clothes and shoes- the list goes on and on The idea came from Peter Omidyar, who was born in Paris and moved to Washington when he was still a child, At high school, be became very interested in computer programming and after graduating from Tuft University in 1988, He worked for the next few years as a computer engineer. In his free time he started Bay as a kind of hobby, at first offering the service free by word of mouth. By 1996 there was so much traffic on the website that he had to upgrade and he began charging a fee to members. Joined by a friend, Peter Skill. and in 1998 by his capable CEO, Meg Whitman, he has never looked back. . Even in the great. com crashes of the late 1990s,abay has gone from strength to strength ,.

Students are wasting their time on insignificant homework because	"After students come home from a tiring day at school, they tend to worry a lot about their homework. Whether students are working on English or chemistry homework, they are simply working on the assignment in order to get it done, attempting to memorize the concepts for the time being and do not absorb any of the information afterward. Students are wasting their time on insignificant assignments rather than effectively using that time to achieve other accomplishments. According to www.dailymail.com, many parents are concerned that homework is being assigned rather than being used to integrate what teachers are covering in the classroom. In their eyes, if less homework is assigned, students would have much less stress and could focus more on their passions and hobbies. Homework gets in the way of participating in community service events as well as opportunities for getting a job or being a part of an extra-curricular activity. These responsibilities are important for teenagers to take on because they prepare the teenagers for the ""real world."" Without the proper exposure to work that is not school related, students will find themselves lost after they graduate. If homework were no longer given, students would have a lot more time to mature in other fields rather than being educated only on academics. In spite of the fact that teachers want students to do better on tests and absorb the material that they are teaching, homework is not accomplishing its purpose. Because school is becoming increasingly more competitive and challenging, homework is becoming a setback rather than extra practice. Its removal would benefit the well being of teenagers as well as encourage them to get out in the ""real world"" and discover themselves instead of staring at a pile of assignments."

The University of Illinois in the United States has a project called SAWBO--Scientific Animations Without Borders. It produces educational videos that can be downloaded to cell phones. The goal is to help people in developing countries improve their lives. One video shows farmers how to make a natural insecticide from neem seeds to prevent insect damage to crops. The process starts with sorting and drying the neem fruits. Then let the fruit dry in the sun for about three or four days, until they become brown. Using a mortar and stick, the fruits are slightly _ to remove the shells from the fruits without breaking the seed inside. The videos use computer animation .

Which of the following is right according to text?	If babies are given more love and feelings by their mothers, they will deal better with stress and anxiety when they grow up , research has shown. The study of eight-month-old children shows even the very earliest life experiences can influence our happiness. Lots of mother love makes children form a safe bond with their mothers , so they are able to feel safe in relationships when they grow up ,and they will have better social skills and deal with life's difficulties. The researchers, led by Dr.Joanna Maselko of Duke University in North Carolina, studied the relationships of 482 eight--month - old babies with their mothers during daily development. They studied how well the mother had dealt with her child's developmental text and how she had responded child's performance.Mental health was then assessed when the babies had grown up - at the average of 34. The more feelings and attention a mother gave to her child, the better her child would be. This kind of child had the lowest levels of anxiety, hostility and general difficulties.

Women don't take the disadvantages of high heels too seriously because of _ .	In department stores and closets all over the world, they are waiting. Their outward appearance seems rather appealing because they come in a variety of styles, patterns, materials, and color1s. But they are eventually the biggest deception that exists in the fashion industry today. What are they? They are high heels -- a woman's worst enemy (whether she knows it or not). High heel shoes are the downfall of modern society. Fashion myths have led women to believe that they are more beautiful or stylish for wearing heels, but in reality, heels succeed in creating short as well as long term troubles. Women should fight the high heel industry by refusing to use or purchase them in order to save the world from unnecessary physical and psychological suffering. For the sake of fairness, it must be noted that there is a positive side to high heels. First, heels are excellent for aerating lawns . Anyone who has ever worn heels on grass knows what I am talking about. A simple trip around the yard in a pair of those babiesgets rid of all the need to call for a lawn care specialist, and provides the perfect-sized holes to give any lawn oxygen without all those messy blocks of dirt lying around. Second, heels are quite functional for defending against oncoming enemies, who can easily be scared away by threatening them with a pair of these sharp, deadly fashion items. Regardless of such practical uses for heels, the fact remains that wearing high heels is harmful to one's physical health. Talk to any podiatrist , and you will hear that the majority of their business comes from high-heel-wearing women. High heels are known to cause problems such as misshapen feet and torn toenails. The risk of severe back problems and twisted or broken ankles is three times higher for a high heel wearer than for a flat shoe wearer. Wearing heels also creates the threat of getting a heel caught in a narrow sidewalk gap and being thrown to the ground--possibly breaking a nose, back, or neck. And of course, after wearing heels for a day, any woman knows she can look forward to a night of pain as she tries to comfort her aching feet.	['their wish to improve their appearance']

Instead of turning off the engine and taking the key with him, the driver left the bus running. And he forgot to set the brake because he was in a hurry. ""It was cold outside, and I didn't want the kids to get cold while I was using the bathroom,"" he told a police officer. The bus slowly started moving away from the gas station. As the bus picked up speed, the kids began shouting and crying. Ten-year-old Jake ran forward to the driver's seat and held the steering wheel . He pressed hard on the brake pedal and managed to stop the bus as it came nearer to a river bed. Jake turned off the engine at last. After the police arrived at the scene, they praised Jake for his great effort. ""That is one cool kid,"" said the police officer. ""I told him he would make a great police officer when he grew up."" Jake wasn't impressed with what he had done. ""Stopping the bus,"" he said, ""was easy compared to playing Grand Theft Auto III,"" his favorite action video game. The bus driver was taken to the police station. He was at first charged with ""leaving a child alone while motor is running."" The lawyer said he hoped to _ the charge because of the number of children (twenty) on the bus. ""Whatever he is charged with,"" the police officer said, ""I will see that he never drives a bus again."""	['He liked playing Grand Theft Auto III.']
.We may infer from the passage that _ .	"David Beckham had a dream: to be the first English player to appear in four World Cups.But now it appears that dream is over after a serious injury to his Achilles tendon which means he could be out of action for around six months.With this year's World Cup in South Africa only three months away, sadly Beckham looks set to miss out.The injury happened while Beckham was playing for AC Milan against AC Chievo in the Italian league.After attempting to kick the ball he fell to the ground and hobbled off the pitch before being stretchered away. It is not yet known whether he has completely severed his Achilles tendon or only torn it.The player has now flown to Finland for assessment and treatment by a knee specialist. England manager Fabio Capello fears the worst for Beckham's World Cup chances. ""We have to wait for the results of the scan but it looks like he is out of the World Cup,"" he said in a statement.""I spoke with him after the game on Sunday night to offer my support. ""David is a great professional and has worked very hard to be ready for the World Cup, so missing it will be a big blow."" Beckham's former manager at American club LA Galaxy, Alexei Lalas, echoed Capello's words of support: ""It is a horrible situation for Beckham.I know how much it meant to him to be in the World Cup and how important he was to the England team. David Beckham is now 34 and some are asking whether this serious injury could mean his whole career is over. Whatever happens, as one of football's best-known and popular players, Beckham will have no shortage of encouragement from fans around the world. Some will remember Beckham's miraculous recovery from an Achilles injury in 2006, when he was back on the pitch after only eight weeks. If he could repeat the same feat in time for the World Cup it really would be the stuff of fairytales. So, perhaps all is not lost.Optimists will _ from Alexei Lalas' words: ""You never want to write off David Beckham as he has shown us his ability to bounce back ."""

The passage suggests that _ .	"Almost all of us have been there: A sense of uneasiness strikes us when we see the battery running low on the smartphone. While today's smartphones enable us to surf the Internet, take pictures and play music, their limited, sometimes annoyingly short battery life has started to make people full of memories of early models. ""My favorite phone of all time was a silver Nokia 6310i from the early 2000s. It may be primitive by today's standards, but it could run for 17 days on a single charge,"" wrote Daily Mail columnist David Derbyshire. But scientists spend no time thinking about the past. They have built an aluminium battery which could be a cheap, fast-charging alternative to current designs. You can squeeze, and practically bend it in half without breaking the packet. It is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries, and more safe than lithium batteries - it won't catch fire ""even if you drill through it"", as Hongjie Dai of Stanford University told The Telegraph. The battery is the work of a team led by Dai. And the best part is that it has a recharge time of around one minute. However, at present, the only problem is that it produces just half the voltage of a typical lithium battery. But Dai explained they were setting about changing the voltage and energy density "". ""Our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have. I see this as a new battery in its early days,"" he told The Telegraph."

In summer, people usually wear _ clothes and do things like swimming, boating or _ .	In most parts of the world there are four seasons. They are spring, summer, fall and winter. In different seasons people wear different clothes and do different things. For example, in summer the weather is hot, so people usually wear cool clothes and do things like swimming, boating or surfing . But near the polar regions , there are only two seasons: winter and summer. In winter, nights are long. For more than two months you can't see the sun. In summer, days are long and the sun is always in the sky. There are no nights. The people living near the North Pole are called Inuit . In summer they live in tents and catch deer for food. In winter they live in small round snow houses. They can build a snow house. They make holes in the ice and catch fish and seals . They eat much meat but not many vegetables.	['cool; surfing']
How much money did Tu get from the Nobel Prize?	"STOCKHOLM---William Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Tu Youyou jointly won the 2015 Nbel Prize for medicine for their work against diseases caused by parasites , the award-giving body said on Monday. Irish-born Campbell and Japanese Omura won half of the prize for discovering a new drug, avermectin, that has helped the battle against river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing effectiveness against other parasitic diseases. The Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was awarded the other half of the prize for discovering artemisinin, a drug that has significantly reduced the mortality rates for patients suffering from malaria. ""These two discoveries have provided humankind with powerful new means to combat these debilitating diseases that affect hundreds of millions of people annually,"" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said in a statement in awarding the prize of 8 million Swedish crowns ($960,000)."" ""The consequences in terms of improved human health and reduced suffering are immeasurable. "" In an interview after the announcement, Juleen R. ZAierath, chairman of the Nobel Committee told Xinhua that Tu's ""inspiration from traditional Chinese medicine"" was important. ""But what was really important was that Tu Youyou identified the active agent in that plant extract ,"" said Zierath, adding "" there was a lot of modern chemistry, bi0-chemistry attached to this to bring forward this new drug."" Despite rapid progress in controlling malaria in the past decade, the mosquito-borne disease still kills more than half a million people a year, the vast majority of them babies and young children in the poorest parts of Africa."

What's the main purpose of the passage?	"Reading is the key to success in all school subjects. With a bit of creativity, you can help your child enjoy reading more, and encourage him to do more! Buy or borrow a lot of ""fun"" books. Choose books that are slightly below his level of reading ability. Don't forget what your child likes to do when choosing books for him. Don't comment about the books. Simply leave the books lying on the table where your child is sure to see them. Computer games are not as harmful as most parents usually think them to be. Instead, you should take advantage of your child's love of computer games to purchase those that require a lot of reading and avoid those that are simply computerized video games. Buy your child a bedside reading lamp, or a tiny book light. Tell him that from now on, he must be in bed by a specific time (say 8:30) and that he can either sleep or read. Most kids will do anything else rather than go to sleep, so there's a chance you'll create a new bedtime reading habit. Many children will read when they are sitting alone having a snack, or when they have a few minutes of unplanned free time. Put a box of books and magazines near the kitchen table so that reading material is accessible. Often, once children learn to read independently, parents stop reading to them. This change of routine causes great sadness to a child who has come to love falling asleep as you read. Even a teenager will enjoy being read to if you pick books that interest him. Select books together, and make sure they're ones you enjoy as well, so your enjoyment will come through as you read to them."	['To teach parents how to encourage children to read.']
After class, the author _ .	I have many new teachers in high school, but Lori Runkle, my English Language and Composition teacher, is my favorite teacher. Ms. Runkle enjoys getting to know more about students, so I have many chances to talk with her after class. I have always wanted to become a journalist . Since Ms. Runkle used to be a journalist back in the United States, she has introduced many helpful journalistic writing skills to me. Although she is my teacher, Ms. Runkle and I are more like friends. She often invites my classmates and me to take part in different activities outdoors. For example, I went to listen to a journalist's speech, which helped me better understand current events . Not only does Ms. Runkle talk with me outside of school, she is also a great teacher in the classroom. English Language and Composition is a really hard subject for a second language learner. We felt worried in the beginning, but Ms. Runkle really makes an effort to help us out. In class, Ms. Runkle always encourages students to question everything to keep us active. One part of class I love the most is when groups of students are requested to give speeches on events that are happening in the world. It requires a lot of deep thinking and I really learn quite a lot from it. I love Ms. Runkle very much. She not only helps me to get good scores, but also acts as a good friend and always gives me advice on life.	['talks with Ms. Runkle quite a lot']

If you lose your way in the jungle, which of the following can NOT be done?	"Jungle country is not friendly to man,but it is possible to survive there. You must have the right equipment and you must know a few important things about woodcraft . Then your chances of staying alive are very good. No one should go into the jungle without the right equipment. You need lightweight clothing, a good knife, and a compass. Fishhooks and a line,a rifle,matches in a waterproof container and a poncho are necessary too. So is a mosquito net to protect the head. In the jungle you can get hopelessly lost within five minutes after leaving known landmark . That is why you should always carry a compass. In open country during the day, you can tell which way to go by studying the sun. At night the stars are sure guides to direction. But in most places the jungle rooftop is so thick that it is impossible to see the sun or the stars. Again and again you must check your position by the compass. Keep alert . Watch the ground in front of you carefully. Stop and listen now and again. Avoid haste , and rest often. In a place that is hot and humid , the person who sets a fast pace will soon become tired. A steady and even pace is wisest in the long run. If you lose your way, don't panic. Try to decide how long it has been since you were sure of your position. Mark the spot where you are with blazes on a tree. Put them on four sides of the tree, so that you will be able to see them from any direction. Then you can beginretracing your steps(going back exactly the way you have come), knowing that you can always find the spot from which you started. Except in an emergency, never try to travel the jungle at night. Whenever possible, _ that are going in your general direction. This may cause you many extra miles of travel. But in the end it will save time and energy. Nothing is moreexhausting(extremely tiring) thanhacking(cutting) a way through unbroken jungle. Surviving in the jungle is a science. The jungle people have become perfect in this science, and you can too. Learn as much as you can about what to expect in the jungle. Make sure you have the right equipment. Then no part of the jungle will seem completely or frightening. In fact, you will be able to ""live off"" it for a long time."	['Tell which way to go by studying the sun/the stars.']
At the end of the journey, the author _ .	"I had five hours in the company of First Great Western(FGW) last weekend, on a train full of passengers, all the way from Cornwall to London. I got to know some of my fellow passengers rather well. Not through talking to them, you understand. There was the youth who was explaining to his friend exactly how he enjoyed a party with his friends last night. Opposite him was a young woman who was very excited to be going to Lanzarote for her summer holiday. And then there was the man who I took to be a car mechanic ; so detailed and technical was his conversation about a second-hand Audi. Everyone had a different, noisy ringtone, and none of the mobile phone conversations I was forced to hear was interesting. By the end of the journey, I was silently complaining about the modern world, and feeling mad with FGW who, at the very moment when our carriage fell silent, would make an announcement about the buffet car (a carriage where food and drinks are sold) either opening or closing. FGW seems to be campaigning against peace and quietness, having removed quiet carriage spaces where passengers were requested not to use mobiles so that their trains could carry more passengers. How so? I cannot understand why FGW takes no notice of passengers like me, who have suffered a lot from hearing endless telephone conversations. I have no interest in the smallest details of others' lives. Making people listen to boring mobile phone conversations should be regarded as a rude act."" Every train carriage should, in theory, be quiet. Why can't that be the standard? It is possible to change public custom and practice. It was not so long ago that sidewalks were littered with dog waste:now it's a general rule that dog owners clean it up after their pets. And once we restore peace and quietness to trains, we can then move on and stop people bringing fast food onto them, too."	['was filled with anger']
What is the tone of the writing?	"The nuclear leak at the Fukushima power plant in Japan, which followed the deadly earthquake two weeks ago, has caused an unexpected reaction in China. A sudden panic buying of salt occurred in many areas of our country about a week after the disaster. Salt in these districts was almost bought up overnight. Some sellers wanted to make a fortune by raising the price. The panic buying was caused by two major rumors on the Internet: First, iodized salt can protect against radiation. Second, there might be a fall in sea-salt production following the nuclear pollution of the ocean. Such fears are not new. The same kind of panic happened with vinegar during the SARS outbreak and garlic in the time of the influenza period. How can rumors like this spread in such a large country as China? Chen Fang, a reporter with the China Youth Daily said that many Internet users say there is a ""crisis of trust"" in today's China. ""Experts don't have enough credibility and people don't trust all government announcements, either."" Chen said. However, Chen added that the rumors should not be exaggerated . Many salt-buyers didn't care; others simply failed to understand what experts and governments were talking about. They just did as their neighbors and friends did. It was a case of the blind following the blind - that was the real reason behind the big increase in the demand for salt. On March 20, the Ministry of Commerce said: ""The panic buying of salt has stopped and the market is back to normal."" He also said China has enough salt to satisfy demand. Now everything is back to normal, many want to return the salt they bought. But in the view of the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, ""It is true that these people paid extra money to buy the salt, but they created the crisis in the first place and caused the price to rise."" The newspaper continued: ""So there is no reason why they should get the money back."" Perhaps consumers should keep the salt to remind themselves that often rumors are without foundation."

The author waited until the light went green because _ .	"Last night I drove a long way (about 500 km) to return home. It was late and I was driving fast because I wanted to get home as soon as possible. So several times when I was driving behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road, I wanted to shout at the driver ahead. Then I came to a crossroad with a traffic light. As I drove near, it turned red. I stopped my car at once. I looked left,right and behind. I found no cars or persons -- I was alone on the road. The person who would come to the crossroad was at least a mile away in any direction. Certainly going through the light would cause no danger. I could pass the traffic light. But strangely enough, I just stopped there, waiting for several minutes until the light went green. I asked myself why I refused to run the light. Surely it was unnecessary for me to be afraid of danger or being fined , because there were no cars or police around at all. But I remained waiting until the light changed. When I finally got home, it was near midnight. My wife had fallen asleep. The question of why I stopped for that light came back to me again, because I stopped another two times for the red lights as ""special"" as the first one. I stopped, not because of the law, but because it was a good habit I had developed. In fact, we were used to doing something right just because we have made obeying the rules a good habit. We do it just because we should do it. I thought if another man met with the same thing, he would make the same choice. I believed so. And I could be trusted by others. I believed that everyone would and could control himself/herself well. It was amazing that we trusted each other to do the right things, wasn't it?"	['he was used to obeying traffic rules']
Which of the following is TRUE according to this passage?	Popular music in America is what every student likes. Students carry small radios with earphones and listen to music before class, after class, and at lunch. Students with cars buy large speakers and play the music loudly as they drive on the street. Adult drivers listen to music on the car radio as they drive to work. They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmers are music. Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or a tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star. There are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is western or country music. This was started by cowboys who would sing at night to the cows they were watching. Today, any music about country life and the 1ove between a country boy and his girl is called western or country music. ,.	['Students with cars in America like to listen to music while driving.']
We can learn from the text that _ .	"Well, parents, surprise! Lots of us are using Twitter and Facebook to thumb rides, and not just to school. It's awkward to be refused when you call a friend and ask for a ride. But with Twitter, you just look for other people heading the same way. It may sound risky, so many teens stay within their own social circles to find rides, and don't branch out beyond friends when asking on Twitter just like me, but to some young people, especially those taking longer trips, stranger danger is less of a concern. ""I think the digital connection of young people is really key, because younger generations grew up sharing things on line, sharing files, photos, music, etc, so they've been very used to sharing,"" said Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College. The sharing economy got big during the recession , allowing people to access more goods, services using technology and even to share costs. And that technology, for me, is what the car was for my mom, a gateway to more freedom, like what my friend Earl says, ""The symbol of freedom isn't the car any more because there's technology out there connecting you to a car."" According to the researchers at the University of Michigan, 30 years ago, eight in ten American 18-year-olds had a driver's license compared to six in ten today. So it's not that surprising that on my 16th birthday I wasn't rushing to get a license but an iPhone. ""Driving, for young people, does mean they have to disconnect from their technology, and that's a negative. So if they could sit in the passage side and still be connected, that's going to be a plus."" Schor continued. To me, another plus is that ridesharing represents something, something much bigger than trying to save money. I see it as evidence that people still depend on each other. My generation shares their cars and apartments the way neighbors used to share cups of sugar. For the system to work, some of us still need our own cars. But until I get my own version of the silver Super Beetle, you can find me on Twitter."	['ridesharing can be seen as a sign that people still count on each other']
The students brought their photos for the writer to look at _ .	"On the first day of the new term, I met my new headmaster at the school gate. ""Follow me, please!"" he said. He had a quiet, kind voice. He took me into my new classroom and left. In front of me, thirty pairs of eyes looked at me. I knew he had told the students that I was blind. I could almost feel the question behind their eyes: Blind? I felt the answer too: If she's blind, this should be good! I heard quiet voices in a corner of the classroom. For a moment, I felt afraid. I knew at once that I had to be strong. ""Class,"" I said as loudly as I could. ""I may be blind. But I am not foolish. Take those naughty smiles off your faces, and stop talking, please!"" Of course, I could not see their faces; I just guessed that some of them were smiling. The class were quiet. They were very surprised. I knew that I had done the right thing. As the days went by, the students had more surprises. I could smell when the children were eating sweets. I could easily hear combs going through hair, students passing messages, and so on. Once I found a girl passing a message to a friend. I took the message to the teachers' room. A teacher read it to me. On one side it said, ""Do you think she can see?"" on the other it said, ""I think so. She always knows what we're doing."" Soon the students stopped being naughty, and started to work hard. Before long, they brought in photos of their families for me to look at; I knew then they were my friends. I also knew they had forgotten that I could not see."	['to show their friendliness']
Which reason for using computerized books is NOT said in the passage?	Computers are very important to modern life. Many people think that in the future computers will be used a lot in everyday's life. It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be fewer books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games, see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers, too. Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating . Others do not think that computers will replace our old ways. Let's take books for example. Some people think that one day we won't read books made of paper. Instead, we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized books will be used more and more. Is Internet shopping such a pleasure as going to the shop? Many people say it is not. It is a pleasure to go into shops and look at things you want to buy. It is also unlikely that many people will want to read large texts on our computers. Because paper books will perhaps be more friendly. Maybe computers won't change these two habits .

People at California's Glace Luxury Ice Company probably want consumers to believe that _ .	"Many people believe that all ice cubes are created equal, but they are not. At least that's what the folks at California's Glace Luxury Ice Company would like us to believe. The Davisbased company says that the ice cubes they make are healthier and last longer than the ones that we throw into our drinks on a daily basis. What's more, the company also says that their ice cubes do mot leave behind an aftertaste in drinks, like regular ones do. In order to create these unique ice cubes, Glace Luxury begins with water that has been rid of the _ impurities that the company says can lead to cancer and exist in regular ice. They then freeze it in large blocks. Once ready, the ice is carved into perfect cubes and each cube measures 2.5 inches across. Besides being healthier, these ice cubes apparently also take longer to melt. The company says that each ice cube can last up to 30 minutes. Of course, those ice cubes do not come cheap. Those that wish to have a taste of this ""tasteless"" frozen perfection will have to pay $325USD for a bag of 50 ice cubes. That comes to $6.50USD for a single cube of ice! The unique product is the brainchild of Robert Sequeira, a former business school lecturer who said that he wanted to establish a profitable business that could be easily scaled. Given that he can make as mush Glace Luxury ice as he needs for as little as $0.12USD per cube, he thinks that the idea certainly meets the standard. Now, if he can find that the few people can afford to buy this Glace Luxury ice, life would be great!"	['their ice cubes are different']
The author, states that during wartime the regular sources of news provide only _ .	"Rumor is the most primitive way of spreading stories--- by passing them on from mouth to mouth, but civilized countries in normal times have better sources of news than rumor. They have radio, television, and newspapers. In times of confusion ( ), however, rumor appears and becomes widespread. At such times the different kinds of news are in competition: the press, television, and radio against the . Especially do rumors spread when war requires control on many important matters. The normal news sources no longer give out enough information. Since the people can not learn through legal channels all that they are anxious to learn, they pick up ""news"" wherever they can and when this happens, rumor grows. Rumors are often repeated even by those who do not believe the tales. There is an interest about them. The reason is that the cleverly designed rumor gives expression to something deep in the hearts of the victims -- the fears, doubts, forbidden hopes, or daydreams which they hesitate to voice directly. Pessimistic rumors about defeat and disasters show that the people who repeat them are worried and anxious. Optimistic rumors about record production or peace soon come point to self- satisfaction or confidence--and often to over-confidence."	['limited information']
In the author's opinion, _ .	It is a plain fact that we are in a world where competition is going on in all areas and at all levels. This is exciting.Yet,on the other hand,competition breezes a pragmatic attitude.People choose to learn things that are useful,and do things that are profitable.Today's college education is also affected by this general sense of utilitarianism . Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation. A certificate may give you some advantages,but not broad horizons,positive attitudes and personal integrity ,which are the wealth you cannot acquire through any quick fixed way. Although in today's world,the highest level of competition may not be that of skills or expertise ,but vision and strategy, your intellectual quality largely determines how far you can go in your career.

What will happen to Beijing hutongs?	"The Beijing Hutong (old lane) areas have a very special and important position in the rich history and culture of Beijing. While visiting the Beijing Hutong, you can appreciate the dramatic changes that the rest of Beijing has undergone. You can see evidence of the history of Beijing, experience the old way of life and experience traditional Beijing culture. The Beijing Hutong is made up of lanes or alleys formed by lines of pre-modern quadrangles (siheyuan), four-sided dwelling compounds or quadrangles consist of one-story courtyard houses, which make up old Beijing, and feature typical Chinese residential architecture. Beijing road classification was once s follow: A 36-foot-wide road was called a standard, street, an 18-foot-wide one was a small street and a 9-foot-wide lane was named a hutong. In fact, the Beijing Hutongs are unclassifiable by the traditional standard, ranging from 40 centimeters to 10 feet in width. The longest hutong has more than 20 turns. It is easy to get lost in the maze of winding lanes hat is the hutong, with the gray-tiled houses and deep alleys crossing each other, all identical in appearance, with many blind hutongs or culdesacs. Hutongs were first named as such in the Yuan Dynasty(1271-1368), with its Mongolian rulers having an influence on the Chinese language. However, siheyuan or quadrangles have probably been around much longer. The name of a hutong represents its origin, location or history. It is in the gray-tiled deep lanes that families play, travel, buy goods, gossip and connect. In beijingers'eyes, hutong means a period of history, a cordial lifestyle and even an ""encyclopedia of Beijing"". When urban construction threatens the existence of these hutongs, Beijingers become worried. Beijing still has about 400 000 residential quadrangles now, mainly distribute over the East, West, Xuanwu and Chongwen districts. The municipal government has marked a number of these compounds for protection. If you would like to have a glimpse into Beijing' Yesterday, you are highly recommended to have a short adventure trip to the Hutongs. Beijing Hutong Tour (Rickshaw Hutong, Bike Hutong and Walk Hutong) is organized by Beijing Xinhua International Tours."	['Government has taken measures to tp protect some of the hutongs.']
We can conclude form the article that _ .	"They lived thousands of miles apart, and both died in 1616. This has led to a lot of studies comparing their works,which are still important to this day. To mark the 400th anniversary of Tang Xianzu and William Shakespeare's deaths, an exhibition called Dialogue Across Time and Space: Homage to Tang Xianzu and William Shakespeare is being held across 26 Chinese Cultural Centers in different countries from Sept 1 to December. Shakespeare's plays are always found in the British school curriculum, while Tang's best-known opera, The Peony Pavilion , continues to be performed worldwide. Both were ""great men in the circle of world drama', according to Aoki Masaru, who put the work of Shakespeare and Tang together in his 1943 book A History of Chinese Literary Thought. Both shared a love for a journey of self-discovery. The difference is that Shakespeare's work shows people of all backgrounds and classes, while Tang's dramas come form a more aristocratic background. Tang's lines were sung mostly in family theaters. Shakespeare, however, had to sell tickets to whoever would buy them. That probably affected their writing styles. Though few can touch Shakespeare's range and richness of work, there is one area in which Tang's work may have been better. That's in the use of dreams, not only to tell a story, but also to explore ideas. The Peony Pavilion is set in the world of the characters' dreams, especially Du Liniang, the young lady who has not seen or gotten to know Liu Mengmei when she falls in love with him. After Liu has dreamed of her, he finds her portrait three years after her death and can't stop thinking about her. But for Du, a dream is a path to the freedom that young women of ancient China normally didn't have - the freedom to love someone without their families getting in the way. Shakespeare also famously used the stage to look at Philosophy in A Midsummer Night's Dream . But in a sense, the dream was Tang's stage."

What did the author study originally when he was in college?	"I decided to go back to school in the fall of 2008 after not being happy with my current job and financial status. I obtained my Associate's Degree in May 2002 in Commercial Arts. After graduation, I had trouble obtaining a job in that field. For years, I was going from one job to another feeling unfilled, and I was not satisfied with the instability. I decided to go back to school for either International Business or Psychology. I weighed the pros and cons of both professions and Psychology won. I like helping my friends and family, when they go through hard situations in their life by giving them sound advice and being honest with them. Also, I was interested in ""the mind"". I was searching for online schools because my work schedule at my current job would not allow me to attend a regular class. I was nervous about starting online classes because I heard mixed stories from other friends who were taking online classes. I decided to do it anyway to experience something different. I wanted to find an online school that was affordable and reputable. Through my search, I discovered Walden University, which is specially for working adults who want to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher. The process of getting accepted was easy, which included writing an essay on why I wanted to attend their school, transferring my previous credits, etc. I am currently enrolled in the Bachelors program for psychology, and I am paying for college via financial-aid loans and grants. This experience has been interesting yet trying as sometimes it was difficult to balance work, school and home life. I learned a lot about psychology and myself. For example, I like writing about current events, relationships and traveling. I thought my English composition was ordinary, but after taking a few classes at Walden University, I improved my English composition and it made me feel confident enough to start writing professionally so I became a freelance writer. Currently, I am only three classes away from obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology! It was one of the best decisions I made in my life."	['Commercial Arts']
Which of the following best tells the teacher's feeling about the incident?	One day a few years ago a very funny thing happened to a neighbor of mine. He is a teacher at one of London's big medical schools, He had finished his teaching for the summer term and was at the airport on his way to Russia to give a lecture. He had put a few clothes and his lecture notes in his shoulder bag, but he had put Rupert, the skeleton to be used in his lecture, in a large brown suitcase . At the airport desk, he suddenly thought that he had forgotten to buy a newspaper. He left his suitcase near the desk and went over to the shop. When he got back he discovered that someone had taken his suitcase by mistake. He often wonders what they said when they got home and found Rupert.	['He thinks it rather funny .']
Which of the following can be reasonable except _ .	Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss valued over 10 billion yuan.	['Nothing can be done on earthquakes']
According to the passage, dinosaurs did exist only _ on the earth.	Millions of years ago dinosaurs lived on the earth. In the days of dinosaurs the whole earth was warm and wet. There were green forests and they could find enough to eat. Later, parts of the earth became cold and dry. and the forests there died. Then dinosaurs could not find enough to cat. This must be one reason why dinosaurs died out. We can guess another reason. New kinds of animals came on the earth. Some had big brains and were fast and strong. They could kill dinosaurs. There may be other reasons that we don't know about yet. Scientists are trying to make more discoveries about dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were of many sizes and shapes . Some were as small as chickens, while some were about 90 feet long. There were also terrible fights between dinosaurs. They might have happened more than 100 million years ago. Though there was no man to see any of the fights, we can be told by the animal's footprints that fight did take place.	['millions of years ago']
The main reason for most people to collect phone cards is that _ .	Most British telephone cards are just plain green, but card collecting is becoming a popular hobby in Britain and collectors even have their own magazine, International Telephone Cards. One reason for their interest is that cards from around the world come in a wide variety of different and often very attractive designs. There are 100, 000 different cards in Japan alone, and there you can put your own design onto a blank card simply by using a photograph or a business card. The first telephone cards, produced in 1976, were Italian. Five years later the first British card appeared, and now you can buy cards in more than a hundred countries. People usually start collecting cards because they are attractive, small and light , and they do not need much space. It is also a cheap hobby for beginners, although for some people it becomes a serious business. In Paris, for example, there is a market where you can buy only telephone cards, and some French cards cost up to 4, 000 pounds. The first Japanese card has a value of about 28, 000 pounds. Most people only see cards with prices like these in their collectors magazine.	['they find the cards beautiful and easy to keep']
According to the writer, lifetime learning can be exciting if _ .	One of the biggest challenges facing students and their families is what career they should enter and what is the best path for them to take. I was talking to someone the other day who told me he first studied accounting because that was what everyone was studying several years ago. It was and some say still is a reliable career. However, then he told me that he was now studying financial investment because again--- that's what everyone was studying now and it was needed if he wanted to get ahead in the company. And I asked him what he was actually interested in and then-- well the conversation kind of died. So I asked why he had bothered studying accounting in the first place and he explained that it was his parents' idea. Finally I asked what his passion was and he wasn't too sure because he never thought about it. And so it is-- lifelong learning-- or the continual need to make ourselves marketable in a world that appears to be more competitive as time goes by. Is there a secret to help us so we can live a life of quality? Regardless or not at this stage in world history with increasing connection between people, ideas and markets -- the ability to match the needs and desires of the day with your own skills and products is a tremendous and vigorous challenge. Many have gone into English or foreign language study because it was encouraged at the time when China was entering the WTO. Or maybe they were interested in international affairs or working abroad. Upon graduation they then faced the reality that there was a limit to how many jobs they could apply for. Perhaps some then studied further doing courses for work such as a tour guide or translator/ interpreter. Many may have decided that going into teaching was more rewarding or stable. Others would have gone into media or advertising or conference management and acquired new skills along the way. This constant quest to remain ahead of the game makes many upset and exhausted. Some futurists who examine technology have even predicted that people should expect to change careers six or seven times during their lifetime! So if you are concerned by the nature of change, why not start spending more time looking at the most modern leading economies, institutions and their publications. A whole lot of changes are starting to happen yet there is no reason why this cannot be enjoyable, exciting and also rewarding. Our attitude, approach and willingness to continually learn and update our skills must remain strong. My tip is to track the work that our government is setting about to achieve. In particular, look at the people who have been chosen as the key support team and try to read behind the light surface news and look at their career development and examine the recent reports that they are now recommending the government move towards. Key industry development, new ways of dealing with information and new demands are creating opportunities for the students and workers of tomorrow -- if we stay prepared.

Why do most people hate to do clothes - ironing?	"Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, ""Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?"" she probably would have answered, ""Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!"" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do."

If Elizabeth had married a foreign prince, there might have been _ .	"""I will never marry,"" the future Elizabeth I declared at the age of eight, and, to the terror of her people, the Great Queen kept her word. For four centuries, historians have guessed why Elizabeth never married.In her own day, her decision to remain single was considered absurd and dangerous.A queen needed a husband to make political decisions for her and to organise and lead her military campaigns.More important, she needed male heirs to avoid a civil war after her death. There was no shortage of suitors for the Queen, both English courtiers and foreign princes, and it was confidently expected for the best part of 30 years that Elizabeth would eventually marry one of them.Indeed, although she insisted that she preferred the single state, she kept these suitors in a state of permanent expectation.This was a deliberate policy on the Queen's part, since by keeping foreign princes in hope, sometimes for a decade, she kept them friendly when they might otherwise have made war on her kingdom. There were, indeed, good political reasons for her avoiding marriage.The disastrous union of her sister Mary I to Philip II of Spain had had an unwelcome foreign influence upon English politics.The English were generally prejudiced against the Queen taking a foreign husband, particularly a Catholic one.Yet if she married an English, jealousy might lead to the separation of the court. There were other, deeper reasons for Elizabeth's unwillingness to marry, chief of which, I believe, was her fear of losing her autonomy as Queen. In the 16th century, a queen was regarded as holding supreme dominion over the state, while a husband was thought to hold supreme dominion over his wife.Elizabeth knew that marriage and motherhood would bring some harm to her power. She once pointed out that marriage seemed too uncertain a state for her. She had seen several unions in her immediate family break down, including that of her own parents. Some writers, based on very fragile evidence, have argued that Elizabeth was frightened or incapable of the sex act, but it is more likely that she feared childbirth. Two of her stepmothers, her grandmother and several acquaintances had died in childbed. Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII, had had her mother, Anne Boleyn, killed; her stepmother Catherine Howard later suffered the same fate. When Elizabeth was 14 she was all but attracted by Admiral Thomas Seymour, who also went to the prison within a year. Witnessing these terrible events at an early age, it has been argued, may have put Elizabeth off marriage. Elizabeth had to decide her priorities. Marriage or being single? Elizabeth was far too intelligent.The choice she made was courageous and revolutionary, and, in the long run, the right one for England."	['a negative impact on English politics']
Tea and coffee were first introducd to Europe in _ .	When tea and coffee were first introduced to Europe in the 18th century, people had different ideas about their use.Some said that tea and coffee were harmful to humans and they could cause people to die. In Sweden , King Gustaf III decided to find out whether or not this was true.It happened that there were two brothers in prison at that time.They were twins and were almost alike in every way.They had both been sentenced to death .The King decided to let them live if one of the men agreed to drink several cups of tea each day and the other several cups of coffee. Both brothers lived many years without problems of any kind.At last,the brother who had drunk tea every day died at the age of 83,the other died a few years later. Because of the experiment , tea and coffee got accepted and became popular as drink in Sweden, and it is one of the many countries of the world where much tea and coffee is drunk today.

Which of the following is NOT the advantage of Horton?	At first glance, there is little in Horton to attract people. The other nearby towns have much more to offer: Bradfield has its river and historic buildings, while Newtown has shops and entertainment. The buildings of Horton look dirty and unloved. For shops, there is a small supermarket, a few bargain shops, a bakery which, strangely, does not sell bread and a florist which has one stand of sad-looking flowers. Even so, Horton has several advantages over its neighbouring towns. Firstly, it has a country park. Four thousand years ago, this was an important fort. There are no historic remains here now, but there are wonderful views over the countryside. On sunny weekends you can often see kids out with their parents, kicking balls or flying kites. There aren't many job opportunities in Horton, and the roads to nearby cities aren't really fast, but there are excellent rail links. You can be in London in an hour and a half, and other cities are less than an hour away. That means that parents can earn a good salary and still get home in time to spend the evenings with their families. Houses in Horton aren't pretty, but they're functional and cheap. The streets are quiet and safe, and there are plenty of parks and playgrounds. It has a library, three primary schools and a secondary school, St. Mark's. It is friendly and offers a wide range of subjects and activities to children of all abilities and backgrounds. The town also has a swimming and a sports centre, and the community halls hold regular clubs and events for people of all ages.	['historical buildings']
The main purpose of this passage is to _ .	Whether you were the shy one at high school or the most popular person on campus, starting university is a clean paper for everyone. It's the best time to develop your skills with different people, such as teachers, classmates, and roommates. Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation. You can also take out your earphones when someone asks to share a table with you in the common room while you're studying. Try to get along with roommates Getting along with roommates is a challenge you'd be wise to overcome. You live together, so you will often spend time together without even trying to. It's important to make sure that dorm life doesn't make you unhappy. You should be cautious about facing your roommates over any problems, especially if you have only just met. Remember, be polite but firm. The key is to set expectations and clear boundaries from the beginning. Let your roommates know your life habits, but also observe and respect theirs. Sleeping times and studying schedules, visiting friends and cleaning duties are just some of the topics you should discuss. Avoid drama and gossip As you already know from high school, your social life will be much more pleasant if you avoid causing and getting caught up in drama, no matter whether in class, dorm, or elsewhere. When it comes to gossip, learn to keep your mouth shut and you'll avoid trouble. This is especially important if you live in a dorm, where staying away from someone you've offended is difficult.

What's the main idea of the passage?	"Mei Lun and Mei Huan have been the first giant twin pandas born in the US since 1987. The names of these twin male giant panda cubs were announced at Atlanta Zoo last year. Lun Lun, a 15-year-old giant panda, gave birth to the cubs on July 15, 2013. Zoo officials followed Chinese custom and named the brothers after waiting 100 days. Until then, they were simply known as ""Cub A"" and "" Cub B"". Mei Lun and Mei Huan are the first twin panda cubs to survive in the Unite States. ""We're delighted to finally be able to place two youngsters with names. They have not only made a mark on the history of Atlanta Zoo, but also have made history in the US,"" Raymond B. King , the zoo's president and CEO, said in a statement. Atlanta Zoo teamed up with Good Morning America that month to put the pandas' names to a public vote. China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding provided the choices of names. In just 13 days, 51,000 votes poured in on the show's website. Under a deal between China and the US, giant pandas originally from China are only lent to foreign zoos for scientific study for several years. Zookeepers at Atlanta Zoo are giving regular updates on the twins' progress in an online blog. Mei Lun and Mei Huan are the fourth and fifth offspring of Lun Lun and a male giant panda named Yang Yang. The pandas made their first public appearance in a US exhibit last fall. For the three months before their appearance, the online world had watched the twins grow strong and healthy. ""We share this joy with our colleagues in China and with the cub's fans around the world,"" King said."	['The names of the twin pandas were announced.']
When they arrived at the hotel, they found _ .	"Mr and Mrs Smith had always spent their summer holidays in New Jersey in the past, staying in a small inn at the foot of a hill. One year, however, Mr. Smith made a lot of money in his business, so they decided to go to London and stay at a really good hotel while they went touring around that famous city. They flew to London and arrived at their hotel late one evening. They expected that they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small inn in New Jersey, no meals were served after seven. They were therefore surprised when the man who received them in the hall asked whether they would take dinner there that night. ""Are you still serving dinner?"" asked Mr Smith. ""Yes, certainly, sir,"" answered the man. ""We serve it until half past nine."" ""What are the times of meals then?"" asked Mr Smith. ""Well, sir,"" answered the man, ""We serve breakfast from seven to half past eleven in the morning, lunch from twelve to three in the afternoon, tea from four to five, and dinner from six to half past nine."" ""But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the sights of London!"" said Mrs Smith."	['dinner was still being served']
The passage may come from _ .	"How green are you? Do you know how to be green? We all need a healthy environment, but we produce waste every day and it does harm to our environment. Though we are young,we can still do something to help. In fact, even the simplest everyday activities can make a real difference to the environment. Here are some ideas for you. Reduce Reduce means ""use less"",Don't waste things. This saves money and reduces pollution and waste going into the environment. Before we buy something new, think whether it is really necessary--or maybe the old one will be just as good! When we do buy things, choose local products if possible, and try not to buy too many things from abroad. Reuse Reuse means ""use again"". Use things for as long as possible. When we buy things,make sure that they last a long time. We should look after them so that they will last, and we should repair them if we can instead of throwing them away and buying new ones. Don't use a paper cup or a paper bag. It's better to use a china cup and a lunch box because you can use them again. Recycle Recycle means ""change things into something else"". Though it takes energy to change something into something else, it's better than throwing things away or burning them. Find out what can be recycled in your neighbourhood and take part in recycling programmes. We should also buy products made from recycled materials,such as recycled paper, to help save trees. So please remember these three words:reduce, reuse and recycle."	['a magazine']
What does Yang Yi think of her work?	"Upon entering college, Yang Yi was uncertain about a lot of things. However, the 19-year-old international economics and trade student was certain about one thing: She wanted to participate in animal welfare efforts. ""I'm .always a nature and animal lover,"" she said. She joined the environmental protection association at her school. Now being president of a group of 25, she leads its efforts to help stray cats and dogs by raising money to buy them food and collecting old clothes to make them homes. However, sometimes the association raises doubts. Some students have questioned whether helping stray animals breaks the laws of nature. ""We tried to resolve the controversy,"" Yang said. ""For wild animals, the best way to protect them is to preserve their environment and their natural habitat, and to let them live their own way. However, for animals that depend heavily on humans, such as dogs and cats, the proper way to treat them is to respect them and take care of them."" Besides, if not accommodated properly, stray animals can bring threats to public health, as they are the main cause of rabies in cities. ""Now, many young people in China have agreed upon the need to strike a balance between humans and nature. The only problem is how,"" said Yang. Yang and her fellow volunteers are cautious about what they do to help. For instance, sometimes people feed stray cats human food such as chocolate. But Yang and her friends point that such food can be dangerous to stray cats. Yang also cooperates with Non-Governmental Organizations to spread animal protection knowledge. One of their recent exhibits was about animals in the entertainment industry. ""We are still figuring out the best way to protect animals, but simple deeds such as saying no to animal performances can prevent wildlife from being captured and tamed. Step by step, we'll eventually reach our goal,"" she said."	['Hopeful.']

Which of the following is NOT true about body language?	Body language has always been a hot topic of interesting dinner conversations. It is perhaps one of the most powerful forms of human expression or human communication! Body language is a very important part of communication which can constitute 50% or more of what we are communicating to other persons. If you wish to communicate effectively, besides the words, you can use your body to say what you mean. Body language can be used to discover all sorts of things such as, knowing when someone is attracted to you, finding truth or lies, showing confidence, winning respect in any situation, and you can use body language to make people less nervous, make friends quickly, persuade and influence. So what is body language? Body language is a term used to describe the method of communication using body movements or gestures instead of, or besides, spoken language or other communication. Body language also includes many movements that most people are not aware of, such as winking and slight movements of the eyebrows and other facial expressions. Body language is one of the easiest ways for you to tell what's really going on in a conversation with another person. The body language that you observe from other people will tell you whether or not those people are telling you the truth, or whether there is something more that's not being said. Watch, look and observe. Sometimes you can tell more by a person's body language than the words he speaks.	"[""It's only needed when we have nothing to say.""]"
Several companies are racing to _ .	On school nights, lots of kids have to do their reading before they are allowed to watch TV. Pretty soon, you might get to do both at the same time, in true Harry Potter style. Several companies are racing to produce electronic paper and ink, complete with colors and moving imagines . One idea would be to create a newspaper like The Daily Project in the Harry Potter books. Its pages would hold video clips of baseball games instead of just black-and-white photos. Electronic paper is not a new idea. A company in Massachusetts called E ink, for example, has been working for years on such a technology. Little electricity determines whether each microsphere looks black or white at any given time. Together, microspheres make up words and imagines. The techniques seems promising for creating still imagines that can be changed when needed, but the process is too slow for good videos. Scientists in the Netherlands now report a new type of e-paper technology. By using layers of oil, the requirements. They can also make images which change fast enough to meet standard video requirements. They can also make brilliant colors,. So far, however, each image is smaller than the fingernail. For now, reading and watching TV will have to return two separate activities. Keep your eyes open, though, in the future, TV watching and reading might be part of the same work.

Which of the following statements is TRUE, according to this passage?	"There is growing concern about food insecurity in the developing world. Rising food prices, weather emergencies and political problems are deepening the struggle for families in many countries. Three UN agencies have published a report recently, saying high prices are likely to continue. Gregory Barrow, who is with the World Food Program in Rome, says, ""If you look at the places where the World Food Program works, particularly in developing countries, you see people who might be spending more than 60 percent of their salary in purchasing food for their families."" East Africa is suffering its worst drought in years. In Kenya, at least three and a half million people are going hungry, mostly in the north. Yet food is going to waste in central Kenya. Now, farmers there want the government to buy their food and give it to those in need. Farmers say bad roads and lack of transportation make it difficult for them to get their produce to the market. Mr. Barrow says, ""It needs the government to make some arrangements such as providing transport. They can buy it at a good price, then give it to those people instead of asking for food from overseas, which is very bad. When we are throwing away food, _ are asking for food from overseas."" Economists say that imports reduce local food prices, decrease productivity and increase the dependency on other countries. Farmers in Kenya hope the government can pay higher prices for their crops so that they can feed more Kenyans."	['Economists believe importing food from abroad may cause problems.']
Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"Thousands of taxi drivers in Shenyang, Liaoning province, reportedly blocked streets with their vehicles on Sunday in protest against unlicensed vehicles using taxi-hiring apps and apps-based car rental companies providing passenger services, including high-end cars. Although the drivers also complained about the withdrawal of the fuel subsidy by the government, their main complaint was the loss of business because of the rising number of Internet-based car services companies. On Wednesday, news reports came that Beijing transport authorities will take measures to stop the illegal ""taxi business"" of private cars through the newly rising Internet apps, following the footsteps of Shenyang and Nanjing.[:Z#xx#k.Com] It is not yet clear how the Shenyang city government will handle the issue and whether it will declare the services offered by market leaders such as Didi Dache, a taxi-hiring app provider backed by Tencent Holdings, and Kuaidi Dache illegal. But Shanghai transport regulators have set a rule, by banning Didi Zhuanche, or car services offered by Didi Dache in December. Such regulations will cause a setback to the car-hiring companies and investors that are waiting to cash in on the potentially booming business. Just last month, Didi Dache got $700 million in funding from global investors, including Singapore state investment company Temasek Holdings, Russian investment company DST Global and Tencent. Besides, the market is uncertain that Kuaidi Dache is about to finalize its latest round of funding after getting $800 million from global investors. Regulatory uncertainties, however, could cast a shadow on the future of the Internet-based car-hiring services, which have become popular in most of China's big cities. To be fair, these companies' business model is anything but bad. For example, Didi Zhuanche works side by side with established car rental companies to provide high-end car service mainly for businesspeople through the Internet and mobile phone apps. Every link in this business model chain has legal companies and services. Hence, it is hard to define it as illegal and ban it."	['The problem mentioned in the passage exists in all cities']
What's the writer's purpose in writing this passage?	"WASHINGTON--There are more than 222 million TVs in American homes. And it would make Frank Vespe very happy this week if every one was turned off. Vespe is head of the TV--Turnoff Network, the Washington organization behind TV Turnoff Week. For TV Turnoff week, American kids are encouraged to go one week without watching TV. This year it runs from April 23 to 29. ""Our real meassage here is to see what lift is like without TV and then make watching TV a conscious decision,""said Vespe. Vespe said that most of the kids who go without television for a week go back to watching, but not as much.""They watch more selectively. They do more things as a family. It helps them put TV in its place. One kid who is turning off her television is Sarah Foote, 9, of Virginia."" Sarah admits it won't be too hard to give up TV. She's allowed to watch only educational television, and her favourite show from last year isn't on any more. Of course, there are plenty of good things about TV: programmes can be entertaining, even educational. Even so, some experts aren't sure TV Turnoff Week is the answer. ""Too much TV is not good. A little bit of TV for young kids is good because it adds to their vocabulary. The bottom line is moderation ,""says Susan Neuman, a university educator who studies kids and reading. Neuman says the real problem is that parents do not keep track of what their kids are watching. They do not set limits on TV viewing. Also, in some families, TV might be the only thing there is to do. What message does Sarah have for other kids? ""It's a very good idea. I survived a whole week without TV. It also teaches you to enjoy time doing different things and not being sucked into something on TV, because you do not want TV taking up all of your time,""Sarah said."

Which of the following can best show the theme of this text?	Mrs. Amatuli was my teacher in the fourth grade. One day at lunch time,I was getting ready to eat my same old tuna fish sandwich and suddenly Mrs. Amatuli asked me if she could buy my sandwich from me. She explained that I could use the money to buy a hot lunch from the cafeteria. I was thrilled. I never bought my lunch at the cafeteria. It was too expensive for my family,and I always carried my lunch and brought the bag back home to use again the next day. My sandwiches were either bologna or tuna fish. It rarely varied beyond that. You can understand my delight when I had the opportunity to buy a hot lunch. When we finished lunch that day. Mrs. Amatuli took me aside and said she wanted to explain why she had bought my sandwich. I really didn't care why, but it gave me a few minutes of her precious attention so I was very quiet as she explained. You see,she was Catholic and she told me that Catholics didn't eat red meat on Fridays--they ate fish on Fridays. Oh,I couldn't wait to get home and tell my mama that from now on 1 wanted tuna fish on Fridays. After my mama understood why,she gladly fixed tuna fish for me on Fridays. She even fixed it on brown bread because she knew Mrs. Amatuli liked brown bread. From then on. every Friday I could get in line with the rest of the kids for a hot lunch. I didn't care how many of the kids complained about cafeteria food--it tasted _ to me! I realize now that Mrs. Amatuli could have fixed herself a tuna sandwich of Friday. But she bought my sandwich because she saw a 1ittle girl who was thrilled over the simple act of having a hot lunch. I will never forget her for her compassion and generosity and what I should do is to follow her example.	['Love makes the world go around.']

How many planes disappeared altogether that day?	At 2:30 December 5, 1945, five US Navy training planes took off in clear weather from the base Lauderdale, Florida. The planes flew east over the coast... and disappeared. The group was Flight 19, on a run between Florida and Bahamas. Tailor was the group leader. At about 3:40, Tailor reported that his compasses were not reading properly. The other planes followed their leaders aimlessly, first east, then west, then northeast over the ocean, as Tailor tried to make sure of the direction by radio. Then, suddenly Tailor was heard to give orders to dive... Quickly, two giant Martin seaplanes were sent up to search for Flight 19. Several hours later, the wind became strong and visibility dropped. A return to base was ordered. But only one of the Martin seaplanes landed. Four days later, the Navy and Coast Guard _ a 100,000 square--mile area with more than 100 planes and ships. No sign was ever shown of the missing planes. Today, people have noted the disappearance of many ships and planes in the southwest part of the North Atlantic and began to call this area the Bermuda Triangle. The points of the triangle are Bermuda, Puerto Rico and a particular place in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Florida. It is a two--faced water world of tiny islands, bright beaches and beautiful waters. Yet thick fogs, powerful currents and sudden storms are hidden behind this smiling surface.	['Six']
The original purpose of the talking kitchen is to _ .	"A ""talking kitchen"" teaches students how to cook French dishes and speak French. Researchers at New Castle University have developed the French Digital Kitchen. Professors Paul Seedhouse and Patrick Olivier led the project. Professor Seedhouse says that it works like a satellite navigation system in a car. The kitchen equipment and tools use motion sensor technology similar to the Nintendo Wii game system. The sensors help a computer guide the students through instructions in French. The system can tell whether you've done what you were asked to do or not. For example, the system tells you to take some butter and cut it with a knife. There's a sensor on the package containing the butter so it can tell where the butter's being moved. The sensor in the knife not only knows that the knife is moving, but it also knows what motion the knife is making. So it can tell whether the knife is being used. And so it doesn't go on to the next stage of the program unless you've done what it tells you to do. Students can ask the computer to repeat the instructions or translate them into English. There are vocabulary lessons before and after the cooking. Professor Seedhouse became interested in the idea after he visited a talking kitchen designed for a different purpose. ""It was actually for communicating with people who suffer from dementia "" .And so, for example, it can speak to those people and tell them that they've left the cooker on and they should turn it off."""

Economics can help one make better decisions because he learns _ .	Economics is the study of how societies with limited resources decide what to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce. What, how, and for whom to produce are problems all over the world because human needs are practically unlimited, but all societies have only limited quantities of resources that can be used to produce goods or services. A knowledge of basic economics is important for understanding both the problems and opportunities that will face the world economy in the 21st century. As a student of economics, one will have the chance to discover how commerce , government policies, and day-to-day decisions made by consumers affect his living standards. The study of economics can help him understand the influence of such events as the move to free markets in prefix = st1 /PolandandRussia, or of ups and downs in interest rate and the foreign exchange rate. Economics is influenced by developments in the many different areas of business, politics, science, nature, religion and history. And whether or not one is aware of it, economics is an important part of his life. From a practical point of view, one's study of economics will help improve his decision-making skills. He learns a logical way to compare different courses of action. As he studies the concept of opportunity cost, for instance, he will discover that every choice he makes has both a benefit and a cost. Suppose someone decides to get a part-time job so he can earn enough money to buy a car. He will have the benefit of owning the car, but he will pay a cost in terms of the leisure hours he gives up for working so as to pay for the car and keep it in good condition. After weighing his choice in cost-benefit terms, he may decide he does not need a car any more.	['how to weigh the cost and the benefit']

According to the passage ,around the year1990 most women married _ .	The greatest recent changes have ,been in the lives of women ,During the twentieth century there was an unusual shortening of the time of a woman's life spent in caring for children. A woman marrying at the end of the 19th century would probably have been in her middle twenties ,and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived till they were five years old ,By the time the youngest was fifteen ,the mother would have been id her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years ,during which custom ,chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work, Today women marry younger and have fewer children Usually a woman 's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty Even while she has the care of children ,her work is lightened by household appliances and convenience foods. This important change in women's way of life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women' s economic position Even a few years ago most girls left school at the first opportunity and most of them took a full-time job However ,when they married ,they usually left work at once and never returned to it ,Today the school-leaving age is sixteen ,many girls stay at school after that age ,and though women tend to marry younger ,more married women stay at work at leas until shortly before their first child is born Very many more after wads ,return to full or part-time work Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage ,with both husband and wife accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfaction of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more e-qually in providing the money and running the home ,according to the abilities and inter-est of each them.

They often travel very far, sometimes even halfway around the world. Some animals make one of these amazing journeys every year, while others make only one amazing journey in their lives. Some animals travel over land, some through water and others in the air. Green turtles spend most of their lives in the sea, but they come to the shore to lay their eggs. Every two or three years, fully-grown female turtles swim a long way to the same beach where they were hatched and lay their eggs there. Some turtles may travel over 1240 miles to reach the same beach. No one knows how these turtles are able to find the same beach again. Monarch butterflies live in North America. At the end of summer, they fly south to Mexico. In spring, they fly back north. During this journey, the adults lay their eggs and then they die. When the young butterflies hatch, they continue the journey north. No one knows how the young butterflies know where to go.	['Young monarch butterflies fly back to Mexico after they hatch.']
We know from the passage that Harriet was Mister Brodas' .	One day, a slave owner entered a local store and threatened a young boy who was his slave. At first, the slave refused to move and ran for the door. The slave owner reached for a heavy weight. He threw it at his slave. Instead, it hit Harriet on the head. Harriet almost died. For the rest of her life, she carried the mark of a deep wound on her head. Miser Brodas felt he never needed Harriet. He decided to sell her. Harriet thought of a way to prevent this. Each time she was shown to someone who might buy her, she acted as if she were falling asleep. After a while, Mister Brodas gave up the hope of selling Harriet. He sent her back to the fields. At 24 she married a free black man, John Tubman. By then, Harriet was sure she should escape. In 1849, Mister Brodas died. His slaves probably would be sold to further South. John Tubman tried to make Harriet forget about running away. Harriet decided she must end her marriage and that she needed to tell her family that she was leaving. Harriet escaped for Pennsylvania where slavery was banned there. Once she hid under hay that had been cut from the fields. Another time, she wore men's clothing. Finally, she arrived in Pennsylvania. Now that Harriet was free, she didn't forget other slaves in Maryland. During the next ten years, she freed her parents and other family members. She traveled back and forth eighteen times, helping about 300 slaves escape. She became an expert at hiding from slave hunters. At one time, anyone finding Harriet was promised 40,000dollars for catching her--dead or alive. The people she helped called her Moses. She had rescued them from slavery just as the biblical Moses rescued the Jews. After the Civil War began, Harriet started to spy for the North. She also served as a nurse. After four years of bloody fighting, the North won the war. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in 1863. There was no longer any need for Harriet to be Moses.	['slave']
We can conclude from the passage that Robert _ .	Robert Burns, the son of a hard-working and intelligent farmer, was the oldest of seven children. Although always hard pressed financially, their father encouraged his sons with their education. As a result, Burns not only read the Scottish poetry of Ramsay and the collections by Hailes and Herd, but also the works of Pope, Locke, and Shakespeare. By 1781, Burns had tried his hand at several agricultural jobs without success. Although he had begun writing, and his poems were spread widely in manuscript , none were published until 1786, when Burns published Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786), which was an immediate success. Later Burns brought out a second edition of his poems at Edinburgh in 1787, and for two winters he was socially active in the Scottish city. In 1788 he retired to a farm at Ellis land. By 1791 Burns had failed as a farmer, and he moved to Dumfries, where he held a position as a tax collector. He died of illness at 37. Burns's art is at its best in songs such as My Heart's in the Highlands. Some of his songs, such as Auld Lang Syne and Comin' thro' the Rye, are among the most familiar and best-loved songs in the English language. But his talent was not limited to songs; two descriptive pieces, Tam o' Shanter and The Jolly Beggars, are among his masterpieces. Burns had a fine sense of humor, which was reflected in his satirical , descriptive, and playful poems. His great popularity with the Scots lay in his ability to describe the life of his fellow rural Scots. His use of dialect brought an energetic, much-needed freshness into English poetry.	['was a failure in managing farms but a success in art']
The crowd stopped cheering suddenly because _ .	"The crowd stopped their talks as the runners came to the starting line. At this moment, all eyes were on two people, Mark, the favorite for the gold medal, and Jim, a new face to all. Mark had won a lot of competitions in 3000 meters and was thought to be the finest runner in the country. Until a few months before, Jim was almost unknown outside his hometown. But he had won one competition after another, which was a big surprise. Many people thought Jim would also do very well this time. It was going to be an exciting race. Bang! The race started. For the first half, Jim ran with Mark in the leading group. At 1700 meters, Jim was about one meter behind Mark. Suddenly, the crowd stopped cheering. Mark fell and lay on the grass. He tried to get up, but he had been injured and was out of the race. The crowd believed that Jim had tripped( ) Mark and they began to shout at him. Jim looked back and slowed down. Then _ . But the race was over for Jim, too. He was far behind others now. Jim was very unhappy because of what had happened. Later, after the judges had studied the video of the race, they decided that Jim had done nothing wrong . Jim went to see Mark and said, ""I'm sorry for ..."" ""It's not your fault. I got injured myself in the leg. Such a thing never happens to me. I've got to see the doctor,"" The two went on to become good friends and were often seen training together."

What would be the best title for the passage?	"Dad was always full of advice, but one of the biggest lessons he taught me one summer was about having a strong work ethic . When my brother and I were growing up, we mowed yards during the summer to earn pocket change. Dad was our salesman. He told our neighbors about our service and offered a price they could not refuse. My brother and I got $ 10 per yard. I later found out that our friends were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work. Every time we headed out to mow lawns , Dad was there to watch. I used to wonder why he came with us. He stood supervising our work in the heat when he could have been inside relaxing with air conditioning and an icy drink. One day we were cutting our next-door neighbor's yard, he always waited until the grass was knee-high to call us over. To make matters worse, we had an old lawn mower. This particular afternoon, I was finishing up and was tired and sweaty. I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece of grass. He yelled, ""You missed a piece."" I frowned, hoping he would let it slide and let me go home. He kept pointing. So, tired and disappointed, I went back to cut that piece of grass. I said to myself, ""That one piece isn't hurting anyone. Why won't he just let it go?"" But when I reached adulthood, I understood his message ---When you're running a business, the work you do says a great deal about you. If you want to be seen as an entrepreneur with honesty, you must deliver a quality product. That single blade of grass meant the job was not done. Other neighbors took notice of the good work we did and we soon got more business. We started out with one client, but by the end of the summer we had five."	['Honesty']
The ride-share cars were driven by _ drivers.	"Mistrust _ Zhengzhou Ride-share Effort More than 300 private car owners from a central Chinese city volunteered to offer free rides to citizens to ease crowded public transportation, but many local people didn't accept the offer for fear of being cheated. The ride-share program was begun in October in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province, when Ye Zhantong, a private car driver, started to gather volunteers to offer the free service. The drivers tied a green silk ribbon on the car to differentiate themselves from unlicensed taxi drivers. But the free rides haven't been popular among the public as increasing reports of dishonesty have dried up many local citizens' trust towards strangers. Ye said some of the volunteers have dropped out after they felt their kind intention was being questioned. Passersby walking in heavy rainfall or passengers who missed a bus would remain silent and walk away when the volunteers would stop and offer a ride. ""It's so common that people give us the cold shoulder, and sometimes, take our kindness as ill will,"" said one of Ye's volunteers, identified as Binge. ""Many would even say: 'Let's get out of here quickly to avoid being cheated by him.'"" Some commenters on Weibo explained why they hesitated to participate in a ride-share program. ""Trusting a stranger might bring huge risks. I can't take the risk,"" one Internet user wrote. Some said Ye's group wasn't authorized, and cheaters pretending to be kind drivers might volunteer. They suggested traffic authorities issue rules to regulate, protect and promote ride-share programs."	['private car']
How do the users avoid the danger of downloading information?	"Who is reading your blogs or checking out your information online? Two reports show that surfing the Internet and sending personal information to people you do not know could be a problem. Most sites give users their own webspace where they can write their diaries or post their pictures. The sites encourage users to get their friends to look at their work and to comment on what are posted on the sites. Teachers are worried that some children are posting their personal information on websites. This could put them at risk from those who plan to do harm to young people. Teachers are also worried some users think it is OK to use the websites in a way that could get others into trouble. In a school in Illinois in the US where some popular sites are used wildly, the school would punish students who posted pictures or information about smoking , drinking and other illegal activities on the websites. The school is now going to encourage its 3,200 students to obey a new rule. The warning is clear. That is, be careful when posting information about yourself such as your age, sex, address and interests on a website that anyone can see. Another warning about the Internet comes from a report. It shows searchers are leading users to websites that show them spam and other dangerous downloads.The words "" free _ "" were found to be the most dangerous words that people search for. It is well-known that visiting sites offering free MP3s leave users at serious risk. Spyware should be installed on their computers. So, happy surfing ,but remember not to get caught in the Net!"

Which makes it hard for you to make a decision?	You've just found your dream job, but it pays less than the one you've working hard at right now. What should you do ? How can you make the right decision ? When you have a difficult decision to make , you may probably think it over and over again for hours, weighting up all the advantages and disadvantages before coming to a decision .Or ,maybe you decide it quickly without thinking carefully .But according to scientific research, there's a better way to do this: Sleep on it . In a resent study , scientists made an experiment . They offered the participants some information about different types of cars .And they asked them to decide hypothetically which one would be the best fit. Some of them were asked to make the decision right away ,while others were asked to choose the next morning. The result of the survey was interesting. The people who had a good night's sleep were energetic the next morning .And they choose the best quality cars. But those who made quick decisions chose cars with bad quality. So ,if someone asks you to make a big decision ,don't rush to give an answer at once .Instead ,take a step back and get a good night's sleep. Chances are that ,in the morning , you'll know exactly what to do .	['You get less money from the dream job.']

The idea of the first Paralympics was _ .	Athens 2004 Paralympics: Biggest and Best Ever The Paralympics are the games for sports men and women with a disability. They were the idea of Doctor Ludwig Guttman, a doctor working at Stoke Mandeville hospital in the UK. This famous hospital looks after people who can no longer walk, or cannot move at all. After the Second World War, in 1945, the hospital was full of badly injured soldiers. To give them hope, Dr Guttman started the Paralympics in 1948. They were held at the same time as the London Olympics; doctors gave out the prizes and nurses were employed as referees . The first official Paralympics took place in Rome in 1960, with 400 athletes from 23 countries competing. By 2004 they had become ten times bigger: nearly 4,000 athletes from 140 countries competed in 19 different sports. The youngest competitor was the 11-year-old swimmer Xu Qingqing from China, the oldest, 66-year-old David Williams, a sailor from Canada. The games were a great success for China, the oldest, 66-year-old David Williams, a sailor from Canada. The games were a great success for China, which won 141 medals, 63 of them gold. Britain came second with 94 medals, 35 of them gold. China's disabled dance team closed the games with a wonderful dance performance. The games were also a success for the organizers. Ever since the failure of the Paralympics in Atlanta, USA, in 1996, the organizers have been nervous of empty seats. But in Australia in 2000, the Paralympics were shown every day on TV and a million tickets were sold. Fifty thousand Australian schoolchildren were in the stadiums for the Sydney Paralympics, shouting and cheering. However pleased they were by the crowds, some of the competitors found this quite difficult. One blind runner said that for the first 800 meters of the 10,000 meter race he could not hear where the other runners were because of the noise. Whatever his feelings about it, he still won a gold; and in Athens 2004 the crowds were even bigger and noisier. When the British team got back to London after the games of 2004, more crowds came to welcome them home. Slowly, the Paralympic athletes are becoming as popular and as famous as the Olympic stars.

From this passage, we can make a conclusion that _ .	"One afternoon, Coyote went hunting. Suddenly, a large frog laughed in front of him. Coyote pounced and pinned Frog to the ground. Frog thought quickly and came up with a plan. ""Brother Coyote,"" he called. ""You must not eat me today!"" Coyote laughed loudly, _ ""Why, I have a bet to make with you,"" Frog stated. ""Tomorrow there is to be a race."" Coyote's ears twitched. ""A race?"" ""Yes,"" Frog continued. ""You and I will race. If you win, then you may eat me."" Coyote agreed. Frog hurried to the lake. In the morning, the animals gathered to watch as Coyote and Frog agreed on the course they would run. They were to start at the large stone and circle all the way around the lake. The first one back to the stone would be the winner. When the sun reached the noonday mark, they were off. Coyote ran as quickly as he could. Frog bounded into the grass and waited. Coyote looked behind him. Seeing no sign of Frog, Coyote was sure he would win. As Coyote was beginning to tire, Frog's look-alike friend jumped onto the course from behind an alder tree ahead. Coyote was surprised to see what he thought was Frog, and ran even faster, determined to win. Coyote dashed past him and called, ""You may be fast, but I'm faster, I'll wait at the finish line to eat you up, Frog!"" When Coyote came in sight of the finish line, Frog had appeared from his hiding place and easily hopped across the line. ""You may be fast, Coyote, but I've managed to beat you!"" Frog joyfully called out. Silently, he added, ""With the help of my friends."" Coyote went home puzzled and hungry again."	['it is better to be clever than strong']

Hong Kong_.	The Ring of Fire covers 4,000 km around the edge of the Pacific Ocean.It includes the countries of Japan,Indonesia and the Philippines.More earthquakes and volcanoes occur in this area than anywhere else in the world.The name Ring of Fire refers to areas below the earth's surface.These areas move suddenly and often cause earthquakes and create volcanoes. Many areas of Asia,such as the Philippines,Japan,and Indonesia, sometime experience earthquakes and volcanoes.There are occasionally landslides ,mudslides,and tidal waves as a result.Fortunately, these natural disasters do not happen very often. Southern China is about 600 km away from the Ring of Fire.Sometimes, people in this region feel earthquakes too.The worst earthquake felt in southern China was in 1918 in Shantou.It measured 7.3 on the Richter scale.Any earthquake of 6 or more on the Richter scale is very dangerous to people. People in Hong Kong sometimes experience the effects of earthquakes and volcanoes.In September 1994,for example,the strongest earthquake to hit Hong Kong for 76 years shook buildings and scared thousands of residents.Frightened workers and families ran out of their offices and homes.The earthquake measured 6.5 on the Richter seal. It is difficult to predict when an earthquake will occur In countries within the Ring of Fire, buildings must be very strong because the effects of earthquakes on buildings are terrible. In June 1991, Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted.Many people were killed and the area surrounding the volcano was badly damaged.Hot ash and liquid rock from the volcano forced people to leave the area.They only returned many months later.The ash spread over a large area.Even people in the Guangdong region of southern China saw ash in the air.

This passage mainly talks about _ .	"Teahouses in Chengdu There is a saying, ""China has the best teahouses in the world and Chengdu has the best teahouses in China.""Chengdu has not only many teahouses but also the special ways of serving and drinking tea. As soon as the visitors enter the teahouses, the waiters or waitresses will greet them with teapots and cups in their hands. The cups often have special covers and saucers . The covers can keep the water warm. People who go to the teahouses are not all thirsty. Retired people pay a little money to the teahouses and then sit there all day long to chat with others. Sometimes, people have parties in the teahouses. They eat fruit and sunflower seeds while they chat and return home when they are tired. Teahouses are also good places for people to talk about businesses. Some of the teahouses even have stages for performances, such as storytelling, cross talk and Sichuan Opera. Sometimes when people have a quarrel, a mediator will bring them to the teahouse. After their problem is solved, the person who is wrong will pay for the tea. It is interesting that as soon as the quarrelers enter the teahouse and sit down to drink tea, they have almost calmed down. With the help of the mediator, their problems can be easily solved then. Maybe we can say the teahouses have some special social functions."	['the special functions of the teahouses']
What can we learn from the passage?	The Round Bird is not like any other birds. He has a big round body but with little wings. He can not fly but he expects to play with other birds in the sky. Every day and in many ways, he tries to fly. And he tries again and again. But nothing works. Then he thinks it will be better use the tree. It is very hard for a little bird to do so, but he climbs up the tree! The Round Bird really wants to learn to fly. A few minutes later, he sits on a branch and gets ready to jump and flap his wings. He practices many times and flap some more, but they don't work! In the end, he climbs down the tree and starts thinking seriously. After thinking for a long time, he knows that although he really wants to fly and tries hard, there are some birds are not able to do. He can't fly because of his body and his little wings. But he knows that there are still some things he is able to. Then the only job for the Round Bird is to find those special things that only special birds like him can do.

Being sad is good for the following except _ .	"Are you in a bad mood? Don't worry! According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory. The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.""People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,""said Forgas For the study, Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments. During the experiments, they made the participants feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past. In one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true. People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw. The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful."

Which would be the best title for the passage?	"My 16-year-old son, Anton, had gone to the local swimming hole. Most of the kids who swim there are fit and strong teens, and there are plenty of rocks for them to use as safe harbors, so I had no fears for his well-being. Still, the firefighter's first words, ""You need to come up here to the Stillwater River,"" made me catch my breath. When I got to the river, I saw Anton sitting quietly on a low platform of the fire engine, with a towel wrapped about his shoulders. I hurried over to him. ""You OK?"" I asked. ""Yeah,"" was all he said. But my eyes begged for an explanation. I didn't get it from my son. The story was this: A couple in their 20s, unfamiliar with the Stillwater, had gotten caught in the current and began screaming for help. Without hesitation Anton and his friend dived into the water, swam out to the drowning woman, and brought her safely to shore. In an age in which the world ""hero"" is broadcast with abandon and seemingly applied to anyone, I realized the real thing in my son and his friend--the disregarding of personal safety for the sake of another human being. I know that teens are headstrong and self-centered, but this didn't lower the gravity of the event and the desire to do good. Along the way home I tried to get some more information from him, but the only words were, ""What's for supper?"" I thought twice about the tragedy that might have been. Questions flew across my mind like a flight of swallows: Would I have risked my life to save a drowning person? Or would I have chosen to dial 911? Would I have told the story over and over to anyone who'd listen? The next morning, when Anton got up, I half expected him to tell me the story from his point of view, now that he had some distance from the event. But all he did was to toast a pie, pull himself together, and head for the door to begin the new day."	['My Son, My Hero']

How many people on average will compete for one post provided by the secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPC this year?	"The huge thirst for jobs in the civil service has made the national civil servant exam one of China's most competitive tests. The first exam was held in 1995, and since then more and more people have signed up for it, with applications reaching a peak over the last two years. The latest online survey, carried out by China Youth Daily and www.qq.com, found that more than 73 percent of young people want to work as civil servants. Of the 17,330 respondents, about 83 percent said they were attracted by the job's stability, guaranteed health care and pension . Meanwhile, 55 percent said it could bring ""practical profits"". Nearly 1 million people applied to take the exam last year, yet only just over 10,000 were finally employed. This year the competition continued. The exact number of applicants is not known, with the final day for applications today. But the flood of applicants has already broken the exam's website once. China Youth Daily reported that the site was forced to close for _ due to unusually high traffic on the night of October 16, which has never happened in the past. In a typical year several hundred applicants will apply for many of the jobs listed. For example, the five job vacancies provided by the secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPC have attracted more than 3,880 applicants this year. Positions as civil servants are attractive, not only because of the stable income and good health care, but also because of the low risks compared with the power and resources the positions enjoy. Among the total 6 million public servants, around 20,000 were dismissed between 1996 and 2007."	['776.']

How does the overuse of cell phones affect teenagers?	"Teenagers spend too much time using their cell phones and being connected online these days! Is this a new way to be more social or, does the technology really make them unsocial? And how will this constant connection affect them? My daughter who is fifteen years old has a smart cell phone which means that she is constantly connected to the Internet and of course Facebook. To be around her means that you have to listen to constant ""beeps"" and sounds from the cell phone when her friends update their status. It makes me really stressed. But that is me. For my daughter, the cell phone is an extension to her body. She sleeps with her cell phone on the pillow; she eats with her cell phone nearby; She even takes the cell phone to the bathroom. For the generation who has grown up with the Internet and cell phones, it is important for them to stay close to their cell phones. They get stressed when they are disconnected! And most of them haven't experienced a life without cell phones. For them, being offline or not having a cell phone is like being totally isolated . And when they get online after a long disconnection they are so stressed out, because they have so much catching-up to do! So how is this constant connection affecting the new generation who has been born with the opportunity to stay connected to the Internet all the time? I see them as guinea pigs ! Because nobody knows how _ will affect humans in the long run. No research has been done yet on long-term side effects of being constantly reachable and connected to others. My conclusion is that teenagers' addiction to cell phones makes them both social and unsocial. The new technology has changed the way they connect with people compared to former generations. They are more social and can be mobile but this also forces them to do more than one job at a time which distracts their attention and prevents them from focusing on the present, which makes them unsociable. No one knows how this use will affect humans. We will just have to wait and see."	['It forces teenagers to do several things at the same time.']
People plant the GM plants because _	Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them.

The school project is intended to _ .	"It was 1963, in Paris. While walking through the fruit and vegetable market Alice Waters was struck by the display of brilliant color1s, the music of farmers selling their produce, and in the middle of a great city. She felt ""directly connected to the land."" Chez Panisse, a Berkeley restaurant, which was founded upon Waters' ecological philosophy, has been named ""The Best Restaurant in America"" by both the James Beard Foundation and by Gourmet magazine, many times in the past. Only the food grown in accordance with the principles of sustainable agriculture was used in the restaurant. Menus offered nightly at Chez Panisse have consisted only of fresh ingredients, harvested in season, and purchased from local farmers. Alice Waters has successfully demonstrated how a restaurant can develop successfully while contributing to the general welfare of the farming community. Sharing a meal between the people was one of the wishes of Alice Waters as she would love her customers to know each other. In 1996, inspired by the Garden Project at the San Francisco County Jail , Waters decided to apply her principles to education. The project was first started at the Martin Luther King Middle School in Berkeley with the idea to transform some land near the school into a garden and, in the process, to teach local school children about food and agriculture. In 1999, over 120 people came to help plant the first cover crop, which prepared the field for farming by adding nutrients to the soil. The student garden staff has had several years' worth of harvest, and has started growing gardens like herb and tea. Here, agricultural practices are continually being revised and updated and every year the Schoolyard staff attends the Ecological Farming Conference in Monterey. A kitchen classroom has also been created, where students learn about main foods eaten in other parts of the world. ""I believe that every child in this world needs to have a relationship with the land...to know how to nourish themselves...and to know how to connect with the community around them,"" says Waters. The middle school has become a model in itself. The students work the land and harvest the crops, while the cafeteria buys and prepares the produce for school lunches. This program will go a long way in teaching kids to value fresh food and their own contributions. This project is sure to inspire a national change in school curricula . In fact, many middle and high schools in California and Ohio have launched similar projects. In 1997, Alice Waters received the Humanitarian Award from the James Beard Foundation in recognition of her dedication and contribution towards environment. In 1999, the U.S. Department of Education Secretary, Richard Riley, honored her with a John H. Stanford ""Education Hero"" award."	['teach students agricultural knowledge']
The writer still remember the story many years later _ .	"Many years ago, when I was working as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Lisa. The poor little girl had a very serious disease and was dying. The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies to fight the illness. The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa."" As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid. He looked up at the doctor and asked, "" Will I start to die now?"" He was too young to understand the doctor. He thought he would have to give all his blood to his sister, but he agreed."	['because of what the boy did for his sister']
What does the writer say is the general view about health care?	"Our risk of cancer rises rapidly as we age. So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors or doesn't it? While such tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing. In many cases, screening can lead to additional examinations and operations to remove cancer, which can cause side effects, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not cause serious health problems in patients' remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so ingrained that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a noisy reaction among doctors, patients and social groups. It's hard to uproot deeply-held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or previous personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the rest, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy. A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening--especially considering the explosion of the elderly. It's not an easy calculation to make, but one that makes sense for patients. Dr. Otis Brawley said, ""Many doctors are ordering these tests purely to cover themselves from medical disputes. We need to think about the wise use of health care, which means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better."""

What would be the best title for the passage?	"Nathan Sawaya's childhood was a lot of fun. He drew cartoons, wrote stories, and played with plastic toy bricks . His grandparents bought his first set of toy bricks when he was five years old and he's been building with toy bricks ever since. He even took his building bricks to college with him! Instead of books and a computer, he had a model of Greenwich Village made of bricks on his desk. Nathan started as a lawyer but gave up His highly-paid job to become an artist that uses toys in his art. He uses toy bricks to build everything from the Statue of Liberty to Superman! He has more than 1.5 million colored bricks in his working room in New York which he uses to make pieces of art. He started by building small models but then decided to do something big and created a self-portrait . It took him two days just to build the eyes. Nathan's work has appeared in museums around the world. Children love his art because it is made out of the same toys that they play with at home and adults love his work because it is fascinating. Since it began in2007, Nathan's exhibition ""The Art of the Brick"" has been very popular with museum visitors everywhere. ""I'm proud that I took a dream I had as a child, to become an artist, and I have actually made a job out of it,"" says Nathan. ""To do what you love in life is the most important thing."""

As a volunteer at hospital, you should _ .	I went to a volunteer orientation at Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital in California several days ago. Before I went there, I thought it was just a meeting for us to learn some basic information on how to do volunteer work. To my surprise, this meeting lasted for four hours! It told us in detail how to be a good volunteer at hospital. For example, Graham, the director, told us to keep eye contact while offering help and never wait to be asked but offer help first. She also told us to bend down to listen while patients are talking to show that we're willing to hear. We should lead them to ask others for help if we can't answer their questions and never say: it is not my business. For the whole meeting, Miss Graham taught us how to satisfy patients through our words, body language and manners. It impressed me a lot. Americans pay so much attention to serving people with a professional attitude . I suddenly realized why many people feel foreigners are really nice and friendly. They have been trained to do so since they were young. They always ask themselves: How do people feel toward my service? How can I improve to let them feel better? I really like this kind of culture.

What does the author intend to tell us in the passage?	October 15th is Global Handwashing Day.Activities are planned in more than twenty countries to get millions of people in the developing world to wash their hands with soap. Experts say people around the world wash their hands but very few use soap at so-called critical moments.These include after using the toilet, after cleaning a baby and before touching food. Global Handwashing Day is the idea of the Public-private Partnership for handwashing with soap.The goal, they say, is to create a culture of handwashing with soap.The organizers say all soaps are equally effective at removing disease-causing germs.They say the correct way to wash is to wet your hands with a small amount of water and cover them with soap.Rub it into all areas, including under the fingernails.Then, wash well under running water.Finally, dry your hands with a clean cloth. The Partnership says soap is important because it increases the time that people spend washing.Soap also helps to break up the dirt that holds most of the germs.And it usually leaves a pleasant smell, which increases the chances that people will wash again. It also says that washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet could save more lives than any medicine.It could help reduce cases of diarrhea, which is the second leading cause of child deaths, killing more than one and a half million children a year, by almost half.

After the author made the phone call, _ .	"When I was growing up in America, I was ashamed of my mother's Chinese English. Because of her English, she was often treated unfairly. People in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously ,did not give her good service ,pretended not to understand her ,or even acted as if they did not hear her .W _ w w.k*s*5 u.c@o m My mother has realized the limitations of her English as well. When I was fifteen, she used to have me call people on phone to pretend I was she . I was forced to ask for information or even to yell at people who had been rude to her. One time I had to call her stockbroker .I said in an adolescent voice that was not very convincing, ""This is Mrs.Tan.."" And my mother was standing beside me ,whispering loudly, ""Why he don't send me cheek already two week late."" And then , in perfect English I said : ""I'm getting rather concerned .You agreed to send the check two weeks ago, but it hasn't arrived."" Then she talked more loudly. ""What he want? I come to New York tell him front of his boss."" And so I turned to the stockbroker again, ""I can't tolerate any more excuse. If I don't receive the check immediately , I am going to have to speak to your manager when I am in New York next week."" The next week we ended up in New York. While I was sitting there red-faced, my mother, the real Mrs.Tan, was shouting to his boss in her broken English. When I was a teenager, my mother's broken English embarrassed me. But now, I see it differently. To me, my mother's English is perfectly clear, perfectly natural. It is my mother tongue. Her language, as I hear it, is vivid, direct, and full of observation and wisdom. It was the language that helped shape the way I saw things, expressed ideas, and made sense of the world."

Who caused the cash machine not to work properly?	"Scores of people queued up to use a cash machine after it started giving out double the money requested. The cash machine, outside a Sainsbury's store in Barham Road, Hull, attracted a big crowd of people hoping to take advantage of the fault, on Tuesday night. Police officers were eventually sent in to guard the machine and prevent anymore money from being withdrawn. The fault is thought to have affected cash machines at supermarkets across the city. It is not yet known whether the customers will have to repay the cash or how much money was taken out. A spokeswoman for Humberside Police said, ""Officers were sent to the cash machine to prevent anyone else from withdrawing anymore money. We have also tried to make contact with the owners of the machine."" The spokeswoman said those who benefited from the fault could be traced and could face theft charges, but investigations would only take place if the operator made a complaint. The cash machine is owned by a company called Payzone, a spokesman later confirmed. He said the fault was due to the machine being filled with notes of the wrong denomination . An investigation is underway into the incident and the machine had been taken out of service, he added. The Payzone spokesman said, ""The transit company which is contracted to service this ATM has filled it up with the wrong denomination of notes, meaning it is paying out double what it should have. "" He could not say how much money had been taken out of the machine, or whether it would have to be paid back. It was understood that a number of cash machines in Hull owned by other companies had also been affected by this problem, he added."	['The transit company.']

The author believes one effective way to fight global warming is _ .	Recently,scientists attending a meeting in Chicago presented new studies showing how food and its production affect global warming.They offered some suggestions for how to eat in a more environmentally friendly way. For many years,scientists have warned us that our planet is getting warmer.If current trends continue,animals may start to die off and life could get very difficult for everyone.The temperature is rising because humans have been releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,which surround the planet and keep heat from escaping.One of these gases is carbon dioxide. Most carbon dioxide we produce comes from the process of making and eating food,the scientists reported in Chicago.The production of meat contributes to a lot of carbon dioxide.And much of meat's contribution comes from beef,which is responsible for releasing even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The process of making a hamburger,for example,requires a lot of energy.A cow has to be fed and raised,and cow's wastes are a major source of greenhouse gases.After the cow is killed,the meat has to be processed and shipped to a consumer,which takes fuel.And most of the cow won't even be used for meat people eat. By the time a hamburger finally lands on a dinner plate,it has taken a heavy toll on the environment.It is believed that the process of making a halfpound allbeef burger adds about 19 times the weight of hamburgers in carbon dioxide. The message is clear:We can greatly reduce the production of greenhouse gases by eating less beef.Other kinds of meat like pork and chicken do less harm to the environment--at least in terms of the amount of greenhouse gases released.Nathan Pelletier,a scientist at Dalhousie University in Canada,reported that if everyone in industrial countries ate chicken instead of beef,we would cut the Earth's greenhouse gases by more than half. All kinds of meat,the scientists reported,are harder on the planet than vegetables.To grow and eat a pound of potatoes,for example,sends less than one quarter pound of carbon dioxide into the air.So shifting our diet to less meat and more vegetables may do the world some good.	['we should eat less meat and more vegetables']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	"If you dream of going to someplace warm to escape the cold winter weather, a trip to a recently discovered planet would certainly warm you right up. The planet, named OCLE-TR-56b, has temperatures of more than 3,000 degF. ""This is the hottest planet we know about,"" says Dr. Dimitar Sasselov, a scientist who led the discovery team, ""It is hot enough to have an iron fog and to rain hot iron droplets "" The new planet is 30 times farther away than any planet discovered by scientists before. It is in the Milky Way but it is not in our solar system The new planet moves around a star much like our sun, however. Scientists discovered the planet by using a new planet-searching method, called""transit technique"" They were able to catch sight of the planet when it moved in front of its star, causing the star's light to dim .Scientists compare the method to discovering the shadow of a bee flying in front of a searchlight 200 miles away. ""We believe the door has been opened wide to go and discover planets like Earth,"" says Sasedlov."	['the star could block our view of the new planet']
Performing drama is likely to help children _ .	"Drama and the performing arts are excellent methods of building confidence in children and adults alike. Learning through drama allows children to explore their creativity and have fun while leaving their shyness and worries behind. Drama also works by supporting the growth of imagination and other skills. Entertainmet has become rather passive with cinema, television, and computer games becoming more popular. These screen-based methods have had a negative effect on communication. However, drama puts the "" _ "" back into entertainment. Children have the opportunity to connect with others in a more meaningful way as drama encourages speech development and awareness of body language, and allows the child to become more socially aware. Play and drama are closely linked. When children play a game, they are pretending and using their imagination and so are moving away from reality to create their own story. Drama is a vehicle through which children can express themselves more freely through mime , gesture, movement, and speech to make education fun. Children gain confidence by understanding that there is no final answer in drama and that their opinion and contribution are valued. Children are able to give a personal response to many issues and situations such as poverty, bullying , global warming and recycling. The issues that drama can deal with are endless. Drama and education have a strong link as drama can encourage children to take an active interest in other subjects such as geography, history, and English and so have a more rounded education. As a drama teacher, I have witnessed children at their first class holding onto their parent's arm-unwilling to let go. Then to see the same child later running ino my class with smile is an excellent sight. Drama installs confidence in children by allowing them to improvise and experiment. Everyone is given the opportunity to shine within drama."	['become more confident in themselves']

What do the older generation and the younger one think about money?	"My father' s response to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: ""You won' t catch me putting my money in there!"" he declared, ""Not in that glass box. "" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I believe that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Therefore, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to make sure of the fact, however, untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building' s design made it appear strong, the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol showed the general attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Except pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable factor is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture is proud of imaginative powers."	['To the former money is a real commodity but to the latter it is a means to produce more money.']
According to the passage, we can know that _	One of the biggest accomplishments in sports in the last hundred years was the 4-minute mile. Running a mile in under 4 minutes was a huge barrier in sports. Once it was broken by one person, lots of athletes tried to break it too. For years, people thought that running a mile in less than 4 minutes was just _ impossible. It was common knowledge that nobody on earth could physically run a mile in under 4 minutes. Professional runners had been trying for years, training to beat that time, but had failed every time. In 1952, a British man by the name of Roger Bannister set a goal for himself: to be the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes. He trained intensely, and 2 years later, Bannister finally broke 4-minute barrier. And you know what? Soon after that, more and more people began to run the mile in under 4 minutes. New world records were set almost every year following Bannister's sub-4-minute-mile. Nowadays, even a high school student can reasonably run a 4-minute mile. In about 50 years, the 4-minute mile went from impossible to professional to amateur. But I guess I'm not really answering the question here: what on earth does this have to do with learning Japanese? When you have a goal in mind, mental barriers can be huge obstacles to overcome, and learning Japanese is no different. But if you're devoted enough and make your goal your top priority , you might be surprised at what you can do. Put everything else aside for a while, just go for it and see what you can achieve. After all, if somebody can accomplish something that people thought was physically impossible, then maybe learning Japanese isn't so hard after all.	['mental barriers are the biggest ones when achieving goals']
What can we learn from the text?	"A busy public square in the Chinese city of Nanjing is home to an unusual experiment. For almost two months, the country's first ""honesty bookshop"" has occupied a sidewalk on HanZhong Road in the city's Gulou District. With no cashier or other staff, the store relies on trust for payment. Making money isn't the company's main goal and they don't punish those who take books without paying. ""If they can really finish the books, it doesn't matter if they took the books for free,"" Zhu Yu, the marketing director of the company says. ""In fact, we are really happy to witness so many people taking books from the honesty bookshop."" After browsing the four wooden bookshelves, customers must drop their money in a locked box. Prices are set at 30% of the usual cover price. Zhu hopes that his sidewalk store, which sells, on average, 60 books a day, will make more people interested in reading. Like elsewhere, e-books are affecting sales of traditional books, and traditional books and many independent booksellers are struggling. Zhu got permission from the city government to use the sidewalk and says he's determined to make it a long-term project. He says the store is open every day, except when it rains, and it's locked up each night. In September last year, the company laid out 1,000 books and reading lamps on the ground and encouraged people ""to go on a date"" with a book. ""Independent bookshops represent the well-being of the city."" Zhu told CNN in 2013, ""when a city is losing its bookshops, it's actually losing something in its soul."" If the success of the Honesty Bookstore is any guide, Nanjing's soul is in pretty good shape."	['30% of the normal cover price is charged for each book.']
According lothe passage,what can defend the parents' child rearing?	"What is the main testing ground of fears about incomplete or inadequate child reariry? The college admission process. If you are afraid you don't discipline your children enough,the evidence of parental failure is right there in front of everyone. The child is not filling out her college applications ! lf you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades,you will have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is,from my perspective,a cover for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have seen manv parents,dive back into their children's lives at college admission time, trying to fill all of their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to be sure as their children leave the nest that they reall} have taught them how to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this point,the next best thing is the status of the colege to which the child is admitted. From the point of an anxious parent,an ""Ivy l,eague college"" child is proof of better child rearing than a ""small college"" child. I once sat with a talented,weak senior girl and her brilliant parents. She,they,and the school had to decide whether she should remam m school or go into a hospital. In light of her anorexia( ) ,the school recommended strongly that she not file her early application to Princeton. Upon hearing this,the girl looked at the adults in the room and said,""If I can't apply early to Princeton,l'll die. "" Her parents were also eager to have her get into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because,in this case,something was wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in her upbringing,this child was not happy or self-confident. Yet she was eighteen,the culture required her to leave home. The psychological solution for them all was the comforting vision of a great college. Somehow going there would make her life fine and defend her parents' child rearing. Such fears about letting go of an unfmished child exist in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope. For parents looking for a painkiller,the college admission process is where they can work out their anxieties."	['A great college.']
The best title for the passage is _ .	A good way to pass an exam is to work hard every day in a year. You may fail in an exam if you are lazy for most of the year and then work hard only a few days before the exam. If you want to be good at English, you have to read stories in English, and to speak English as much as possible. A few days before the exam you should go to bed early. Do not go to bed late at night studying. Before you start answering in the exam, read carefully over the question papers, and try to understand the meaning of each question. When you have finished your exam, read over your answers. Correct the mistakes if there are any and be sure that you don't miss anything out. A. B.C.D,. (5,2,10)	['How to Pass an Exam']
What can we infer from the passage?	"Do you blank out or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety. But, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it. Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases the hormone adrenaline , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence. Important of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: ""I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can."" Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities. Last but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control."	['A touch of anxiety can have a positive effect.']
How was the writer's first trip to India?	"On my first visit to India with my friend, Barry, we met a really nice woman on the plane. Her name was Uma. Talking with her made us very happy. When we arrived in India, we found that our bags weren't on our plane. It was 4 am on Saturday morning. But we were told that we couldn't get our bags until Monday. What could we do? As we stood there thinking, Uma came over. She said, ""Our car will come soon. Come home with me."" We went out of the airport and got into the small car. It was already crowded with Uma's family who had come to welcome her home. At the house, we showered and rested. They provided us with delicious Indian meals and took us on tours of their city. On Monday morning, their driver took us to the airport, where we were happy to get our bags. The following year, we returned to India, and our first thing was to visit Uma and her family. We have become good friends. Her kindness was a real gift. Everywhere we went, we met kind Indian people. We also did our best to pass on that kindness wherever we went, just as Uma did."	['Nice.']
What did the doctor first ask the woman?	"A woman was having some trouble with her heart, so she went to see a doctor. He was a new doctor, and did not know her, so he first asked some questions about her, and one of them was, ""How old are you?"" ""Well,"" she said, ""I don't remember, doctor, but I will try to think."" She thought for a moment and said, ""Yes, I remember now, doctor! When I married , I was eighteen years old, and my husband was thirty. Now my husband is sixty, I know, and that is twice thirty. So I am twice eighteen. I think I am thirty-six,is it right?"""

What is the main idea of this article?	"We always want to prepare ourselves to the changes we may face when we go to a different country. Well, I have to say that for me, even after living in the US for one year and a half, I am still not used to the changes of weather, or how to manage my money well. There are many things that can give us culture shocks, but it is up to us whether to make it a big shock or a small one. I know that changing schools was a big thing for me. It helped me to be stronger and open towards meeting new people. Sometimes it feels like everybody is already in a group. This makes it harder for someone else to go in. But, it is not that hard. Actually many people know that you are from another country. They feel curious about your ""history"", and would often think you are a different man. Another thing that can produce a shock to me is the sudden change of weather. During the last couple of days, there was an ice-snow storm. It was the biggest in 15 years in the state of Missouri. It was raining ice, really, and you could hear sounds outside the window like little pieces of rocks hitting it, of course it was the ice. It started _ so heavily that the University had to close down for two days, and it got worse when it started snowing after the ice storm. As international students, you may at times find something very difficult, but hey, anyone can beat and overcome it to make studying aboard an unforgettable experience."

Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"Consumer electronics once again topped the list of the most wanted gifts this holiday season. ""Seventy-six percent of consumers who plan to buy holiday gifts say that they will spend money or buy at least one technology product; definitely a solid vote of confidence for technology.""

This makes it easy for users to email or upload photographs directly from the camera. ""You can literally take a picture and upload it into your Facebook in a matter of seconds.

The newest ones work with any device that has Bluetooth technology, including smart phones, laptops and tablets."	['Most people would like to buy electronics as gifts.']
According to the passage, it can be inferred that _	"""Walt Disney World is banning selfie-sticks from its theme parks because selfie-sticks have become a growing safety concern for both our guests and cast."" Disney World spokeswoman Kim Prunty said. Under a new policy, which takes effect Tuesday, the poles won't make it past the bag check at any Disney World theme park. The sticks also won't be allowed in Disney World water parks or Disney Quest, a gaming attraction at Downtown Disney. Selfie-sticks will also become forbidden at Disneyland Resort in California on June 30. The prohibition begins at Disney's parks in Paris and Hong Kong on July 1. Guests will be checked for the equipment during the routine bag check that happens near the parks' entrances. They will have an option of turning in their selfie-sticks for pick-up later or to go back to their cars or hotel rooms to keep them. Visitors will be told of the policy in locations such as the parking lots and at the resort's hotels. The prohibition will be added to the park rules post on Disney World's website. The issue has been building at Disney. Previously, the sticks were prohibited from its rides, and ""no selfie-sticks"" signs were at select rides, such as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at Magic Kingdom. Cast members have given oral warnings to rule breakers. Selfie-stick users put smartphones and cameras on the ends of poles to extend their reach, frequently capturing theme-park moments through self-portraits. The tools have been banned in public places - including some museums and stadiums - worldwide for _ views or causing safety issues. Disney World already prohibits items such as skateboards, inline skates, wagon, folding chairs and glass containers, according to its official website, which also lists ""other items that we determine may be harmful."" Universal Orlando has banned selfie-sticks and other loose items from certain thrill rides at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure theme parks, but it has not set parkwide bans."

The secret of language is that _ .	"Can you remember the day when you spoke your first words? If you can, you are unusual. Try to think what the first months of your life were like. I'm sure you just spent most of your time eating, sleeping and crying. As you grew older, your parents spent more time playing with you and talking to you. You watched and listened. You began to know that people make some sounds to go with some things. Then you began to cry to make sounds you heard. And step by step you were able to make the right sound for one thing. On that day you came to understand the secret of the language. The secret is that a certain sound means a certain thing. Only when a group of people use the same set of sounds of things can they understand each other, so these people have a language. After you found the secret of language, you learnt words. Some of the words mean things, like books, chairs and shops. Some of the words mean _ , for example, go and swim. Soon you learnt to put words together to share your idea, like ""I want to go out and play with my friends."" This is language. By the way of language, people can communicate .

What do expert think Eyjafjallajokull is like now?	"Experts say the temperature in Eyjafjallajokull's hole appears to have fallen to 100C, meaning it is now producing steam, not magma . But officials warned that it was too early to say whether the eruption was over completely. Ash clouds from the volcano grounded thousands of flights last month. Steinunn Jakobsdottir, a geophysicist from the Icelandic Meteorological Office, told the BBC that the volcano was ""kind of not active for the moment"". ""The history of the volcano is such that it calms down and then it gets energy again,"" she said. ""There are still earthquakes under the volcano, and the small earthquake is still not quite down to what it was before the eruption."" 'Difficult to say' Magnus Gudmundsson, of Iceland University, flew over the volcano on Sunday and said information from heat cameras showed the temperatures at the crater had fallen below 100C. But he told the AFP news agency that nothing was promised and that the previous eruption at the volcano had lasted 13 months, from 1821-23. ""It stopped and started again several times with different intervals , so it's difficult to say, difficult to give a timeline,"" he said. He also said it was impossible to say whether the neighbouring Katla volcano - a much larger mountain - might also erupt. At the height of its activity, the volcano sent out huge clouds of ash, which led to airlines grounding their planes for fear it could _ plane engines. It was the biggest action of closing airspace in Europe since World War II, and affected at least 10 million passengers worldwide."	['The hole appears about 100 degrees C']

What can be the best title for the passage?	"Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of ""studio schools"" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs. Under plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms. Each teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school ""line manager"". The reforms are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place. The Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19. The government said all subjects would be taught ""through projects, often prepared with employers"" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications connected directly to the needs of local employers."	"[""Studio schools are built to improve teens' employability skills.""]"

What does the writer expect family life to be like?	"In a few years, most people will know that a healthy, happy, loving family is a joy and it is a necessary part for building a strong society. But there are still some people who don't believe family life can be an enjoyable experience. Some people already accepted the idea of the ""me generation"" so they fail to understand that there is a time in life when they have to give up their time to something more valuable. At a time when adults need to think about the needs of their family, they will be doing other important things. Some people will spend too much time working for a more powerful car or a bigger house so that they can proudly say that they have them. Some will be doing dangerous things so that they may tell their stories to their friends, and others will recite things like "" I must become the best I can be."" or ""I don't want to be at the bottom."" The needs of their family will be forgotten and they never seem to have time for the family. Many people have not experienced a strong helpful perfect family life, so they have never discovered its worth. Many people have always experienced family life as a flight, so they can't find time and energy for work. But it is really very important that we all expect good family relations. We need to realize and value the importance of what can be achieved by loving each other in the family. It is also important for our society to encourage family members to create happiness."

According to the writer, in an aptitude test, Chinese job applicants should _ .	"The interview has been going on for about 20 minutes and everything seems to be going well.Then, suddenly, the interviewer asks an unexpected question, ""Which is more important, law or love?"" Job applicants in the West increasingly find themselves asked strange questions like this.And the signs are that this is beginning to happen in China. Employers want people who are skilled, enthusiastic and devoted.So these are the qualities that any reasonably intelligent job applicant will try to show no matter what his or her actual feelings are.In response, employers are increasingly using the questions which try and show the applicant's true personality. The question in the first paragraph comes from a test called the Kiersey Temperament Sorter.It is an attempt to discover how people solve problems, rather than what they know.This is often called aptitude test. According to Mark Baldwin of Alliance, many job applicants in China are finding this type of questions difficult.""When a Chinese fills out an aptitude test, he or she will think there is a right answer but they may fail because they try to guess what the examiner wants to see."" This is sometimes called the prisoner's dilemma .Applicants are trying to act cleverly in their own interest, but they fail because they don't understand what the interviewer is looking for.Remember that in an aptitude test, the correct answer is the honest answer."

According to the passage, the risk of exposing personal information may possibly be caused by _ .	"Every year, millions of Americans see their personal information leak into the wrong hands. Maybe there's spyware on the their computer, or a service they use suffered a security reach, leaving customers at the risk of exposure. Or perhaps their password is easy to guess. Don't fear: You can easily set up proper defenses. Here's how. * Clean Your Computer and Smartphone Before you put new security measures into place, make sure your devices are as spotless as possible. This means installing a good antivirus program and taking the time to clear out any spy -- or malware that may have already infected your system. These days, it's also worth it to make sure your phone is safe from viruses. Iphones are less likely to be targeted by spyware, but Android users should download the Lookout app to scan their devices and ensure everything is as it should be. * Secure Your WiFi. It's fairly easy for potential criminals to gain access to your information if they're able to share your connection -- that's why you want to be careful when using public WiFi. Even though you put security measures into place a couple of years ago, it's a good idea to refresh your settings. * Use passwords What you've heard is true: Passwords should use a variety of special characters, numerals, letters, and cases when possible. * Check the shopping security Take care when shopping online. Always check the security symbols when using an online site for shopping. If the lock icon encryption is not there, do not give out credit details. Also, check that the site is legal -- never go to a site from a random email and start shopping online. Keep a separate credit card just for online shopping. This will make it easier to cancel if something bad does happen and your other credit card for ""in real life"" can still be used uninfluenced. Don't store information on any store's website. It may be convenient but it's also a possible loss to you if the site is hacked."	['the practice of using public WiFi']
Wilbur is the character of the book _ .	Winnie-the-Pooh By A. A. Milne Winnie-the-Pooh has been introduced and reintroduced to generation after generation as a model of a child's best friend. However, not everyone has found Pooh is lovely. This classic has been banned in a variety of countries at one point. So why would anyone ever want to keep children from the joy of Milne's classic? In the case of Russia, Winnie-the-Pooh was banned in 2009 because of alleged Nazi ties. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz By Frank Baum Originally published in the year 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the foundations of the fairytale genre. Who, then, would seek to ban a book that has become so important to the American experience? America is that who. The Detroit Library banned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1957 for having no value for children. Charlotte's Web By E. B. White White's tale of the relationship between two unexpected creatures, a spider and a pig, has been drawing children in for over half a century. Published in 1952, this classic has been readily available on most library shelves for children to read. However, some people would like to make this book never see the light of day. In one extreme case, a school in England banned Charlotte's Web for fear that the pig Wilbur might be offensive to Muslim students. Fortunately, the Muslim Council of Britain saw the foolishness of this ban, so the book was quickly restored to its right place on the shelves. Where the Wild Things Are By Maurice Sendak Though its first copy was published fifty years ago, this book hasn't always been readily available in libraries and in stores. After its release, Where the Wild Things Are was banned in libraries all across the U.S. for its dark tone and unruly leading characters. Nowadays, you'll find far fewer libraries that still hold this ban.	"[""Charlotte's Web.""]"

It was very popular. One of their hit records was Never Say Goodbye. Michael was good at dancing as well as singing, for example, his dance moves and moon walking. He was asked to act in a film in 1978 for the first time, and in the same year he made a record on his own, which was sold eight million _ all over the world. Michael nearly didn't go out because he was too famous. Once his fans went off in a faint when they saw him at the concert. No one can do it by now. He lived in a large house and kept lots of animals. He never ate meat. He often raised money for charity. This made him win the Guinness world Records in 2006. He died on June 25th, 2009, but he would live in our hearts forever."	['moon walking']
How did the writer feel after the visit?	"I went to Arizona earlier this month to see what the college of the future might look like. What I found is an exciting new era of higher education that will help more students get a great, personalized education at an affordable price. This future may not always include the lecture halls, dormitories, and other features of the traditional college experience. Instead, the colleges I visited are experimenting with ways for students to get their degrees online, allowing them to take courses any place and at any time. These "" _ ,"" as they are sometimes called, are at the forefront of the effort to broaden access to higher education, especially for low-income students with full-time jobs and families. During my visit, I heard encouraging stories of students who were taking advantage of these flexible learning models to pursue degrees that could put them on paths to new careers. One of those students was Shawn Lee. He had a compelling story: After dropping out of college decades ago, he found himself in a series of low-paying, often back-breaking jobs. He recently decided to get his degree when he had his first child and wanted to start building a better life. Tucked away in an industrial park in Tempe, Rio Salado didn't look much like a traditional institute of higher education. There were no students running to class. Just a couple of glass-faced office buildings. The college had just 22 full-time faculty serving 60,000 students, with more than half of them attending classes online. Several students I met during my visit said they liked learning online. ""I've taken college classes in a big auditorium with herds of people. There was no personal connection,"" one student said. ""Now I can reach my teacher with the click of a mouse."" After several days' visit, I left Arizona feeling quite optimistic about what the future holds for higher education."	['Hopeful.']
What's the best title of this passage?	Zheng He was an amazing man. He was born in 1371. Eleven years later, he was caught by the army of a rich young man called Zhu Di and made to work for him. Over time the rich man saw that Zheng He was very clever and strong and they became close friends. In 1403 Zhu Di was made the King of China and he asked Zheng He to join his government. The King wanted to learn more about the world and show other countries his power. He ordered many new ships to be built and made Zheng He their leader. between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He led seven sea trips to different parts of the world. He certainly travelled to India, Africa and the Middle East. A few people think his ships have even reached South America and Australia. Each trip lasted between two and four years and it is believed he sailed more than 50,000 kms during the years of his travels.Zheng He led a fleet with 28,000 men and over 300 ships, such as boats for food, water and even soldiers' horses. On these trips he brought with him many Chinese goods like silk and medicine to give to foreign kings or to sell for local goods. He returned from each trip with boats filled with expensive things such as gold and treasures, foreign guests and strange animals like a giraffe. It is a pity that we may never learn everything about Zheng He' s travels. The Columbus of the east, Zheng He, died in 1433. After that, the new king, had these trips stopped and he burned almost all the books about Zheng He's travels, because he believed the trips were unlucky and too expensive. It is only in the last 50 years that historians have begun to carefully study the adventures of great Zheng He.	['Zheng He, the Columbus of the East']

You can carry all of the following valuables on your person EXCEPT _ .	While traveling, you'll be taking money, license or passport. Or you will buy something expensive to take back home with you and you don't want it to get stolen. Here are some ideas on how to keep your valuables safe while traveling Plan ahead of time Think of what you really need and don't need to take on your trip. Only take the valuables that you must have, not just ones that you would like to have. Carry your valuables on your person Something that is small, like cash and credit cards and your passport, can be carried in a money wallet around your neck or in a money belt. This way, your valuables are hidden and right next to you, where you know where they are at all times. Wear clothing that can hide the money belt. Carry larger valuables in your carry-on bag. If you can't fit it in your money wallet like some large valuables, you'd better put them somewhere that you will keep touch with them. Your can put them on the plane, so you don't have to worry about the airline losing your bag or someone stealing it from the belt after the flight before you get to it. Choose a hotel that has the front desk for valuables. This way, you don't have to worry about housekeeping getting hold of your valuables, or someone stealing your valuables if your room is broken into. If you give the valuables to the front desk to keep for you, choose a time when others are not looking.	['your large valuables']
One of the disadvantages of high speed trains mentioned in this passage is that _ .	"Trains have long been an important form of transportation. Yet they have changed a lot since 1804, when the first train moved at 8 km/hr. Today's high speed trains can go 300 km/hr or faster. Besides their speed, they have many advantages over other transportation types. Japan built the world's first high speed railway. In 1964, Japan's ""Shinkansen"" trains started traveling between Osaka and Tokyo at 200 km/hr. Over time, more lines, as well as faster trains, were built. Korea, England, and the USA, now have their own high speed systems. Taiwan Province's started running in 2007. Its trains are based on two types of Shinkansen trains. They can carry 989 people and travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in less than two hours. These systems are expensive to build, but they have many advantages. For example, they are good for the environment. Trains on the London to Paris line create 1/10 the pollution that planes create. High speed trains are also safer and cleaner than cars. Super fast trains can even help a country's economy . They make it easier to travel to faraway places. That helps businesses and land values in those areas. It's no wonder so many countries are building their own high speed railways."	['it costs a lot to build the whole high speed systems']
What's the passage about?	Healthy eating doesn't just mean what you eat, but how you eat. Here is some advice on healthy eating. Eat with others. It can help you to see others' healthy eating habits. If you usually eat with your parents, you will find that the food you eat is more delicious. Listen to your body. Ask yourself if you are really hungry. Have a glass of water to see if you are thirsty, sometimes you are just thirsty, you need no food. Stop eating before you feel full. Eat breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. After you don't eat for the past ten hours, your body needs food to get you going. You will be smarter after eating breakfast. Eat healthy snacks like fruit, yogurt or cheese. We all need snacks sometimes. In fact, it's a good idea to eat two healthy snacks between your three meals. This doesn't mean that you can eat a bag of chips instead of a meal. Don't eat dinner late. With our busy life, we always put off eating dinner until the last minute. Try to eat dinner at least 3 hours before you go to bed. This will give your body a chance to _ most of the food before you rest for the next 8-10 hours.	['How to eat.']

Henry and his wife held hands _	Have you ever had an embarrassing experience? Last week we asked readers to tell us about embarrassing experiences. We received thousands of letters! Here is a selection. Tony: My most embarrassing experience happened when I had just left university. I had just started teaching in a Liverpool middle school. One morning my alarm clock didn't ring. I woke up at half past eight and school began at nine. I quickly washed, dressed, jumped into my car and rushed to school. When I arrived, the students had already gone into class. I didn't go to the office, but went straight into class. After two or three minutes the students began laughing, and I couldn't understand why! Suddenly I looked down and understood. I had put on one black shoe and one brown shoe! Henry: The most embarrassing experience I've ever had happened two years ago. After seeing a film, my wife and I had lunch in our favorite restaurant in town. Then we decided to take a walk along the street. The street was very busy and we started holding hands. Suddenly my wife saw a dress that she liked in a shop window, and stopped. I started looking at some watches in the next window. After a minute or two I reached for my wife's hand. There was a loud _ , and a woman slapped my face. I hadn't taken my wife's hand. I'd taken the hand of a complete stranger !	['along the street']
Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	Doing well in high school prepare students for life in college and beyond, so achieving student success is important. High school students learn valuable information form class lectures and homework, and by asking for help when it is needed. Being prepared for tests and engaging in school activities can help a student to achieve success in high school. Complete any homework you are assigned on time. Then, if you need help understanding a concept you will have plenty of time to get help. Create a study area in your home. This can be a quiet bench outside or a seating area in your room. If you like to listen to music while studying, listen to classical or reading music. Be sure to have plenty of lighting in the area to read your textbook or notes. Keep a schedule. If you have extra-curricular activities like sports or school meetings, make sure to schedule your homework and study time around them. Keeping a schedule will allow you to get better grades while having fun in high school. Eat breakfast. Having breakfast each morning before school will give you energy and brain function to pay better attention in class. Eat snacks during study sessions to keep alert and focused on your work. Create a study group to help fellow high school students and get help if you need it. Studying with others will help reinforce concepts and information, and if you need help there will always be someone there to help you before you get behind in your studies. Set up after-school hours with your teacher if you need extra tutoring . Visiting a teacher for one-on-one time before a test will help you nail down those last few concepts you need help with.

To Mark, which is the most important lesson Steve taught him?	"My elder brother Steve, in the absence of my father who died when I was six, gave me important lessons in values that helped me grow into an adult. Steve taught me to face the results of my behavior. Once when I returned in tears from a Saturday baseball game, it was Steve who asked me what happened. When I explained that my baseball had soared through Mrs. Holt's basement window, breaking the glass with a crash, Steve encouraged me to admit to her. Although my knees knocked as I explained to Mrs. Holt, I offered to pay for the window from my pocket money if she would return my ball. I also learned from Steve that personal property is a sacred thing. After I found a shiny silver pen in my fifth-grade classroom, I wanted to keep it, but Steve explained that it might be important to someone else in spite of the fact that it had little value. He reminded me of how much I'd hate to lose to someone else the small dog my father made with a piece of cheap wood. I returned the pen to my teacher, Mrs. David, and still remembered the smell of her perfume as she patted me on the shoulder. Yet of all the instructions Steve gave me, his respect for life is the most unforgetful in my mind. When I was twelve I killed an old brown sparrow in the yard with a BB gun. Excited, I screamed at Steve to come and take a look. I shall never forget the way he stood for a long moment and stared at the bird on the ground. Then in a dead, quiet voice, he asked, ""Did it hurt you first, Mark?"" I didn't know what to answer. He continued with his eyes firm, ""The only time you should even think of hurting a living thing is when it hurts you first, and then you think a long, long time."" I really felt terrible then, but that moment stands out as the most important lesson my brother taught me."	['Respecting life.']
What is the passage mainly talking about?	Finding a good friend can be quite difficult in the contemporary lives of teenagers. I was once baffled by what the definition of a good friend was,until I discovered a single step that,if taken,would make you the greatest friend. It is willingness. That is all it takes in order to be considered a good friend. Willingness must come from within your heart. Listening to your friends makes them feel important, special and wanted. The will to sacrifice for your friends will also take you a step closer to being a good friend. For instance,as you are about to leave to enjoy your Saturday night,your best friend calls you right when you are stepping out and tells you how terrible he feels,and then you must be willing to give up your Saturday night and go to your friend's house and try to comfort him in any way that you can. You must always be willing to give advice to your friends. For example, if your friends are in a situation where they do not know what to do,you must be willing to think things through and try to give them the best advice. The willingness to care is also a big must in being a good friend. You must care about how your friends feel and what they're experiencing. Caring about your friends is one of the best things you can do,because when your friends are in their time of need and the whole world seems to turn against them,you must be the one to care. Nobody ever said being a good friend was easy. If you want to be a good friend,you have to be willing to listen, sacrifice,give advice and care about your friends.	['How to be a good friend.']
From the passage we can infer that in the US schools _ .	"More than 6,000 children were expelled from US school last year for bringing guns and bombs to school, the US Department of Education said on May 8. The department gave a report to the expulsions as saying handguns accounted for 58 percent of the 6,093 expulsions in 1996--1997, against 7 percent for rifles or shotguns and 35 percent for other types of firearms. ""The report is a clear sign that our nation's public schools are cracking down on students who bring guns to school,"" Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a statement. ""We need to be tough-minded about keeping guns out of our schools and do everything to keep our children safe."" In March 1997, an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy using handguns and rifles shot dead four children and a teacher at a school in Jonesboro, Arkansas. In October, two students were killed and seven wounded in a shooting at a Mississippi school. Two months later, a 14-year-old boy killed three high school students and wounded five in Dasucah, Kentucky. Most of the expulsions, 56 percent, were from high schools, which have students from about age 13. 34 percent were from junior high schools and 9 percent were from elementary schools, the report said."

He left school after taking six O-Levels because _ .	"Computer programmer David Jones earned $ 150,000 a year designing new computer games, yet he cannot find a bank prepared to let him have a check card . Instead, he has been told to wait another two years until he is 18. He works for a small firm in Liverpool, where most young people of his age are finding jobs. David's biggest headache is what to do with his money. Though he has high payment, he cannot drive a car, or get credit cards. David got his job four months ago, a year after leaving school with six O-Levels and working for a time in a computer shop. ""I got the job because the people who run the firm knew I had already written some programs,"" he said. ""I suppose $150,000 sounds a lot but I hope it will come to more than that this year."" He spends some of his money on records and clothes, and gives his mother $20 a week as he lives with his parents. But most of his spare time is spent working. ""Unfortunately, computing was not part of our studies at school,"" he said. "" But I had been studying it in books and magazines for four years in my spare time. I knew what I wanted to do and never considered staying on at school. Most people in this business are fairly young, anyway. I would like to earn a million and I suppose early retirement is a possibility. You never know when the market might disappear."	['he wanted to work with computers']

Which of the following is TRUE according to the article?	"Do your parents smoke? Where do they smoke - outside, at work or at home when you are around? According to a survey published in the journal Academic Pediatrics, an alarming number of US parents are still risking their children's lives by smoking in front of them. Half of all children aged 6 to 19, even those with asthma , have been exposed to second-hand smoke in the country, reported Reuters. ""It's well known that smoking kills, but many smokers still don't realize the damage their smoke causes to those around them,"" Dame Sally, Chief Medical Officer for England, was quoted by the Independent as saying. Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are poisonous. About 70 of them can cause cancer, not to mention other diseases, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What's most scary is that there is no safe level of contact with second-hand smoke---even ""low-level"" exposure can be harmful to one's health. And ""low-level"" means when a parent or family member smokes in another room or even outside. While second-hand smoke can be harmful to people of all ages, children face a greater risk than adults: they have smaller lungs; they breathe more quickly; and they have less developed immune systems. Also, young children have little control over their surroundings. Babies can't move to another room because the air is smoky. They depend on the adults in their lives to make sure that their environments are safe. Recent years have seen second-hand smoke exposure drop---but for adults rather than kids, because policies have been started around the world to ban smoking in public places such as offices, bars and restaurants. However, ""Children tend to be exposed to second-hand smoke in homes and cars, and these places are not included in most laws and policies,"" Amy Ferketich, a researcher at The Ohio State University, US, told Reuters. So what can we do to limit children's exposure to second-hand smoke? Parents should stop smoking for good. But if they can't, they should never smoke---or let others smoke---around their children."	['Dame Sally believes many parents who smoke in front of their kids have no idea of the damage that they are doing.']
If there's really a generation gap between you and your parents, you'd better _	Some people think only school children do not agree with their parents,however,it is not true. Communication is a problem for parents and children of all ages.If it's hard for you to communicate with your parents,don't worry about it.Here are some advice for you to bridge the generation gap . Don't argue with your parents.Don't get to your parents when you are angry.Your parents probably won't consider your ideas if you are shouting at them. And you can't express yourself well if you are angry. Go someplace to _ . Make sure you understand why you are unhappy. Then think about what you want to say to your parents. If you don't think you can speak to them at the moment, try writing a letter. Try to reach a compromise . Perhaps you and your parents disagree on something. You can keep your disagreement and try your best to accept each other. Michael's mother didn't agree with him about buying a motorcycle. They argued over it. But they finally came to a compromise. Michael bought the motorcycle, but only drove it on certain days. Of course, your parents might refuse to compromise on something. In these situations, it is especially important to show love and respect to them. Showing respect will keep your relationship strong. Talk about your values. The values of your parents are probably different from those of your own. Tell your parents what you care about, and why. Understanding your values might help them see your purposes in life. A good relationship with your parents can make you a better and happier person.	['have a talk with them often']

Someone hears and writes English very well, but he speaks it very badly. This is because _ .	"In order to know a foreign language thoroughly , four things are necessary. First, we must understand the language when we hear it spoken. Secondly, we must be able to speak it ourselves, correctly with confidence and without hesitation . Thirdly, we must be able to write it. We must be able to make sentences that are correct in grammar. There is no short way to succeed in language learning. A good memory is a great help, but it is not enough only to memorize the rules from a grammar book. It is no much use learning by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on. We must learn by using the language. If we are pleased with a few rules we have memorized, we are not really learning the language. We must ""Learn through use"". Practice is important. We must practise speaking and writing the language whenever we can."	['he often hesitates to practise speaking it']
What's the best title of the passage?	"Cindy, Jerry and Mary are giving their opinions about a good friend. Cindy: I think a good friend should be honest . That's more important than any other thing and is where a good friendship starts. _ Jerry: I think a good friend has to be generous. Here ""generous"" doesn't mean he has to give his friends his lunch money or his clothes. It means he should share his ideas and feelings with his friends.

When there's something wrong between him and his friends, he must put himself in his friends' place and think more for his friends."	['Opinions about a good friends.']

Which of the following statements is true?	"Nick Vujicic was born with no arms or legs, but the brave 32-year-old man, plays football and golf, swims, and surfs. Nick has a small foot on his left side, which helps him balance and enables him to kick. He uses his one foot to type, write with a pen and pick things up between his toes. ""I call it my chicken drumstick ,"" joked Nick, ""I'd be lost without it. When I get in the water I float because 80 per cent of my body is lungs and my drumstick acts as a propeller."" When Nick was born his father was so shocked he left the hospital room to vomit. His _ mother couldn't bring herself to hold him until he was four months old. ""It was so hard for them, but right from the start they did their best to make me independent. My dad put me in the water at 18 months and gave me the courage to learn how to swim. "" said Nick. Throughout his childhood Nick dealt with the typical challenges. At the age of seven, Nick tried out some specially designed electronic arms and legs, in hope that he would be more like the other kids. During the short trial period of the electronic arms and legs, Nick realized that even with them, he was still unlike his peers at school, and they turned out to be much too heavy for Nick to operate, affecting his flexibility quite significantly. ""When I was 13 I read a newspaper article about a disabled man who had managed to achieve great things and help others,"" said Nick, ""I realized why God had made us like this - to give hope to others. It was so inspirational to me that I decided to use my life to encourage others and decided to be thankful for what I do have, not get angry about what I don't."" ""I tell people to keep on getting up when they fall and to always love themselves,"" he said. ""If I can encourage just one person then my job in this life is done."" By now, he has visited 35 different countries, touring the world as a motivational speaker."	['Nick learned to be independent at a young age.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Do you often lose things? Don't worry. Now a new tool that can be connected to any object you might lose may be the way to solve your problem. The Tile, a small square linked up to your iphone or ipad by means of Bluetooth, lets you see how close you are to your missing item, within a 50-to-150-foot range. If the item goes out of your phone's 150-foot range, it can still be found on other smart phones with the same app. When you drive the app on your phone, it shows you, with green bars that increase or decrease, how close or far away you are from the Tile. You can also program it to make a sound when you get close to the Tile. And you can link up your phone with up to ten Tiles. And if your lost object--a dog, for example, or a stolen bike--go out of your own phone's 150-foot Bluetooth range, you can set it as a ""lost item"". If any of the phones with the Tile app comes within range of your lost item, a message will be sent to your phone, telling you its position. The Tile app also has the function to remember where it last saw your Tile, so that you can easily find where you left it. Since the Tiles use Bluetooth rather than GPS, they are never out of battery or needn't to be charged, and they work for one year before needing to be replaced. And the app works with all generations of iPhones and iPads. For further information, please visit www. tile666.com."	['The Tile cannot be linked up with a phone without Bluetooth.']
Why do some people favor competition according to the passage ?	"In modern society there is a great deal of argument about competition . Some value it highly , believing that it is responsible for social progress and prosperity . Others say that competition is bad ; that it sets one person against another ; that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people . I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth relied on how well they performed at tennis and other skills . For them, playing well and winning are often life-and-death affairs. In their single-minded pursuit ( )of success , the development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten . However ,while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed , others take an opposite attitude .In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the ordinary players , they strongly blame competition . Among _ are youngsters who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society . Teaching these young people . I often observe in them a desire to fail . They seem to seek failure by not trying to win or achieve success . By not trying , they always have an excuse : ""I may have lost . but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try . ""What is not usually admitted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost, that would mean a lot . Such a loss would be a measure of their worth . Clearly, this belief is the same as that of the true competitors who try to prove themselves . Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-respect relies on how well one performs in comparison with others . Both are afraid of not being valued . Only as this basic and often troublesome fear begins to dissolve can we discover a new meaning in competition ."	['It pushes society forward .']
The writer went to the park with his teachers _ .	Dae Jon is the city in South Korea, where I was born and grew up. There was a public park there. It was a very popular place, and I have tons of precious memories from times spent there. Our teachers often took us to that park for a spring or fall picnic. When I learned martial arts --Tae Kwon Do, my master usually took us there to train us. There was a hill there which was not high, so I could reach the peak within forty minutes even though I was very young. From the peak, I could see a lot of places if it was a sunny day. There was a huge rock on the top called Eagle Rock because the shape of the rock looked like the head of an eagle. We spent lots of fun days there. We played hide-and-seek within the limited area, and we sometimes caught frogs and fish in the pond. When we felt thirsty, we enjoyed drinking cold spring water. When I was a ten-year-old boy, I usually went to the park with my father to exercise early in the morning. It was quite dark, so I sometimes felt afraid, but after I got used to going there, I enjoyed breathing the fresh air and hearing the birds sing. Recently, I went back to the park to remember my good times there. When I arrived at the entrance, I was surprised because it didn't seem to be the same as I remembered it. Everything has changed in the thirteen years since I last saw it, but the good memories soon came back. I could almost imagine a boy playing there with a slight smile and shaking hands with me.

"What does ""the boss of the body"" mean?"	As we know, Human beings each have unique brains. The brain is of the greatest importance to the body. It is the boss of the body.Your eyes,ears,nose,and skin tell your brain what is going on around you.Other parts of your body tell your brain what is going on inside of you.Your brain takes in the signals.It tells your body what to do with them.When you touch fire,your skin tells your brain that your finger is too hot.Your brain tells you to move your finger.All these happen very fast.Your brain also controls your breathing,blinking,and heartbeat.It controls your feelings and thoughts too. Humans have the most developed brain of all animals.Yet it is not the largest brain.The human brain weighs three pounds.The brain of an elephant weighs 11 pounds.So the largest brain is not always the best brain.In people,a larger brain does not mean a clever person.

The writer must think her mother is a _ woman.	"On February 14th,2000,my class went on a field trip to the beach. I had so much fun.

Form this passage, we can know that _ .	"Recently,CCTV reporter have asked a simple question, ""Are you happy?"" The question has caught many interviewees off guard.

When a person is facing difficulties bravely, which metaphor can best describe him?	"If you were given a chance to choose your favorite life metaphor , what would it be? Do you agree with Forrest Gump's mother that life is ""a box of chocolates"" because ""you never know what you're going to get""? Or do you prefer the phrase from the 1930's song that ""life is just a bowl of cherries ""? Though simply stated, each conveys a very different view. A ""box"" implies mystery, because we don't know what is in a closed box. Meanwhile, a ""bowl"" of cherries is completely in view. For many centuries, the metaphor of life that probably burst into most people's mind was the one suggested by Shakespeare: ""All of life is a stage..."" On that stage, we take seven roles. More recently, psychologist Erik Erikson took up the idea of life as a stage. Erikson regarded development as a ""powerful unfolding"" in which we are driven from one stage to the next as our bodies, minds, and social roles develop. Stage metaphors fit with many of our common-sense ideas about change, but the problem with the stage metaphor is that it isn't particularly accurate. None of the studies that try to clarify the universality of adult life stages actually studied people as they developed over time. All of them were based on performances of their samples at one point in time. People's actual lives don't fit into these stage metaphors. They don't automatically transform when people reach a certain age. Instead, people's real lives are messy, unpredictable, and full of surprises. Today, I'd like to focus on an even longer study, an 80-year study which is the subject of a recent book by Howard Friedman and Leslie Martin. Their final chapter summarizes the ""many changes of healthy and unhealthy pathways"" that their participants took over the course of their lives. As I too discovered in my research, the pathway provides a perfect metaphor of human development. We don't all go down the same road marked with the same signposts based on age. People travel through diverse routes as they track the years of adulthood. Friedman and Martin use health and long life as their measure; I've used sense of achievement. In both cases, we are in perfect agreement in evaluating development not according to age but ""the key features of life"". The paths that Friedman and Martin describe seize the changes that characterize people as they age. Some examples are ""The High Road"" (reliable, full of plans); ""Not Easy Street"" (exposed to high stress throughout life), ""Catastrophe Lane"" (a downwardly twisty life); ""Happy Trails to You"" (cheerful, sociable), ""The Road to Resilience"" (able to handle stress with a strong will). Though I haven't yet been able to follow my participants for 80 years, I too saw some of these pathways among my samples: ""The Minding Way"" , ""The Downward Slope"" , ""The Straight and Narrow Path"" , and ""The Successful Trail"". The pathway metaphor gives you hope for changing the direction of your life if you are unhappy with it so far. You can't stop the clock from ticking the minutes between one birthday and the next, but you can adjust the road that you're on by changing yourself, your situation, or both."

What can we learn from the above passage about Jeremy Lin's instant popularity?	"NBA commissioner David Stern was in Orlando on Thursday night, getting ready for Sunday's All-Star Game. Of course, all he could talk about was the only player anyone wants to talk about these days: New York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin. Hours before Lin took the court against the Heat, a few hundred miles South down I-95 in Miami, Stern told reporters that Lin's instant popularity hasn't ever been matched in sports history, not even by Sunday's biggest names, LeBron James or Kobe Bryant. The Associated Press had the details. ""I haven't done a calculation, but it's fair to say that no player has created the interest and the craze in this short period of time, in any sport, that I'm aware of like Jeremy Lin has,"" Stern said Thursday. Lin, an undrafted guard from Harvard, has become the NBA's biggest story since coming off the Knicks' bench earlier this month to lead them to nine wins in 11 games heading into their matchup with Miami on Thursday night. With Lin's popularity in Asia as the league's first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent, and with the religious community because of his strong Christian faith, Stern says he's ""never quite seen anything like"" the attention on Lin. ""It's fascinating,"" Stern said after the All-Star Jam Session opening ceremonies. The top five videos on NBA.com since Feb. 4, when Lin joined the circulation, are all Lin or Knicks related. Lin went from 190,000 followers on Sina, China's version of Twitter, on Feb. 2 to more than 1 million as of Feb. 16. Indeed, Lin's popularity is so _ that the NBA made a late list switch to ensure his participation in the Rising Stars Challenge on All-Star Saturday, a game that includes the NBA's best rookies and sophomores. Lin is in such high demand that all of the game's other participants will meet with the media following a team practice on Friday while Lin will have his own, separate press conference later in the night. This is Jeremy's world, folks. We're all just living in it. Even David Stern and the rest of the league's All-Stars, at least for the moment."	['Every dog has its day.']
What does the author think of the first day in her new school?	"It was a very different school from those in China. You're not met by imposing doors and concrete walls, and the buildings were inviting. On the front of the main building was inscribed ""Lee Elementary School, 1904."" Wow! I knew it was an old school. Surrounding the main building were five trailers . One of them was my classroom, 5T. The ""T"" stood for Mrs. Toalson, my 5th grade teacher. Mrs Toalson showed me to my seat. A girl sitting at my table greeted me. Her name was Regina, and she was a blonde girl from Ukraine. Her eyes were like diamonds, and we had met at a party two days before. During my first morning, we had math class, PE and science. We didn't even have a break! I wondered why? Mrs Toalson said to us: ""Guys, line up for the bathroom break please!"" All the kids stood up and went outside. I didn't know what ""bathroom break"" meant. Was it break time? Lunch time? I was confused. Nevertheless, we followed Mrs. Toalson to the main building. We sat in the hallway across from the bathroom. In Chinese, ""bathroom"" means the WC, and a ""break"" means having a rest! Gosh, I thought that was weird and why did we have to go to the bathroom together? ""Mary and Regina, you may go."" When we heard Mrs. Toalson, we went into the bathroom. The bathroom was clean, and it smelled like perfume. I asked Regina what if someone wanted to go to the bathroom during class time. She told me that there was a special pass called a ""bathroom pass."" All you had to do was raise your hand with the pass to let Mrs. Toalson know you need to go to the bathroom. Then you would be permitted to go. At 3:30pm, school ended for the day. Students put their textbooks in their cabinets and lined up in front of the change room, where they collected their backpacks and coats. As they walked out of the door, each student said ""Good bye"" and gave Mrs. Toalson a high five. ""Did you have a good day today?"" Mrs. Toalson asked me as she hugged me goodbye. ""Sure!"" I nodded."	['Satisfying.']
The plants sent out signals _ .	"Because plants cannot move or talk, most people believe that they have no feelings and that they cannot receive signals from outside. However, this may not be completely true. People who studied plants have found out that plants carry a small electrical charge . It is possible to measure this charge with a small piece of equipment called ""galvanometer"". The galvanometer is placed on a leaf off the plant, and it records any changes in the electrical field of the leaf. Humans have a similar field which can change when we are shocked or frightened. A man called Backster used a galvanometer for his studies of plants and was very surprised at his results. He found that if he had two or more plants in a room and he began to destroy one of them - perhaps by pulling off its leaves or by pulling it out of its pot - then the galvanometer on the leaves of the other plants showed a change in the electrical field. It seemed as if the plants were signalling a feeling of shock. This happened not only when Backster started to destroy plants, but also when he destroyed other living things such as insects . Backster said that the plants also knew if someone had destroyed a living thing some distance away, because they signalled when a man who had just cut down a tree entered the room. Another scientist, named Sauvin, achieved similar results to Backster's. He kept galvanometers fixed to his plants all the time and checked regularly to see what the plants were doing. If he was out of the office, he telephoned to find out about the signals the plants were sending. In this way, he found that the plants were sending out signals at the exact times when he felt strong pleasure or pain. In fact, Sauvin could cause a change in the electrical field of his plants over a distance of a few miles simply by thinking about them."	['when Backster destroyed plants or other living things']
The author wants to tell us _ .	"When I was eleven years old, God gave me a gift of happiness and I had a carefree childhood in France. One day, on my way home from school, a truck ran over me and my legs were cut off. As I lay there bleeding, I suddenly realized that I might have to live the rest of my life without legs. How depressed I was at that moment! But then I realized that depression won't get my legs back. So I decided not to waste my life feeling depressed. When my parents arrived at the hospital, they stood there quietly, looked so shocked and sad. I told them, ""I've already accepted the fact. Now you also have to get used to this."" Ever since then, I often see my friends getting worried about little things: The buses comes late; they get bad grades on the tests and so on. But I just enjoy life. I was lucky to realize that it is a waste of energy to pay attention to what you have lost, and that the key to happiness is to take pleasure in what you have. Sounds simple, doesn't it? So why are many people unhappy? People often think happiness is based on what they achieve. ""My whole life would improve if I had a new car."" But when they get the car and what happens? For a whole week they are walking on air. Then they go right back to be unhappy. Happiness is not a happening; it's a state of mind. Even though you have the whole world and you'll still be unsatisfied. And you have relatively little but feel full of joy. Happiness comes from mastering the art of enjoying and taking pleasure in what you already have."	['happiness is just a state of mind']
Which of the following is conveyed in this article?	"Nicknames for Los Angeles A nickname is a shortened form of a person's name. A nickname can also be a descriptive name for a person, place or thing. Many American cities have nicknames. These can help establish an identity, spread pride among citizens and build unity. Nicknames can also be funny. Los Angeles, California is the second largest city in population, after New York City. Los Angeles has several nicknames. One is simply the city's initials, L.A. It is also called the City of Angels because Los Angeles means ""the angels"" in Spanish. Los Angeles often has warm, sunny weather. So another nickname is City of Flowers and Sunshine. New York is called The Big Apple. So Los Angeles is sometimes called The Big Orange because of the fruit that grows in that city's warm climate. The American motion picture and television industries are based in Los Angeles. So it is not surprising that it is called The Entertainment Capital of the World. Many films are made in the area of Los Angeles called Hollywood. Millions of people visit the area. Many movie stars live in Los Angeles. The city is sometimes called Tinseltown. This nickname comes from the shiny, bright and often unreal nature of Hollywood and the movie industry. Another nickname for Los Angeles is La-La Land, using the first letters of Los and Angeles. This means a place that is fun and not serious, and maybe even out of touch with reality. The city of Los Angeles is part of Los Angeles County. There are many smaller cities in the county. Beverly Hills, with its rich people, is one of them. So is Pasadena, with its Rose Parade each New Year's Day. So are the coastal cities of Santa Monica and Malibu, where people like to ride surfboards on the Pacific Ocean waves. A good place for watching unusual-looking people is Venice, an area on the west side of Los Angeles. A system of waterways designed after the Italian city of Venice has been built there. Many people love Los Angeles for its warm sunny weather, beautiful mountains and beaches, and movie stars. That includes Randy Newman, who sings about his hometown."

Why is there so much violence shown in movies, TV and video games?	"Nowadays people are troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies, television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what's wrong with a society that presents videos of violence as entertainment. Viewing large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality . Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: ""At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children."" Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out ""the most doubtful measures of aggression"", only 28% supported a connection. The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read ""aggressive"" or ""non-aggressive"" words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intention of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction. Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society."

What makes people like their acquaintances in books even more?	From good reading we can get pleasure, companionship, experience, and instruction. A good book may absorb our attention so completely that for the time being we forget our surroundings and even our identity. Reading good books is one of the greatest pleasures in life. It increases our contentment when we are cheerful, and lessens our troubles when we are sad. Whatever may be our main purpose in reading, our contact with good books should never fail to give us enjoyment and satisfaction. With a good book in our hands we need never be lonely. Whether the characters in it are taken from real life or are purely imaginary, they may become our companions and friends. In the pages of books we can walk with the wise and the good of all lands and all times. The people we meet in books may delight us either because they resemble human friends whom we hold dear or because they present unfamiliar types whom we are glad to welcome as new acquaintances . Our human friends sometimes may bore us, but the friends we make in books need never weary us with their company. By turning the page we can dismiss them without any fear of hurting their feelings. While human friends desert us, good books are always ready to give us friendship, sympathy, and encouragement. Of all the gifts from reading books, the most valuable one is experience. Few of us can travel far from home or have a wide range of experiences, but all of us can lead varied lives through the pages of books. Whether we wish to escape from the seemingly dull realities of daily routines or whether we long to visit some far-off place, a book will help us when nothing else can. To travel by book we need no bank account to pay our way; no airship or ocean liner or stream-lined train to transport us; no passport to enter the land of our heart's desire. Through books we may get the thrill of _ adventure without danger. We can climb high mountains, brave the perils of an Antarctic winter, or cross the scorching sands of the desert, all without hardship. In books we may visit the studios of Hollywood; we may mix with the merry crowds of the Paris boulevards; we may join the picturesque peasants in an Alpine village or the kindly natives on a South Sea island. Indeed, through books _ . The possibilities of our literary experiences are almost unlimited. The beauties of nature, the enjoyment of music, the treasures of art, the triumphs of architecture, the marvels of engineering, are all open to the wonder and enjoyment of those who read.

The old man went into the _ whenever he got to a school.	"A boy was going to study at the best school in town. In the morning, his grandfather took him to the school. When they went into the playground, the children came up. ""What a funny old man,"" the boy said, making a face. ""Hey, fatty ,""another one shouted. The children _ the pair(,) and jumped up and down. Without saying a word, the old man took his grandson out of the school gate. ""Wonderful! I don't have to go to school!"" the boy said. ""You do, but not this one,"" his grandfather said. ""I'll find you another school to go to."" Grandfather took his grandson back to his house, asked Grandmother to look after him, and then went out to look for a school alone. Every time he got to a school, the old man went into the playground, and waited for the children to come out at break time. In some schools the children completely ignored the old man, and in others, they made fun of him. When this happened, he would turn sadly and leave. Finally, he went into the very small playground of a very small school, and stood tiredly against the wall. The bell rang, and the children came out into the playground. ""Sir, are you all right? Shall I bring you something to drink?"" said a voice. ""We've got a bench in the playground. Come and sit down,"" came another voice. Soon a young teacher came out into the playground. The old man greeted him and said, ""Finally, I've found my grandson the best school in town."""	['playground']
What the Frenchman said means that _ .	"An Englishman, a Frenchman and a Russian were discussing happiness. ""Happiness,"" said the Englishman, ""Happiness is when you return home tired after work, yet find your slippers warming by the fire."" ""You English have no romance,"" said the Frenchman. ""Happiness is when you go on a business trip, find a pretty girl who entertains you -then afterwards you part without regrets ."" ""You are both wrong,"" said the Russian.

We learn from the passage_.	I am Greek,and my family go to Greece every summer.Uncle Spyro and my God-mother Aunt Aspa lived about 45 minutes outside of Athens.Every summer when we traveled to Greece.we would spend a couple of days with them. I remember all then things we would do there..We would shake almonds off the branches of Uncle Spyro's almond tree.Using his strong hands,he would break the shells off.and present us with the shiny white nut.With Aunt Aspa we would pick lemons off her lemon trees and carry them inside the small house with the help of Uncle Spyro.Drinking the fresh lemonade and eating the delicious almonds,we would sit on the porch and talk.Uncle Spyro and Aunt Aspa didn't speak English,and my Greek wasn't and still isn't perfect.But those peacefully quiet times on the porch were the times that I miss the most. Uncle Spyro developed cancer from smoking for most of his life and he became very sick. We didn't go to Greece in 2000,but we planned on going again in 2001.We found out that Uncle Spyro was in the hospital shortly before we left for Greece.My mother,Alethea,and I wanted to see him.But we waited until the day after we arrived.Now,I wish that we had gone the first daywe had arrived and that we had seen him for the last time. But my uncle didn't wait for us to go. We still Visit Aunt Aspa,and we still pick almonds and lemons.We still drink the fresh lemonade and eat the delicious almonds on the porch.But somehow the lemonade isn't as fresh and the almonds aren't as delicious as before. I thank God that I'm still here to comfort Aunt Aspa and that I'm still here to finish my life.I'm not afraid of death anymore like some people.And I know that when I do die,I'll just be going up to Uncle Spyro,and we'll eat almonds and drink lemonade,just like before.

Which of the following was NOT true about the color1 of the universe?	What is the color1 of the universe? Astronomers had not answered this question, until two months ago. That is when two American astronomers reported on their study of all the light in the universe. They said that the universe would appear to the human eye to be a light greenish color1, called turquoise . Karl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, reported their finding in January. They presented the research at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. They said that finding the color1 of the universe was not part of their serious scientific research. They did it for fun. However, earlier this month, the scientists admitted to making a mistake. They said their finding was much more color1ful than it should have been. They now say the light from our universe is closer to white. It is more like a milky or creamy white color1. Their study attempted to show what people might see if they could observe the universe from far away. The scientists found the average color1 by combining light from about two-hundred-thousand star systems. Their information came from an observatory in New South Wales, Australia. These scientists and color1 engineers attempted to reproduce the result. Mark Fairchild of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York was the first person to identify a mistake. He discovered a mistake in the computer software program used by the Johns Hopkins scientists. When the mistake was corrected, the results changed. The new color1 of the universe is much less color1ful. It is very close to white. The scientists have apologized for the mistake. They are now working with the Rochester Institute of Technology to produce more images of the color1 of the universe. They also asked for suggestions for a name for the new color1 of the universe.

Semler made a variety of changes in his company Except that _ .	"At 21,Ricardo Semler became boss of his father's business in Brazil,Semco,which sold parts for ships. Semler Junior worked like a mad man,from 7:30 am,until midnight every day. One afternoon,while touring a factory in New York,he broke down. The doctor who treated him said,""There's nothing wrong with you. But if you continue like this, you'll find a new home in our hospital. ""Semler got the message. He changed the way he worked. In fact,he changed the ways his employees worked too. He let his workers take more responsibility so that they would be the ones worrying when things went wrong. He allowed them to set their own salaries,and he cut all the jobs he thought were unnecessary,like receptionists and secretaries. This saved money and brought more equality to the company. ""Everyone at Semco,even top managers,meets guests in reception,does the photocopying,sends faxes,types letters and dials the phone."" He completely reorganized the office:instead of walls,they have plants at Semco,so bosses can't shut themselves away from everyone else. And the workers are free to decorate their workspace as they want. As for uniforms,some people wear suits and others wear T-shirts. Semco has flexible working hours:the employees decide when they need to arrive at work. Also,Semco lets its workers use the company's machines for their own projects,and makes them take holidays for at least thirty days a year. It sounds perfect,but does it work? The answer is in the numbers:in the last six years,Semco's revenues have gone from $35 million to $212 million. The company has grown from eight hundred employees to 3,000. Why? Semler says it's because of ""peer pressure"". Peer pressure makes employees work hard for everyone else. If someone isn't doing his job well,the other workers will not allow the situation to continue. In other words,Ricardo Semler treats his workers like adults rather than children, and expects them to act like responsible adults. And they do."	['the employees can take only 30 days off for holiday every year.']
The passage is most probably from _ .	"A new report shows what life might be like in 100 years from now. It describes skyscrapers that are much taller than today's buildings, underwater ""bubble"" cities and holidays in space. The report is from a company. It asked experts on space and architecture, as well as city planners, to give their ideas on the life in 2116. They said the way we live, work and play will be totally different to how we do these things today. The experts used the Internet as an example. They said that 25 years ago, people could not imagine how the Internet and smartphones would change our lives. The Internet has completely changed the way we communicate, learn and do daily things. The experts said the changes in the next century would be even more unbelievable. Researchers questioned 2,000 adults about the prediction they thought were most likely to happen in the future. They predicted that in the future, few people will go to an office but will work from home and have work meetings online. People will have highly developed 3-D printers that will let you download a design for furniture or a food recipe and then ""print"" the sofa, table or pizza at home. There will also be less need for visits to the doctor. We will all have a home health instrument that will tell us what the problem is and give us treatment. We will also be going into space for holidays and to get resources that we have used up on Earth. A prediction that is missing is whether people will still need to study English. ,A, B, C, D,."

What did the writer learn from her dream?	"People were hanging out of their apartment windows screaming down at me,""Just give up,you fool! You'll never make it with that little bike.""I kept telling them repeatedly,""All I have is this three-wheeled tricycle.""I kept tipping to the side,but I kept my balance and ignored the people who were making fun of me. Then at one point a man left his home and ran out into the middle of the street. ""This bike will take forever at the speed you're going!"" He continued screaming words of discouragement right in my face. I replied,""I must push forward;I must get to the finish line! "" I held on as tightly as possible and rode straight ahead with great determination. I had unshakable faith that I would make it! I also knew it did not matter how long it would take,because I knew it was worth it. At that point,the dream came to an abrupt end I got up and remembered the dream very clearly. I also remembered that the night before I was feeling discouraged -- but now I felt happy and peaceful, and my spirit felt alive with hope. I think we've all been given small tricycles as adults,and we struggle to balance our lives down the dark,narrow streets of mortality . I now consider the tricycle to be my three wheels of hope. The dream has given me courage and hope that I will finish the race inch by inch. I know I must never give up,but press forward always."	['She must struggle on,however difficult life is.']
Which of the following physical activities can keep going on and on?	"Smaller than your fist, your healthy heart just goes on and on. It will beat more than 60 times a minute for 70 years or more. That's something that most of us take for granted. But it's an amazing fact. 60 times a minute for 60 minutes is 3,600 times. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe. Tap our fingers on the desk? No. Jump up and down? Certainly not! But our heart keeps beating, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels . It takes you about five years to drink 2,000 gallons of water. And, unlike your knees or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining ! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable ""silent partner"" that people forget to care for it. For many, the first indication that their heart isn't working properly is a serious heart illness! Over 650,000 Americans die of some kind of heart disease every year. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually. Like accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of the experts. Unfortunately, most people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, ""It won't happen to me. "" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They continue to eat too much meat. And their only ""exercise"" is getting off the sofa to get something out of the fridge. Please follow the following steps to keep your heart healthy."	['Heart beat.']
According to the passage,we know Junelle Lynch _ .	"Junelle Lynch knocked on more than 200 doors in the Gayln Manor neighborhood of Brunswick in recent weeks.

According to the author, iPhones are popular with both adults and young kids because they are _ .	"The bedroom door opened and a light went on, signaling an end to nap time.The toddle , sleepy-eyed, clambered to a swinging stand in his crib.He smiled, reached out to his father, and uttered what is fast becoming the cry of his generation: ""iPhone!"" Just as adults have a hard time putting down their iPhones, so the device is now the Toy of Choice for many 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds.The phenomenon is attracting the attention and concern of some childhood development specialists. Natasha Sykes, a mother of two in Atlanta, remembers the first time her daughter, Kelsey, now 3 but then barely 2 years old, held her husband's iPhone.""She pressed the button and it lit up.I just remember her eyes.It was like 'Whoa!' ""The parents were charmed by their daughter's fascination.But then, said Ms.Sykes (herself a Black Berry user), ""She got serious about the phone."" Kelsey would ask for it.Then she'd cry for it.""It was like she'd always want the phone,"" Ms.Sykes said. Apple, the iPhone's designer and manufacturer, has built its success on machines so user-friendly that even technologically blinded adults can figure out how to work them, so it makes sense that sophisticated children would follow.Tap a picture on the screen and something happens.What could be more fun? The sleepy-eyed toddler who called for the iPhone is one of hundreds of iPhone-loving toddlers whose parents are often proud of their offspring's ability to slide fat fingers across the gadget's screen and pull up photographs of their choice. Many iPhone apps on the market are aimed directly at preschoolers, many of them labeled ""educational,"" such as Toddler Teasers: Shapes, which asks the child to tap a circle or square or triangle; and Pocket Zoo, which streams live video of animals at zoos around the world. Along with fears about dropping and damage, however, many parents sharing iPhones with their young ones feel guilty.They wonder whether it is indeed an educational tool, or a passive amusement like television.The American Academy of Pediatrics is continually reassessing its guidelines to address new forms of ""screen time."" Dr.Gwenn Schurgin O'Keeffe, a member of the academy's council, said, ""We always try to throw in the latest technology, but the cellphone industry is becoming so complex that we always come back to the table and wonder- Should we have a specific guideline for _ "" Tovah P. Klein, the director of a research center for Toddler Development worries that fixation on the iPhone screen every time a child is out with parents will limit the child's ability to experience the wider world. As with TV in earlier generations, the world is increasingly divided into those parents who do allow iPhone use and those who don't. A recent post on UrbanBaby.com, asked if anyone had found that their child was more interested in playing with their iPhone than with real toys. The Don't mothers said on the Website: ""We don't let our toddler touch our iPhones ... it takes away from creative play."" ""Please ... just say no. It is not too hard to distract a toddler with, say ... a book."" Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a psychology professor who specializes in early language development, sides with the Don'ts. Research shows that children learn best through activities that help them adapt to the particular situation at hand and interacting with a screen doesn't qualify, she said. Still, Dr. Hirsh-Pasek, struck on a recent visit to New York City by how many parents were handing over their iPhones to their little children in the subway, said she understands the impulse . ""This is a magical phone,"" she said. ""I must admit I'm addicted to this phone."""	['easy to use']
Why does the author advise people to hunt in some special stores?	When I spent Christmas away from home in Europe for the first time, I was only 14 and it was absolutely terrible. I am now married and live in the US. So there is little possibility for me to go home for Christmas. Now I am able to get through Christmas with some moments of joy: First, you are advised to search your area for stores that carry items from your home country or town. Buy food, candles and some other things that mean something to you. Hold on to the traditions from your home that you think are important even if other people think they are stupid. But keep in mind to be open for new traditions from wherever you might be, because those traditions are as important to those people around you as yours are to you. For me that includes celebrating Christmas on the 24th. Call, write Christmas cards, buy gifts and mail them to loved ones, just as if you were there. If you try to pretend as if the holiday doesn't exist, you are just going to make it worse. Introduce your traditions to your loved ones, especially your kids. It will only enrich their celebration of the holiday to have some unique traditions in their home. Little by little it will become their tradition and it's fun for them to try something new. Find clubs, churches or organizations that are from your home country. Chances are that they will have some celebration with some of your traditions which you can join in. Food is one of the most important factors in any kind of tradition. Find the recipe of that cake your grandmother used and make it your tradition to bake that particular cake. Call up your parents and get them to send you some of your favorite childhood ornaments for your tree. Pay attention to new traditions, talk to your family about which ones you want to make your own and stick with them. If you are far away from home, Christmas can never be the same as you experienced it before, but it is important to remember these traditions while appreciating the new ones. Keep an open mind and find a compromise between old and new traditions.	['Because they offer goods from the hometown of the people.']
If you want to watch hippos carefully, you'd better _ .	Tanzania is a country which has a lot of animals, such as gnus , lions, cheetahs(, elephants, giraffes, crocodiles and so on. Every year, many people in the world travel to this African country to watch the animals closely. But do you know how they travel? By bus--This is the most common way. When people get on a bus, they'll find that the bus is a little strange. It is different from the buses we often see. There are no big windows at all, but some small windows. And it looks like a cage. What are they used for? Oh, people can use it to watch animals, especially those dangerous animals, and take photos. We know that people are most interested in the lions. So when two buses meet , the drivers will stop and ask each other whether they have found lions. By boat--We can often see many people are in a boat, enjoying the beautiful scene along a river of a lake, and they can also enjoy hippos and crocodiles from a nearer distance. By hot balloon --In the early morning, when the sun is beginning to rise, a large hot balloon is also starting its journey. Taking a hot balloon makes most of the travelers excited. After some time, the balloon will land in a certain place, and the waiters will serve people a delicious and special breakfast. But the cost of taking a hot balloon is also very high. A person should pay 400 dollars for an hour's trip.	['be on a boat']
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside other traditional subjects such as math and languages. The class sit in a circle with their eyes shut and they count from one to ten: someone starts, the next voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side. The aim of the game is to listen for an opportunity to shout out the number without clashing with another voice or leaving a pause. On the first try, most of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in, but by the fifth time round, they develop a rhythm .The message: give other people space but also confidently claim your own. This is a requirement for social well-being. The Willy Hellpach School in Heidelberg is the first in the nation to develop a happiness course. It is intended for students preparing for university entrance exams. ""The course isn't there to make you happy,"" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned pupils, ""but rather to help you discover the ways to become happy."" Cooking a meal together is one of the class exercises. Improving body language under the guidance of two professional actresses is another. The course is taught for three periods a week. Although it's the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter. ""In the first period, we had to each say something positive about another member of the class and about ourselves. No laughing at people,"" said Fanny, 17. Research by the school shows it is not the first to start happiness classes: they also exist at some US universities, mainly based on positive thinking, using findings from studies of depression."	"[""the students' self-respect can also improve happiness""]"
What's the best title for the passage?	"Did you ever wonder how some of your favorite foods, products or toys came about? Believe it or not, they may have been an accident, or a failure of some other intention. Below, we found three mistakes we're thankful for turned out to be what they are. 1. Most historians hold that the Chinese invented fireworks in the 9th century when they discovered how to make gunpowder. Story has it that a Chinese cook accidentally mixed together what were then considered common kitchen items and noticed they burnt. When put tightly in a bamboo tube and lit, it blew up. 2. In May of 1886, a law led John Pemberton, a pharmacist , to rewrite the formula for ""Pemberton's French Wine Coca,"" his popular headache treatment. Containing sugar instead of wine as a sweetener, the outcome became something for Coke, which was later mixed with carbonated water. His bookkeeper suggested the name Coca-Cola because he thought the two C's would look good together, which is how what we call Coca-Cola, a world -wide drink came into being. 3. During World War II, scientists at the University of Birmingham invented the magnetron--an important heat-producing part of the microwave oven . While working for Raytheon Corporation after the war, the American engineer Percy Spencer was testing the magnetron when a chocolate bar in his pocket melted. He went on to test other foods including popcorn kernels, and found it to be a much more efficient way to cook. In 1947 Raytheon came out with the first restaurant microwave oven, which was six feet tall and weighed 750 lbs."	['Stories of Accidental Inventions.']
What was the purpose of building the Brooklyn Bridge?	Opened in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first longspan bridge to carry motor traffic, and it quickly became the model for the great suspension bridges of the following century. Spanning New York's East River, it provided the first traffic artery between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter. The construction of a bridge over the EastRiver had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 _ all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State passed an act setting up the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held aggressive views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous figure. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination. Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two towers in the East River serving as the main piers. The bridge that was actually built is longer--1,597 feet (486 m), the longest suspension bridge at that time.	['To provide faster and safer transportation than boats.']
When grandma was at her lowest, what did Daniel do to bring her back to her usual life?	"My grandson, Daniel, and I have always been very close. When Daniel's father remarried after a divorce, Daniel, who was eleven, and his little sister, Kristie, came to live with us. My husband and I were more than happy to have kids in the house again. Things were going along just fine until the diabetes I've lived with most of my adult life started affecting my eyes, and then more seriously, my kidneys . Then everything seemed to fall apart. Three times a week, I had to go to the hospital to be hooked up to a dialysis machine . I was living, but I couldn't really call it a life -- it was an existence. I had no energy. I dragged myself through daily chores and slept as much as I could. My sense of humor seemed to disappear. Daniel, seventeen by then, was really affected by the change in me. He tried as hard as he could to make me laugh, to bring back the grandma who loved to clown around with him. Even in my sorry state, Daniel could still bring a smile to my face. But things were not improving. After a year on dialysis, my condition was deteriorating and the doctors felt that if I didn't receive a kidney transplant within six months, I would surely die. No one told Daniel this, but he knew -- he said all he had to do was look after me. To top it off, as my condition worsened, there was a chance that I would become too weak to have the transplant surgery at all, and then there would be nothing they could do for me. So we started the tense and desperate wait for a kidney. I was adamant that I didn't want a kidney from anyone I knew. I would wait until an appropriate kidney became available, or I would literally die waiting. But Daniel had other plans. The time that he took me to my dialysis appointments, he did a little secret research on his own. Then he announced his intention to me. ""Grandma, I'm giving you one of my kidneys. I'm young and I'm healthy ..."" He paused. He could see I wasn't at all happy with his offer. He continued, almost in whisper, ""And most of all, I couldn't stand it if you weren't around."" His face wore an expression of appeal mixed with determination. He can be as stubborn as a mule once he decides on something -- but I've been told many times that I can out-stubborn any mule! We argued. I couldn't let him do it. We both knew that if he gave up his kidney, he would also give up his life's dream; to play football. It was all he ever talked about. And he was good, too. Daniel was co-captain and star defensive tackle of his high school team; he expected to apply for a football scholarship and was looking forward to playing college football. He just loved the sport. ""How can I let you throw away the thing that means the most to you?"" I pleaded with him. ""Grandma,"" he said softly, ""compared to your life, football means nothing to me."" After that, I couldn't argue anymore. So we agreed to see if he was a good donor match, and then we'd discuss it further. When the tests came back, they showed Daniel was a perfect match. That was it. I knew I wasn't going to win that argument, so we scheduled the transplant. Both surgeries went smoothly. As soon as I came out of the anesthesia , I could tell things were different. I felt great! The nurses in the intensive care unit had to keep telling me to lie back and be quiet -- I wasn't supposed to be that lively! I was afraid to go to sleep, for fear I would break the spell and wake up the way I had been before. But the good feeling didn't go away, and I spent the evening joking and laughing with anyone who would listen. It was so wonderful to feel alive again. The next day they moved me out of ICU and onto the floor where Daniel was recuperating three doors away. His grandfather helped him walk down to see me as soon as I was moved into my room. When we saw each other, we did not know what to say. Holding hands, we just sat there and looked at each other for a long time, overwhelmed by the deep feeling of love that connected us. Finally, he spoke, ""Was it worthwhile, grandma?"" I laughed a little ruefully . ""It was for me! But was it for you?"" I asked him. He nodded and smiled at me. ""I've got my grandma back."" And I have my life back. It still amazes me. Every morning, when I wake up, I thank God --and Daniel -- for this miracle. A miracle born of the purest love."	['He tried his best to make her laugh.']

It is implied in the passage that _ .	Few people would question the value of taking part in sports for young people. With proper training, supervision, protective equipment and techniques, and a proper emphasis on winning, sports can develop a healthy body and spirit and a life-long interest in being active and fit. Without such measures, childhood sports can lead to injuries and even paralysis or death. Even in the best conditions, no activity can be risk-free. But most serious dangers are preventable. Cyclists and football players can reduce their risks by wearing helmets, hockey players by wearing masks; basketball and tennis players by wearing eye guards; baseball players by wearing batting helmets. Besides, risks to individual players can often be found, and thus prevented, through a properly performed medical exam before a child plays. For accidents that may not be preventable, having an emergency plan and first-aid equipment, and someone trained to use the equipment, can be lifesaving. Still, each year, according to the American College of Sports Medicine, more than 775, 000 children under 14 are treated in emergency rooms for sports injuries, nearly half of them preventable. An estimated 300,000 athletes experience exercise-related head illnesses each year, and almost all of them should have been avoided. Further, from half to three-fourths of sports-related concussions are never even diagnosed; the injured are often sent back to play too soon and put at risk of another more serious brain-damaging concussion. To help reduce these risks, the National Center for Sports Safety, with the National Athletic Trainers' Association, offers a three-hour online safety course for coaches for $28 at www. SportsSafety. Org.	['prevention of injuries is not paid enough attention to']

Why do you need to start planning for a vacation to Disney World well in advance?	A trip with your family and friends to Disney World can be one of the best vacations of your life. When you decide to travel to this destination, you can be sure in the knowledge that you are going to have a great time. Many travelers may be worried about the exorbitant amount of money that one has to pay for a comfortable and fun trip to Disney World. We all want to give our family and children the best time since it may only be a once in a lifetime vacation. However it would not be wise to end up in debt over a week-long stay in Disney World. A few handy tips and a little planning can make a lot of difference and can reduce some of your financial worries. You need to start planning for a vacation to Disney World well in advance. The first step is deciding what time of year you wish to visit it. The peak seasons of the year will be costly for the accommodations whether you are staying within or outside the theme park. Staying outside the resort is a choice that may save you a large amount of money if you plan to stay for a week or two. Also, there are plenty of budget hotels outside Disney World that offer cheap and pleasant accommodations with shuttle services. Another money saving tip is to buy food ahead of time. If you have most of your meals at your hotel or at cheaper restaurants, it will save you a lot of money. You can try not to buy food in and around Disney World. Carrying food and beverages and enough cold water would help you reduce the cost, too.	['You can make it more economical to travel to Disney World.']
What might be the best title of the passage?	"Analysis of the composition of quicksand shows that there are four key ingredients--sand, obviously water, clay and salt. Together these materials form a structure resembling a house of cards, with large water-filled gaps between the sand particles, which are loosely glued in place by the clay. As long as it's left alone, the structure remains stable. But as soon as it's disturbed, by stepping on it, the clay changes from a jelly-like consistency to a runny liquid. The effect is the same as stirring a pot of yoghurt. Liquefying the clay makes the quicksand about one million times runnier, and the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, with you inside it. Very quickly, the sand sinks to the bottom and the water floats to the top. This is where the salt comes in. When there's enough salt present, as soon as the clay particles liquefy, electrical charges make them begin to stick together to form bigger particles and these also settle with the sand. Quicksand is a mixture which looks like solid, but behaves more like a liquid. Despite its murderous reputation, quicksand does not such people under and swallow them, although it can hold a person in firm grip. The human body is more buoyant in quicksand than in water, and sooner or later anyone trapped in it will float. Unlike most liquids, quicksand's viscosity, or ""runniness"" can suddenly change if it comes under pressure, for example under a human foot. The surface gives way and the victim quickly sinks in up to the knees, surrounded by an area of dirty things that turns semi-solid around its victim. Escaping from the quicksand's grip requires a large amount of force. Without something solid to pull at, people often find they are stuck fast. Pulling at one leg simply makes the other one sink further. So how do you escape from quicksand's control? Stay still and call for help. Staying still stops you sinking any further, until--with luck--help arrives on the scene. If no one appears and you need to draw yourself out, gently lie down on your back until your body is floating on the sand. Next, roll over onto your stomach and pull yourself forwards with your hands, so that you gradually ""swim"" towards firmer ground. It is a slow and dirty business, but it works. This technique has one barrier: it goes against a very powerful human nature. Faced with danger in the open, nine out of ten stay on their feet so that they can run away, in which case it can worsen the situation."	['What to do if trapped in quicksand']
_ makes Woolworth a world-famous man.	"Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always runs his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""www.ks5u.com"	['His business skills and his wealth.']

We can learn that by getting water with a basket, the grandson _ .	"An old farmer lived on a farm with his young grandson. Each morning Grandpa was up early to read his Bhagavat Geeta. His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to imitate him in every way he could. One day the grandson asked, ""Grandpa! I try to read the Bhagavat Geeta just like you but I don't understand it, What good does reading the Bhagavat Geeta do?"" The Grandfather quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied, ""Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water."" The boy did as he was told, but all the water leaked out before he got back to the house. The grandfather laughed and said, ""You'll have to move a little faster next time,"" and sent him back to the river with the basket to try again. This time the boy ran faster, but again the same took place. He told his grandfather that it was impossible to carry water with a basket. The old man said, "" You're just not trying hard enough,"" So the boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran hard, but when he reached his grandfather the basket was again empty. he said, ""See Grandpa, it's useless!"" ""So you think it is useless?"" The old man said, ""Look at the basket."" The boy looked at the basket and for the first time realized that the basket was different. It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket into a clean one inside and outside. ""You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read it, you will be changed, inside and out.

According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?	"The film Avatar has been a hit at the box office in the UK and around the world, becoming the fastest film ever to earn $1bn (7bn yuan) in ticket sales. But the world of the sci-fi epic Avatar is so perfect that people have admitted being troubled by depression and suicidal thoughts at not being able to visit the planet. Set in the future when Earth's resources have run out, director James Cameron's film tells the story of a corporation trying to mine a rare mineral. The humans conflict with the natives-- a peace-loving race of 7ft tall, blue-skinned creatures called the Na'vi, who exist in perfect harmony with nature. Fans have flooded the internet with their confused feelings. On the site Avatar Forums , the topic ""Ways to cope with the depression of the dream of Pandora being intangible "" has more than 1,000 posts. In a similar forum, one user wrote, ""When I woke up this morning after watching Avatar for the first time yesterday, the world seemed grey. It just seems so meaningless."" ""I still don't really see any reason to keep doing things at all. I live in a dying world."" On another site, one fan was even more affected, admitting, ""I even consider suicide, thinking that if I do it I will be rebirthed in a world similar to Pandora."" On the Avatar site Naviblue, a fan calling himself Jorba has even asked others to join him in starting a real Na'vi tribe . Dr Stephan Quentzel, psychiatrist and Medical Director in New York told CNN, ""Virtual life is not real life and it never will be, but this is the pinnacle of what we can build in a virtual presentation so far."" ""It has taken the best of our technology to create this virtual world and real life will never be as utopian as it seems on screen. It makes real life seem more imperfect."" But not everyone viewing the film has been hit by the ""Avatar Blues"", as a small but vocal group have claimed it contains racist themes-- the white hero once again saving the primitive natives. Since the film opened three weeks ago, hundreds of blog posts, newspaper articles and YouTube videos have said things such as the film is ""a fantasy about race told from the point of view of white people"" and that it strengthens ""the white Messiah fable ."" The film's writer and director, James Cameron, says the real theme is about respecting others' differences."	['The perfection created in the film makes some viewers think of committing suicide.']

People choose self-tracking because _ .	"What Is Self-tracking All about Perhaps you've tracked how many kilometers you've run, how many hours you've slept or how much you've eaten in a day. If so, you've taken part in a popular movement called the ""Quantified Self Movement"" or ""Self-tracking"". Maybe you've wanted to change a bad habit but couldn't. Self-tracking may be your answer. The idea is to collect information about your everyday activities and analyze them to help improve and form a healthier lifestyle. Recently, tools such as smartphones, apps, along with newly published wearable things, are making self-tracking easy. Today, one can use Fitbit, the Jawbone Up, Google Glass or a smart watch to record personal data including sleeping hours, stress levels, heart rate and mood. So why does a person self-track? Someone may be trying to lose weight or improve their sleep. Another person feels tired after eating. Self-tracking could help him to know what foods make him sleepy and watch his diet. [:Z#xx#k.Com] Tracking daily activities isn't a new concept. In years past, athletes and their coaches kept notes food, training and sleep in order to achieve an athletic goal. Similarly, doctors have also helped patients to record parts of their lifestyles and eating habits to help fight health problems. However, it wasn't until 2007 that magazine writers Gary Wolf and Kim Kelly created the term ""Quantified Self"" or ""self-tracking"". Although self-tracking has many advantages, Dennis Nash, president of Data Speaks Health Solutions, says self-tracking has its disadvantages. Once people start tracking their daily activities, it can become an extra task people like to do often. Also, they might begin to worry too much about their health. Though self-tracking doesn't make sure that one's quality of life will improve, it can encourage people to make healthier choices."	['it collects personal data and leads to self- improvement']
The purpose of the passage is to teach you _ .	"Your best friend is possibly the most important person in your life. But sometimes friendship's road is not always smooth, or it's a total dead end. What do you do when this happens? Scenario 1: Drifting Apart You've found that your friend no longer wants to jog with you. She'd rather hit the chat rooms, or she's become crazy about hanging with her new interest. It's a _ when old friends start having less in common. But it might still be worth trying to get into your friend's new interest, trying something new on your own, or meet some new folks who like doing the things you enjoy. Another thing to try is talking to your friend about it- in a non-this-is-your-fault way. The goal is telling how you feel, not ""winning"". Scenario 2: Fights ""Yes, he is."" ""No, he isn't."" the argument could continue forever. No matter how sure you are that you're right, friendship is based on RESPECT. Since you and your friend aren't clones , you will disagree sometimes! Is it worth fighting over? If it is trivial , why not give it up? Agree to disagree and get on well with life. Even if you'll never agree, try to see the other person's viewpoint. At least honor his right to have his own opinions. Never get physical. Violence can make a small problem into a disaster. Scenario 3: End of the Road Is the friendship over? If you are not the one ending it, it feels as if a knife cut your heart into pieces. But the thing is that you can't force someone to be your friend. Give yourself time. But don't freeze in a looking-back, holding pattern . Be open to new friendship. You never know when the ""best friend forever"" will come along."	['what to do when a friendship changes']
The author has written the passage in a (an) _ way.	"I was sitting in the room reading when I heard a loud noise. To defend my home from break-in, I picked up my defense weapon--- a broom and went out. There on the roof of my porch , I saw a grey fluffy squirrel. I drove her away with the broom, but the next day I heard her again. I searched squirrels on the net and found because their teeth keep growing, they have to constantly chew on things to shorten their teeth. This was disturbing so I asked my husband to call in some wildlife control people. On Monday morning two men showed up, with guns in their hands. I pointed uneasily to the hole in my porch roof. They held up their guns. Suddenly I saw in my mind the baby nursery inside. I stopped them and confirmed that they wouldn't harm her. They hesitated, but finally put down their guns. Then they brought out a bottle of deodorizer and sprayed it into the squirrel's home. They told me she would not like the smell and would leave. There was no sign of Mrs. Squirrel, so they blocked the hole, took my cheque for $250 and left. Shortly after they left, Mrs. Squirrel returned from her shopping trip. She was mad at being driven out and began feverishly clawing at the porch roof. In order to stop the destruction of my home, I drove her away with the broom again. Each day thereafter, Mrs. Squirrel continued her attack on my possession. I then called the company to report that ""SHE'S BAAAAAACK..."" The receptionist said that if Mrs. Squirrel had managed to find another way into my porch roof, it would be a new charge. I replied I couldn't continue contributing my husband's hard-earned income to their silly wildlife experts and hang up. I went to the porch and banged on the roof. Mrs. Squirrel came out and glared at me. We negotiated some terms, came to an agreeable arrangement and went back into our respective homes. All is quiet these days, although large quantities of materials have been removed from my garage wall and my daughter claims that some of her doll-house furniture has disappeared. I still hope that Mrs. Squirrel would leave, but I will wait until it is warmer and hopefully until after the birth of the little ones."	['amusing']
The husband's attitude towards his wife can be described as _ .	A boy was born to a couple after eleven years of marriage. They were a loving couple and loved the boy very much. When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work so he asked the wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. The mother, preoccupied in the kitchen, totally forgot the matter. The boy saw the bottle and playfully went to the bottle and, fascinated with its color, drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous medicine meant for adults in small dosages . When the child fell down, the mother hurried him to the hospital, where he died. The mother was shocked. She was terrified how to face her husband. When the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and uttered just four words. The husband just said 'I am with you, Darling'. The husband's totally unexpected reaction is active behavior. The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No point in attaching blame. She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was comfort and sympathy from the husband. That is what he gave her. If everyone can look at life with this kind of viewpoint, there would be much fewer problems in the world. Take off all your envies, unforgiveness, selfishness, and fears and you will find things are actually not as difficult as you think. Sometimes we spend time asking who is responsible or whom to blame, whether in a relationship, in a job or with the people we know. By this way we miss out some warmth in human relationship.

When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her father died only two years later. Attending a good school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905. Within 11 years Eleanor bore six children; one son died early. In Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. When he was stricken with polio in 1921, she took care of him devotedly. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. When Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House, she understood social conditions well and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She broke the tradition to hold conferences, and expressed her opinions. This made her a target for political enemies but her sincerity of purpose made her personally popular to many. As she had written: ""...if truth and loyalty are stamped upon her face, all will be attracted to her..."" After the President Roosevelt's death in 1945, she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters, ""The story is over."" Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokeswoman in the United Nations. She continued a positive career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband."	['politics']

Which of the following is true?	Americans have used colors to create many expressions they use every day. We say you're 'in the pink' when we are in good health. It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good. The color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'. Some people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money. Blue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful ( ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad. The color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money. If someone tells you to put someone 'in black and white', they want you to write it down.

If a driver drinks a glass of beer before driving in China, _	"On August 15, 2011,the Ministry Publish Security started a campaign to educate drivers about the dangers of driving after drinking. As a part of the campaign, police officers watched bars, restaurants and KTVs in Beijing, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei and Guangdong. It ended up on December 30. But it told the drivers the meaning of the new traffic laws and the dangers of drinking. In Beijing, some restaurants put up notices and told drivers about their responsibility. ""Usually if a group of guests come by car, the driver won't drink. If he does, we will remind him,"" said a waitress from Dongfang Restaurant in Beijing. Fewer drivers are drinking alcohol nowadays, since many know about the campaign. Wang Lankun, a traffic policeman in Beijing said, ""Some drivers think a glass of beer is not a problem. But a blood test will show that their blood-alcohol level is more than 20mg for each 100ml of blood, that is enough to affect their driving."" During the campaign, drivers who have a blood-alcohol level of over 20mg for each 100ml of blood will get a fine of 500 yuan. Also, they will not be allowed to drive for three months. In fact, there are strict laws to punish drunk driving in many other countries. For example, in the USA, if someone has a blood-alcohol level of over 80mg for each 100ml of blood, he will be sent to prison for one year. But in Britain, he will be fined 5,000 pounds and banned from driving for 12 months, also he will be sent to prison for 6 months. In Germany, if a driver has a blood-alcohol level of over 60mg for each 100ml of blood, he won't be allowed to drive until he passes a new driving test."

"The sentence in the blank in the last advice should be "" _ ""."	Children lie on couches or sit on floors, nearly hypnotized by all kinds of messages coming from the television. This scene has become all too familiar. Increasingly, young children are adopting a watching-TV lifestyle, at s stage in life when activity is important to their growth. Furthermore, family time is being destroyed by too much TV time. Here are some facts you need to know: *Research shows that children spend between five and six hours per day watching TV, and they go to bed before having any communication with other family members. *Time spent in front of a screen is reducing the amount of time children spend sleeping. *The more time a youth spends in front of a screen, the more likely he or she is to be overweight. Experts offer the following advice to parents on how to stop their children from becoming addicted to television: *Do not put a TV in a child's bedroom. *Make meal time, family time -----turn off the TV during a family meal time. Better yet, remove the TV from the eating area. *Make TV time active time by doing simple exercise during advertisement breaks. *Help your kids be clever TV watchers by teaching them to recognize a sales trick in advertisements . *Create family memories by planning fun activities instead of always watching TV with your family. * _ . Limit your own TV watching to less than two hours per day. The best way to learn is to follow; this is especially true for children.	['Be a good role model']

What does the author say about people's sleeping habits?	"Everybody sleeps, but what people stay up late to catch--or wake up early in order not to miss--varies by culture. From data collected, it seems the things that cause us to lose the most sleep, on average, are sporting events, time changes, and holidays. Around the world, people changed sleep patterns thanks to the start or end of daylight savings time. Russians, for example, began to wake up about a half-hour later each day after President Vladimir Putin shifted the country permanently to ""winter time""starting on October 36. Russia's other late nights and early mornings generally correspond to public holidays. On New Year's Eve, Russians have the world's latest bedtime, hitting the hay at around 3:30 am. Russians also get up an hour later on International Women's Day, the day for treating and celebrating female relatives. Similarly, Americans' late nights late mornings, and longest sleeps fall on three-day weekends. Canada got the least sleep of the year the night it beat Sweden in the Olympic hockey final. The World Cup is also chiefly responsible for sleep deprivation , The worst night for sleep in the U.K. was the night of the England-Italy match on June 15. Brits stayed up a half-hour later to watch it, and then they woke up earlier than usual the next morning thanks to summer nights, the phenomenon in which the sun barely sets in northern countries in the summertime. That was nothing, though, compared to Germans, Italians, and the French, who stayed up around an hour and a half later on various days throughout the summer to watch the Cup. It should be made clear that not everyone has a device to record their sleep patterns, in some of these nations, it's likely that only the richest people do. And people who elect to track their sleep may try to get more sleep than the average person. Even if that's the case, though, the above findings are still striking, If the most health-conscious among us have such deep swings in our shut-eye levels throughout the year, how much sleep are the rest of us losing?"

When will the party start?	"Mrs. Green is going to give a birthday party for Mary. Mary is her daughter. She is going to be ten years old. A lot of friends of Mary's are going to come to the party. There are twenty girls of them. Mrs. Green is getting ready for the party. Mrs. White is helping her. ""That's a big nice cake,"" Mrs. White says to Mrs. Green. ""Thank you very much."" Mrs. Green is going shopping now. She is going to buy fruit for the party. She buys lots of pears, apples, oranges and bananas. Then she goes home. It's five o'clock in the afternoon. Everything is ready. Now the first girl is arriving. The party is going to begin in thirty minutes."	['At half past five in the afternoon']
How does the writer describe the addicts' use of Internet?	"Do you know any people like these? They are part of a new addiction called Internet addiction.Internet addicts spend at least thirty to forty hours online every week.The use of the Internet can be an addiction like drug use.People lose control of the time they spend on the Internet. For example,one college student was missing for several days.His friends were worried,and they called the police.The police found the student in the computer lab, he was surfing the net for several days straight. Studies show that about 6% to 10% of Internet users become addicted.And people worry about the teens because the Internet is changing the playing field for some of them.They spend more time in cyberspace than in the real world of friends and family. Is ""surfing the net'' a hobby or an addiction for you? You may have a problem if you have these symptoms : *You do not go to important family activities or you do not do school work because you like to spend hours on the Internet. *You can't wait for your next online time. *You plan to spend a short time online,but then you spend several hours. *You go out with your friends less and less."

What dose Alan Rinzler suggest that children should do?	"The television news feature about Ben Heckmann, an eighth grader from Farmington, Minn, was breathless in its praise. ""At 14, he has accomplished something many adults can't achieve,"" the reporter said, ""Ben is a twice-published author."" But Ben's two ""Velvet Black"" books, describing a fictional rock band, were not picked from a pile of manuscripts by an eagle eyed publisher. They were self-published, at the cost of $400 by Ben's parents. Over the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a ""published author."" The mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player. But others see self-publishing as a lost opportunity to teach children about hardship and perseverance. Mr. Robbins, a critic, thinks it is wonderful to start writing at a young age, but worries self-publishing sends the wrong message. ""There are no prodigies in literature,"" he said. ""Literature requires experience, in a way that mathematics and music do not."" Alan Rinzler, a publishing industry veteran, suggested parents hire a professional editor like him to work with their child to tear a manuscript apart and help make a better. Ben's father, Ken, said Ben's ambitions ""weren't to knockHarry Potteroff the list,"" but ""to get that good feeling inside that you've done something."" Ajla Dizdarevic, 12, who has self-published two books of poetry, has been on television and in local newspapers. ""Being a published author,"" she said, ""was always a dream of mine."" Her new dream: three books by age 15."	['Be professionally guided']
"Keith Peiris insisted that he is ""just like any other kid"", which shows he is _ ."	"The 12-year-old CEO of a Web site design company will be one of 300 business and political leaders accompanying Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on a trade visit to China in March. Keith Peiris, who founded Cyberteks Design in June 1999 and now has 25 clients in North America, insisted in an interview that he is ""just like any other kid"". He and his father will spend nine days on the Team Canada trip to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, where Chretien aims to showcase the best of Canadian business in the most populous country in the world. A glance at the complex, elegant animations on his www. cyberteks, com site shows the extent of Peiris talent. ""He doesn't want to be No.2,"" his father Deepal said proudly. His father, who is now vice president of operations at Cyberteks, said ""I am teaching my son what I know. We make decisions together. I haven't done anything my son disagreed with. He makes the final decision."" The company has seven offices in the United States and five part - time employees who, like the Peiris family, work from their London homes. Keith Peiris admitted some potential clients change their minds when they learn his age, but the well- informed teenager tries to ignore them. ""suddenly, I've been called a whiz kid or geek, which I am not too happy about. A few people have asked if they should call me 'mister', but I stay casual, I am still a kid."""	['modest']
Which of the following is TRUE, according to the passage?	It is understandable that many of today's college graduates view themselves as the generation that opportunity forgot. This fall, I interviewed 85 recent graduates of various colleges to discuss their success in finding a job. Of those I interviewed ----many from famous schools ---- only five are in the career fields they prepared for; the rest are unemployed or in jobs that are temporary. Graduates with once-marketable degrees in accounting and computer science, for example, now compete with applicants who have five years of experience and will accept the same entry-level salary. Mainly because there too many applicants for too few jobs, employees are ignoring resumes that once commanded interviews. But in my work as a management consultant, I find that many executives also feel that recent graduates have contributed to a problem: that young people have been so pampered by their parents and are so untested academically that they bring little value to today's demanding workplace. Some of the least judgmental, most supportive managers I know are criticizing recent graduates for poor quality in their written and oral reports, and for difficulty in drawing essential facts from masses of data. Earlier generations faced this criticism as well, but employees flooded with resumes have now become far more selective than their predecessors . Among all the cruel talks about unemployment, little is said about the impact on the nation's future of a generation convinced that the workplace has little use for it. This generation must regain its confidence if they are to remain the birthplace of ideas, products and services that shape world. The quickest way to rebuild that confidence is to form partnerships between recent graduates and the companies that will employ them. Corporations, in turn, should consider investing in training and developing a generation they will eventually need. High-potential graduates for whom there isn't an immediate opening could be hired, not as unpaid interns but as salaried trainees given three to six months to prove their value in a series of assignments. Those who don't seize the opportunity can quickly be dismissed. Trainees should be given guidance to help them avoid the small missteps that can damage a career before it starts.

The purpose of the passage is _ .	Cooking programs and classes for children seem to positively influence children's food preferences and behaviors, according to a recent review. And, although the review didn't look at long-term effects of such programs, the findings suggest that such programs might help children develop long-lasting healthy habits. This research comes at a time when childhood obesity rates have been rising rapidly. More than one-third of adolescents in the United States were obese in 2012, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This trend has been caused, at least in part, by a significant decrease in the amount of meals that people consume at home since the 1980s, according to background information in the study. Cooking education programs, such as Food Explorers, teach children about new healthy foods and how to prepare them. They also stress the importance of eating five fruits and vegetables every day. A volunteer parent explains a new food to the group, and the kids make something based on the lesson, such as fruit or vegetable salad. Depending on the program, kids may be sent home with information about healthy foods to bring to their parents, the review explained. The study team reviewed eight other studies that tested different types of cooking education programs. Children in these classes were between 5 and 12 years old, according to the review. The goal of the study team was to learn more about developing an efficient program to encourage healthy food choices that last a lifetime. The study found that it is particularly important to expose kids to healthy foods on a number of occasions. This makes them feel comfortable with the new foods, which helps them build healthy habits. The study stressed the importance of getting parents involved in their children's eating habits. Parents who are unable to enroll their kids in a cooking class can achieve similar benefits by having their kids help them while they prepare meals at home. Children are more comfortable at home, which makes them more receptive to new foods because they will make the connection to a positive experience.	['to inform the reader']
According to the article,Mrs.Woolf _ .	There was one thing that I found rather strange on my first day as housekeeper at Monk'S House.The floors in the house were very thin.The bathroom was right above the kitchen,and when Mrs.Woolf was having her bath before breakfast,I could hear her talking to herself.on and on she went,talk,talk,and talk,asking questions and giving herself the answers.I thought there must be two or three people there with her.When Mr.Woolf saw that I looked surprised,he told me that Mrs.Woolf always said out loud the sentences that she had written during the night.She needed to know if they sounded fight and the bath was a good place for trying them out* I was not allowed to make coffee at Monk'S House--Mr.and Mrs.Woolf were very particular about coffee and always made it themselves--so Mr.Woolf came into the kitchen at eight o'clock every morning to make it.When we carried the breakfast to Mrs.Woolf's room,I noticed that she had always been working during the night.There were pencil and paper beside her bed so that when she woke up,she could work,and sometimes it seemed as though she had had very little sleep. Mrs.Woolf's bedroom was outside the house in the garden.I used to think how inconvenient it must be to have to go out in the rain to go to bed.Her bedroom had been connected to the back of the house:the door faced the garden and a window at the side opened out on to a field.Because the writing-room was small,Mr.Woolf had built a large one for her at the end of the garden against the church wall. I can always remember her coming to the house each day from the writing-room when I rang the bell for lunch at One O'clock.She used to come in,smoking one of her favourite cigarettes,which were bought by Mr.Woolf for her in London.She was tall and thin and very pretty.She had large eyes and a wide mouth.She wore long skirts-usually blue or brown-in the fashion of the day ,and silk jackets of the same colour Mrs.Woolf wore clothes that suited for her well.I ironed them for her and did any sewing that was necessary-She was not able to sew ,although sometimes she liked to try.There was one thing in the kitchen that Mrs.Woolf was very good at doing:she could make beautiful bread.

Which of the following do you think is the most important one to a polar researcher?	"The Chinese Antarctica expedition returned to Shanghai on March 20 following a month living on the ice. It was the first time Chinese scientists had visited the Amery Ice Shelf--the longest ice shelf in the world. The team collected ice samples and data on temperatures, which are necessary for research on global warming. So far, about 27 countries have visited Antarctica for scientific research. Although the living conditions are very hard, many scientists have to stay there for long periods of time. So, how do they manage their lives on the ice? Well, during the summer, the temperature in Antarctica reaches about-20degC. It falls to about-60degCin winter. So, even if there are 24 hours of sunshine, scientists must keep wearing all the correct clothes to protect them from the cold. These clothes include jeans, running shoes, jackets, long underwears, boots and woolen socks. Although highly technical clothing provides much protection against the extreme cold, scientists often need to go outside when there is an icy wind blowing and the temperature is-30degC. Natural protection such as facial hair can also help. ""That's why many researchers wear a beard. It really does keep you warm,""says German explorer Arved Fuchs. Usually, the polar researchers have good meals. Some even have feasts on holidays like Christmas and New Year's Day. Vegetables are always welcome and usually finished the quickest. Life on the ice means living with other researchers in tight living space. Most people sleep in dorm style rooms. More remote field camps use separate tents. So, at least some researchers don't have to _ annoying snorers . But what do they do for fun in their spare time? There are actually a lot of things they can do. They watch movies, read tons of books, listen to music, have saunas ,paint and ski. Some female researchers might even do some knitting. It is important for a polar researcher to be in good physical condition. They can be required to climb to heights of more than 3, 000 meters. And the Antarctic atmosphere has less oxygen than that of any other continent."	['Health.']
How many bananas did Bruce give his mother?	"The telephone rang when Mrs. Gates was cooking lunch. Her son Bruce went to answer the phone. His aunt said she was coming to see them with her daughter that afternoon. Mrs. Gates was happy because she hadn't seen her sister for several months. She knew the girl liked bananas very much, but she was busy in the kitchen and couldn't go to buy any for her. She gave some money to Bruce and said, ""Go and buy two kilos of bananas in the shop. "" Bruce liked bananas, too. He went out happily. Half an hour later he came back with a bag in his hand. Mrs. Gates weighed the bananas and found they were half a kilo short. She took the bag to the shopkeeper and said, ""I sent my little son for two kilos of bananas, but you gave him only one and a half kilos!"" ""Have you weighed your little son yet, madam?"" asked the shopkeeper, ""My scales are all right."""	['One and a half kilos.']
What does the writer want to tell us by writing this passage ?	"Every Wednesday, I go to Cantata Adult Life Services, a local retirement community in Brookfield, Illinois, US, with my classmates to do community service. After my very first visit to Cantata, my life changed forever. That may sound a bit dramatic, but volunteering with the elderly has changed my views on life. Our visits last about an hour, and we bring 25-30 students every time. We play board games and cards with the residents while we're there. You can watch all the movies and TV shows you want about ""life back then"", but nothing compares to talking to the people who were actually there. Just hearing their stories has touched me in a way I never thought possible. Whether it was talking to 98-year-old ""Hurricane Hilda"" about her glory days as a roller skater or chatting with Lou about the times she danced with a famous actor, I was completely attracted by every single memory the residents wanted to share with me. Even the residents who don't have amazing memories make the experience satisfying . I remember visiting Mrs Robinson. She couldn't recall much about her past, but she told me she'd never forget how kind I was just to listen to her ""rambling "". It made me realize that it's the little things that make life worth living. That's something I won't forget anytime soon. If there's one thing I've realized in my three years of visiting Cantata, it's that presence - just being there - means more than anything to many of the residents. And despite how busy our lives are, there's always time to make someone's day. For me, it feels great to be a source of happiness, a smile on a bad day or a listening ear for old memories. And at the end of the day, that's all that matters. It's easy to feel like you don't have anything in common with the elderly - especially when you're a teenager. But that's not true at all. I hate to be overly cliched here, but age really is just a number. As young adults, it's important for us to realize this sooner rather than later. We can learn a lot from the elderly, and they can often benefit from teenagers too."	['Young adults and the elderly can benefit from each other.']
The writer wrote the passage to _	"At school, besides cheating on a test, a kid might cheat in other ways. They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a ""good reason"" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK. There's an old saying that cheaters never win and winners never cheat. This may sound difficult to understand, because sometimes it seems like cheaters do win--- at least for the moment. However, sooner or later, they'll pay the price. It's just a matter of time only. And kids who don't cheat are true winners because, when they win, they do it honestly."	['tell kids not to cheat.']
According to Wilson, what John should do first is to _ .	Wilson, At college, when I try speaking with anyone, I just feel very nervous. I have no trouble talking when I'm alone. However, when I talk with others, my voice sounds different, and sometimes there is a pause between each word I pronounce. Sometimes I can't pronounce a word even with my own family members. My voice becomes deeper and sounds totally different than it usually does. Can you please give me some good advice? John John, If you have trouble pronouncing words, simply accept the fact. Many other readers have such experiences, and so do I. You don't need to get stressed about it. You are apparently getting nervous because you feel like you are under some pressure when speaking to other people. Take your time and don't worry about pauses. Speak slowly, opening your mouth to enunciate your words clearly. Listen to powerful leaders on the television and note that they speak slowly and carefully and learn to master their speaking techniques. When you speak to others in college, try to ask questions that will get the other person to talk. Listening carefully and then filling in during the conversation takes the pressure off you and you will feel more relaxed when you talk. You make more of an impression when you are interested in what the other person is saying than when you try to lead a conversation. Remember that the more you worry about how your voice sounds, about pronouncing words and about pauses, the worse it gets. So accept the way you speak now and relax in your conversations. I hope these ideas can help take the pressure off you when you talk to other people. Wilson	['accept his weakness']
That the jaguar always lying in its cave leaves people an impression that _ .	"Jaguar was very rare. It was said that there less than 20 jaguars in the world, one of which was living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to help this jaguar, Peruvians set up a zoo for it, where there were sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. However, strange enough, no one had ever seen the jaguar hunt the deer and sheep. What they could see was its lying in its cave, sleeping and eating the meat provided by the zoo keepers. At first, people thought that the jaguar felt too lonely, so they found a female tiger to accompany it. However, it did not make too much sense. The jaguar just sometimes went out of its cave with its ""girlfriend"" for a while before it came back to its house again' It is normal for the jaguar to be lazy here. Tiger is the king of forest but you simply put some small animals around him. That is why the jaguar shows no interest in going out' a visitor said. So people put five wolves into the jaguar's zoo. Since then, the jaguar did not go back to its cave any more . It either stands on top of the hill yelling or runs up and down the hill without sleeping all day long . Actually, one creature without any _ is a lifeless creature. If a man lives without rivals, he is likely to be satisfied with the present and will not fight for the better. He will hold back before all difficulties . Hard environment tends to make successful people . Therefore, we need some rivals to push us to go ahead in all difficulties and competitions in our lives.

40. It can be inferred from the passage that the author's attitude towards the new trend in banking is _ .	"My father's reaction to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: ""You won't catch me putting my money in there!"" he declared, ""Not in that glass box!"" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I am convinced that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Consequently, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to affirm the fact, however untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building's design made it appear impenetrable , the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol reflected people's prevailing attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Excepting pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a has largely been replaced by credit. A deficit economy, accompanied by huge expansion, has led us to think of money as product of the creative imagination. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable element is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture boasts of imaginative powers. From this point of view it is hard to say where architecture ends and human assertion begins."	['positive']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Visitors to _ and _ , above, helped make New York City the country's favorite tourist destination last year. (Photo By Henny Ray Abrams/Associated Press) ks*5*u Associated Press-----The number of visitors to New York City fell last year for the first time since 2001, but falls in tourism elsewhere across the United States made it the most popular destination in the country for the first time in almost two decades, tourism officials said on Monday. Mayor Michael R. Bloombergpainted the 3.9 percent drop -- an estimated 45.3 million visitors -- as a victory, saying that during the recession the city had expected losing as much as 10 percent of its tourists. The city expects to recover most of the loss this year and remains on track to hit its long-standing goal of 50 million yearly visitors by 2012, the mayor said. ""We have made our city cleaner, safer and more exciting than ever,"" Bloomberg said at a news conference at a Brooklyn restaurant. ""I do think we'll continue to see even more tourists on our streets as the economy improves, and I think that we'll continue to develop better than other cities."" Though many travelers stayed home simply because money was tight, the reducing number in international visitors could result from swine flu fears and concerns over border security measures, Bloomberg said. Still, the Statue of Liberty, which reopened its crown to tourists, reported a jump in the number of visitors. So did other New York City attractions. And the city's entertainment and hotel industry -- which provides one-tenth of the city's private jobs -- actually grew in 2009. ""The lodging industry really is using discounting to motivate demand,"" he said, adding that the price drops have importantly _ ""the city's ability to keep the level of tourism that it's had."""

What does the writer think of the reporter?	Open Letter to an Editor I had an interesting conversation with a reporter recently -- one who works for you. In fact, he's one of your best reporters. He wants to leave. Your reporter gave me a copy of his resume and photocopies of six stories that he wrote for you. The headlines showed you played them proudly. With great enthusiasm, he talked about how he finds issues, approaches them, and writes about them, which tells me he is one of your best. I'm sure you would hate to lose him. Surprisingly, your reporter is not unhappy. In fact, he told me he really likes his job. He has a great assignment , and said you run a great paper. It would be easy for you to keep him, he said. He knows that the paper values him. He appreciates the responsibility you've given him, takes ownership of his profession, and enjoys his freedom. So why is he looking for a way out? He talked to me because he wants his editors to demand so much more of him. He wants to be pushed, challenged, coached to new heights. The reporter believes that good stories spring from good questions, but his editors usually ask how long the story will be, when it will be in, where it can play, and what the budget is. He longs for conversations with an editor who will help him turn his good ideas into great ones. He wants someone to get excited about what he's doing and to help him , exploring the best ways to report it. He wants to be more valuable for your paper. That's what you want for him, too, isn't it? So your reporter has set me thinking. Our best hope in keeping our best reporters, copy editors, photographers, artists -- everyone -- is to work harder to make sure they get the help they are demanding to reach their potential. If we can't do it, they'll find someone who can.	['Ambitious.']
Which of the following is probably the best title?	School children are using mobile phone applications to do their homework, which seem to beincreasing during summer vacations. But instead of blaming students for their behavior, we should say noto too much homework. This is important because by using mobile phone applications to do theirhomework, students don't add much to their knowledge, says an article in Guangzhou-based YangchengEvening News. Excerpts : Using mobile phone applications to do homework is no different from copying from someone else'swork. This is the opinion of a vast majority of teachers. Students who seek cell phone apps help to do theirhomework will pay dearly during major exams when they cannot seek the help of such applications, theteachers say. The heavy load of homework Chinese students are burdened with, said to be the heaviest in the world,has led to the popularity of these applications. Senior high school students in China rarely go to bed before 11 pm. A report in Shanghai published in2013 showed that students in the city on average spend 28.2 hours in class every week, the 9th highestamong 65 countries and regions surveyed. Also, they spend an average of 13.8 hours a week doinghomework, most in the world. There is no association between the amount of homework one does and the amount of knowledge onegathers. In fact, a research by Australian experts shows that the result is exactly the opposite: the morehours students spend doing homework, the less effective they will be in gaining knowledge. The United States is one of the countries where students do little homework, but that has not damagedthe country's academic status in the world. So, it's time Chinese schools understood this fact and freed students of the unnecessary burden ofhomework.	['Free kids of the burden of homework.']

According to the manual, each participating student of PISA should _ .	Thank you for agreeing to be a Test Administrator for PISA. The purpose of this manual is to help you to understand how you will assist with the successful implementation of this large-scale student survey. 1.1. What is PISA? PISA stands for the Programme for International Student Assessment, sponsored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). PISA 2015 is the sixth PISA study that has been conducted since 2000 and involves more than 70 participating countries. PISA has the following characteristics: * It is the world's largest international survey in education. * It surveys students aged about 15 years. * It assesses students' preparedness for adult life. Undertaking PISA is important because the results of the test can be used: * to indicate how well prepared students in a country/economy are for learning once they leave school; * to identify areas for improvement over time by schools, education systems, and governments; and * to allow a comparison of student performance and the learning environment between different countries. 1.2. Components of PISA 2015 * 1.2.1. Cognitive test 42 students from each school will be randomly sampled to complete a 2-hour computer-based test consisting of questions in science, mathematics, reading, and Collaborative Problem Solving. * 1.2.2. Questionnaires These students will also be asked to complete a 30 minutes Student Questionnaire on the computer either directly after the test sections or at a later time. * 1.2.3. Financial Literacy assessment After the cognitive test and questionnaires, a sub-sample of 10-11 students will take a computer-based Financial Literacy(FL) assessment. The 65-minute Financial Literacy assessment tests students' knowledge of personal finances and their ability to apply it to their financial problems.	['carry out all the tasks on the computer']
How does the writer like the ads in the newspapers or magazines?	"There are about fifteen hundred languages in the world. But only a few of them are very important. English is one of them. Many, many people use it, not only in England and the USA, but also in other parts of the world. About 200,000,000 people speak it as their own language. It is difficult to say how many people are learning it as a foreign language. Many millions of people are trying to do so. Is it easy or difficult to learn English? Different people may have different answers. Have you ever noticed ads of this kind in the newspapers or magazines? ""Learn English in six weeks, or give your money back..."" ""Easy and funny..."" ""Our records and tapes help you master English in a month"". Of course, it never happened quite like that. The only language that seems easy to learn is the mother tongue. We should remember that we all learned our own language well when we were children. If we could learn English in the same way, it would not seem so difficult. Think of what a small child does. He listens to what people say. He tries what he hears. So it is hard to say that learning English is easy. We must do a lot of practice. And practice needs great efforts and takes much time. Good teachers, record, tapes, books, and dictionaries will be helpful, but they cannot do the student's work for him."	['It never happened quite like what the ads said.']
What is the main idea of the text?	"In ancient Egypt the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace if he brought good news.However if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was cut off. Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations.Once, a friend and I packed up some peanut butter and sandwiches for an outing.As we walked light-heartedly out of the door picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said, ""Oh boy, bad day for a picnic.The weatherman says it's going to rain."" I wanted to strike him on the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches.Not for his stupid weather report, but for his smile. Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus.As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile, ""Oh, that bus left five minutes ago."" _ ! It's not the news that makes someone angry.It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered.Everyone must give bad news from time to time and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude.A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way.A boss informing an employee he didn't get the job takes on a sympathetic tone.Big winners know when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this.When you're tired from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn't ready yet? When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece? It makes you, as traveler or diner, want to land your fist right on their unsympathetic faces. Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning.Had the Greyhound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said ""Oh that's all right.I'll catch the next one."" When they bear bad news, big winners deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded person is sure to have"	['Delivering bad news properly is important in communication.']
A primary school in Fuzhou required the students to _ .	Students at a primary school in Fuzhou, Hast China's Fujian Province were required to clean the school toilets to help them develop good habits. But some parents are strongly against the idea. They can't see the advantages of students doing such chores . They think that the school should provide students with a proper education, not the chance to be school cleaners. In fact, parents, schools and society play an equally important role in developing the character of students. It is good for schools to give students such tasks,because few of the students will do them at home. Their parents want them to do homework only. In recent years, some parents will _ when students are asked to do some chores in schools. Some complain about the teachers if their kids get hurt in schools; some even challenge the schools' teaching methods and management. As a result, many primary schools, especially those in big cities, do not let students join in outdoor activities during breaks, fearing that they might get hurt. This is bad for the development of students' best qualities. What the primary school in Fuzhou is doing is worth praising. Doing chores can put a sense of responsibility into students' minds and teach them the spirit of rules as well as teamwork. Also, it can make students' in-school experiences more meaningful.

"When I was 16 years old,I made my first visit to the United States.It wasn't the first time I had been abroad.Like most English children I also learned French at school.And I had often been to France,so I was used to speaking a foreign language to people who didn't understand English.But when I went to America I was really looking forward to having a nice easy holiday without any language problems. How wrong I was! The misunderstanding began at the airport.I was looking for a public telephone to give my friend Danny a call and tell her that I had arrived.A friendly old man saw me looking lost and asked if he could help me.

But recently, some people have been much more concerned with how the grizzly bear and mountain lion can cross the road. Millions of animals die each year on US roads, the Federal Highway Administration reports. In fact, only about 80 ocelots , an endangered wild cat exist in the US today. The main reason? Road kill. ""Ecopassages"" may help animals cross the road without being hit by cars. They are paths both over and under roads. ""These ecopassages can be extremely useful, so that wildlife can avoid human conflicts,"" said Jodi Hilty of the Wildlife Conservation Society. But do animals actually use the ecopassages? The answer is yes. Paul Beier of Northern Arizona University found foot marks left by mountain lions on an ecopassage that went under a highway. This showed that the lion used the passage. Builders of some ecopassages try to make them look like a natural part of an area by planting trees on and around them. Animals seem _ .

Which of the following is true?	"It's important to learn about protecting our environment. Here is a 5R rule for us: 1. Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2. Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3. Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4. Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5. Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away. If you want to change for better ones, It is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair. It is true that North America is a ""throw-away"" society . But the time has come to change our way of life so that we can protect our environment. Every one of us should try our best."

From the text, we can know _ .	"It was a painful 100 hours from the moment the earthquake struck until rescuers pulled Liu Deyun from the ruins of a factory yesterday. When he went to work on Monday morning, he had never thought that he would spend the next week in the ruins of his workplace. ""It was a miracle , but that happened through our hard work,"" said Zhao Hongxing, an army doctor who joined in rescue. ""His first words were 'The army is great. '"" Chinese troops may have been the ones to physically free Mr Liu, 50, but it was his daughter who didn't give up looking for her father that saved his life at last. On Thursday night, running around the fallen factory, the family search party headed by his daughter, heard a low cry. ""Father! Father!"" Mr Liu answered in a low voice ""Yes"". Then, after more than three days buried under the fallen building, came two simple words: ""I'm thirsty"". The reply was probably not what he was wanting: ""Father don't talk! You need your air! I will go and find somebody to rescue you!"" The entire first floor of the building fell down, with the second floor completely damaged and pushing the building to one side. The 12-hour rescue operation to save Mr Liu was filled with danger. Mr Liu was freed yesterday at 6:28 p. m. His family had agreed to cut off one of his feet so that he could be pulled out. ""I just want him to live,"" his daughter Yuan, 23, said in tears. Mr Liu, wrapped in a blanket, was welcomed by a large number of people who was concerned about him. And with the latest survivor taken to a waiting ambulance , the rescue workers went back to the ruins where two more factory workers were waiting for their turn to be dug out."

How may you feel if you're subhealthy?	If you often feel tired and the doctor can't find anything wrong with you, you may be in a state of subhealth . Subhealth is a state between health and illness. Most of the subhealthy people are middle-aged ones who are usually stressed out because of work and family. And some of them are students who are having exams. If you are subhealthy, it is not difficult for you to become well soon. You should have good living habits. For example, you should get up early and go to bed early. And you should exercise regularly . Exercising can keep you healthy. As for meals, it is better to eat less salt and sugar. Vegetables, fruit and fish are important to your body. You should eat more of them. It is not good to eat too much at one meal, because it may cause unhealthy changes in the digestive tract .

The inspiration of the Apiary Fund's business concept comes from .	According to the Small Business Association, more than 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years. This is not the case for Apiary Fund CEO, Shawn Lucas. Shawn has grown a very successful business focusing on teaching people how to trade foreign currencies. The Apiary Fund not only gives their traders some of the best Forex education possible but also gives their traders money to trade with. The Apiary Fund had a slow start but has now become a company that recently hit $1 billion in trader volume . The Apiary Fund's success has come from the great business concept, and work ethic . * Business Concept The Apiary Fund has a very special but effective business concept, which Shawn Lucas discovered many years ago. You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China. During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified . Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund. * Work Ethic The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business. The Apiary Fund became successful from hard work and devotion. This hard work and devotion has recently brought the Apiary Fund to hit a trading volume high of $1 billion. Shawn Lucas believes that by the end of this year the Apiary Fund can expect to see double or triple that volume. The company has experienced immense growth by making a few changes to their program structure, which has since increased growth by about five times within the last year. Successful businesses are hard to start, but with a good business concept and great work ethic anything is possible. Shawn and the Apiary Fund are a great example of both.	['a Chinese company']

Happy and her husband Ben, 70, have a huge garden. They spent many happy hours together working on it. Most of the neighbors watched interestingly as Ben doubled the size of their garden. As the cost of food climbed faster than Ben's beans, we all wished we also had such a large garden. As the rest of us spent our dollars at the market, Happy could be seen picking beans in her back yard. Last month, Happy and Ben invited most of the neighborhood over for an ""all-day food feast"". We were told to bring gloves and arrive very early in the morning. We didn't know what was about to take place. By 9:00 am, there were nine of us in the garden picking tomatoes, beans, okra, and squash. By 10:00 am, there was lots of laughter. We shared a lot of stories. By five o'clock, everyone was a little drunk from the wine and beer. After dinner, we played games. As we were leaving, Happy and Ben handed each of us a shopping bag filled with the bounty of the day, already packaged and frozen. What a delightful gift! Well, the point wasn't so much about the food. The true gift was a day of friends enjoying one another's company . None of it would have happened if it had been for Happy and Ben's garden. Now they have a blog about gardening in case we decided to plant a garden. And I am so proud of my tomato plants!"	['are a generous and warm-hearted couple']

The writer went into the station coffee shop to _ .	"Last Friday, after doing all the family shopping in town I wanted a rest before catching the train, so I bought a newspaper and some chocolate and went into the station coffee shop. It was a cheap self-service place with long table to keep a place and went to get a cup of coffee. When I came back with the coffee, there was someone in the next seat. It was one of those wild-looking boys, with dark glasses and old clothes, and his hair was colored bright red at the front. What did surprise me was that he'd started to eat my chocolate. I was rather uneasy about him, but I didn't want to make more trouble. I just looked down at the front page of the newspaper, tasted my coffee and took a bit of chocolate. The boy looked at me closely. Then he took a second piece of chocolate. I could hardly believe it. Still I didn't say anything to him. When he took a third piece, I felt angrier. I thought, well, I shall have the last piece. ""And I got it."" The boy gave me a strange look, and then stood up. As he left he shouted out, ""There is something wrong with the woman,"" Everybody looked at me, but it was worse then I finished my coffee and got ready to leave. My face turned red when I knew I'd made a mistake. I wasn't my chocolate that I had eaten. There was mine, just under my newspaper."	['take a short rest']
According to the passage, which kind of music can relax ourselves from a long day's work?	Have you ever thought about why malls, restaurants, and even theaters have music? Well, to understand this, you simply just look back at how you felt when you heard music in these places. Music is known to improve the mood of people. Often music helps us pay attention to what we are doing. Music helps patients feel good and helps them recover faster and better. Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point of time. There are some periods in our life when everything seems difficult. It seems that everything is getting worse and we have no control over our life. Studies have shown that music can be an important mood lifter in such situations. Music also plays a great role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often cause loss of sleep and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language another person is speaking, but most of us respond to music in the same way. Music can often be the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your moods, but this can depend largely on the kind of music you listen to. While happy music can certainly make you feel better, sad music can further lower your spirits. Listening to classical music can often make you feel a lot more powerful, while soft music can be the perfect way to relax at the end of a long way. If you want to use music to change the way how you are feeling, you need to understand the role of it, learn to recognize the kind of music that lifts your mood and helps you feel better. Once you realize the kind of music you can use, you can use it to change the way you feel. The right kind of music can be the perfect way to help us feel happier.	['Soft music.']
The purpose of the text is to _ .	"Newborns begin to develop language skills long before they begin speaking. And, compared to adults, they develop these skills more quickly. People have a hard time learning new languages as they grow older, but babies have the ability to learn any language easily. For a long time, scientists have tried to explain how such young children can learn the complicated grammatical rules and sounds of a language. Now, researchers are getting a better idea of what's happening in the brains of the tiniest language learners. This new information might help kids with learning problems as well as adults who want to learn new languages. It might even help scientists who are trying to design computers that can communicate like people do. Most babies go ""ma ma"" by 6 months of age, and most children speak in full sentences by age 3. For many years, scientists have wondered how the brains of young children figure out how to communicate using language. With help from new technologies, scientists are now finding that babies begin life with the ability to learn any language. They get into contact with other people, listen to what they say and watch their movements very closely. That is why they quickly master the languages they hear most often. Studies show that, up to about 6 months of age, babies can recognize all the sounds that make up all the languages in the world. Starting at around 6 months old a baby's brain focuses on the most common sounds it hears. Then, children begin responding only to the sounds of the language they hear the most. In a similar way older babies start recognizing the patterns that make up the rules of their native language. For example, English children who are about 18 months old start to figure out that words ending in ""-ing"" or ""-ed"" are usually verbs, and that verbs are action words."	['inform']
Why do British people like telling lies, according to the spokesman for One Poll?	"Britain's most popular lie has been disclosed, with one in four people admitting using ""sorry I had no signal"" when returning a missed mobile phone call, a survey found. Researchers found the average Briton tells on average four lies every day or almost 1500 every year. Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the ""ignore"" button when their mobile rang. Three quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men. The second most common _ is ""I haven't got any cash on me"" when asked for money by beggars and Big Issue sellers. ""Nothing's wrong - I'm fine"" came third followed by ""You look lovely"" and ""Nice to see you"". Modern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with ""I didn't get your text"" in 18th, ""Our server was down"" in 20th and ""My battery died"" in 26th place. Other lies to make the top ten included ""I'll give you a ring"", ""We're just good friends"" and ""We'll have to meet up soon"". ""I'm on my way"" and ""No, your bum doesn't look big in that"" completed the top ten. In many cases perhaps it is better to delight someone with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults. He added: 'As a nation we just like trying to be nice and not upsetting people. Often little white lies can cover what we actually want to say. Most of these were considered completely harmless. '"	['Because British people are very considerate.']
Which section of a newspaper is the source of the passage?	"Four days after Dad's 67thbirthday, he had a heart attack. Luckily, he survived. But something inside him had died. His enthusiasm for life was gone. He refused to follow doctor's orders, and his sour attitude made everyone upset when they visit him. Dad was left alone. So I asked Dad to come to live with me on my small farm, hoping the fresh air would help him adjust. Within a week after he moved in, I regretted the invitation. He criticized everything I did. I became frustrated. Something had to be done. One day I read an article which said when given dogs, depressed patients would be better off. So I drove to the animal shelter that afternoon. As soon as I got there, a pointer's eyes caught my attention. They watched me calmly. A staff member said: ""He got here two weeks ago and we've heard nothing. His time is up tomorrow."" I turned to the man in horror. ""You mean you're going to kill him?"" ""Ma'am,"" he said gently. ""We don't have room for every unclaimed dog."" The police's calm brown eyes awaited my decision. ""I'll take him,"" I said. I drove home with the dog on the front seat beside me. I was helping it out of the car when Dad walked onto the front porch. ""Look what I got you!"" I said excitedly. Dad wrinkled his face. ""I don't want it,"" he muttered, turning back towards the house. Then, suddenly, the dog pulled free from my grasp. He sat down in front of my Dad. Dad's anger melted, and soon he was hugging the dog. This was the beginning of a warm friendship. Dad named the dog Cheyenne. Together they spent long hours walking down dusty lanes and relaxing on the banks of streams. Dad's bitterness faded, and he and Cheyenne went on to make many friends. Then, late one night two years later, I felt Cheyenne's cold nose burrowing through my bed covers. He had never before come into my bedroom at night. I ran into my father's room and found that he had passed away. Two days later, my shock and grief deepened when I discovered Cheyenne lying dead beside Dad's bed. As I buried him near their favorite stream, I silently thanked the dog for restoring Dad's peace of mind."	['Friends']
What's the best title of the passage?	"When my mother was alive, she used to tell me again and again about the value of just being nice. ""Never underestimate the power of a smile,"" she would say. I fear she would be very disappointed looking at the world today. A lot of people don't smile and when it comes to service today, they're just not nice. Now don't give me wrong, not all service workers but a good many. I was on the phone the other day with a computer help desk. First a man, then later a woman, who couldn't have been ruder. And this to a customer, who didn't know his way around a PC. But no matter, I could tell they thought I was a bother, The woman, in fact, seemed to be chewing gum as she unemotionally clicked off a series of commands for me to perform. The next day I heard from a friend of mine who got a performance review without his boss once looking up at him. Not once. You see it everywhere. Gone are the days when people cared about you. It's a sign of the time, I suspect. But that makes me sad -- for them and for us all. People who aren't happy, who don't smile, who don't kid, who don't joke or make light of even bad situations, make for an even worse situation. And it spreads like a cancer. Someone's rude to you, you're rude to them and to the next fellow you meet, and on and on. Smiles are contagious but so annoyances. The boss who can't be bothered with his workers. The celebrity who can't be bothered with her annoying fans. You know, my mom used to judge presidential candidates by how they smiled. I would say, ""But mom, you don't know if that smile is real."" ""Oh, yes I do,"" she would tell me. ""I can feel it."" It's in their eyes, she would say. And it's in their smile. The rest just kind of falls into place."	['The power of a smile']
What is the passage mainly about?	"Hundreds of great books are published in America every year. And every year, editors, critics and other readers try to choose a list of favorites. A few books showed up on list after list of the best fiction from this year. One of them was Ann Patchett's State of Wonder. Publishers Weekly described the novel as one "" _ ."" The story centers on a drug researcher from Minnesota named Maria Singh. She travels to Brazil to investigate the death of a co-worker. Her search takes her deep into the Amazon area and danger. But she also goes deep into her own soul for a close look at who she is, what she has lost in her life and how she wants the future to look. Ann Patchett lives in Tennesee. She told Publishers Weekly magazine that the state is dense and leafy, like the Amazon jungle. She visited that area while doing research for the novel. Chad Harbach's name was also all over the critics' best lists this year for his first book, The Art of Fielding. The New Yorker magazine praised the novel for the easy way it joins a love of baseball with a love of literature. The book is about a college baseball star. He suffers a mental crisis and begins to fail on the playing field as a result. But the book is about much more than the sport of baseball. It also is a story of love, loss, friendship and growing up. Chad Harbach says his own upbringing influenced the book. The Marriage Plot also got a lot of attention this year. It is the third book from Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Eugenides. He spent almost ten years writing it. The Marriage Plot is also a story about becoming an adult. It follows the lives of three students in their final year of college and beyond. Leonard struggles with manic depression, Mitchell, with religious belief and Madeleine struggles with her feelings for both men."	['The introduction of three well reviewed books.']
In order to effectively cope with the emergency, the most important is that _ .	Environmental health is defined as the control of the factors in the environment that may have harmful effects on people's physical, mental, or social well-being . Because natural disasters expose people to danger by bringing up or threatening their immediate environment, effective management of environmental health after a natural disaster is of great importance. The environmental health measures that must be considered after a natural disaster include the supply of appropriate shelter for individuals or groups of people left homeless, the distribution of safe and accessible water, and the protection and distribution of safe food products and so on. To effectively manage environmental health during and after a disaster, it is important that a state of preparation is in effect before the event actually occurs. During an emergency, success largely depends on making good, rapid judgment and appropriate response measures. High-level decision makers, therefore, must be familiar with sound measures beforehand and should be given an accurate judgment of the disaster's specific effects as quickly as possible. This book is intended to serve as a guide for those who may be called upon to make emergency decisions after disaster strikes. The recommended environmental health measures have been listed in the order of priority in which they should be taken during an emergency. However, each natural disaster is unique in the degree or type of emergency. In response to any given disaster, decision makers may find it necessary to change the priority assigned to any particular measure.	['we should be well prepared for it in advance']
Which of the following statements is true?	Wherever life takes you after A-level results day, it's likely to bring increased independence. That means it's time to take care of yourself. Students, take note. When you arrive at university, make sure you register with a doctor near your term-time address. If there is a university doctor at your institution, they will be your best choice. If not, ask student services for a recommendation. Once registered, do everything you can to make sure you never have to pay them a visit. Don't take unnecessary health risks. Cook meat thoroughly. Throw food away if it's out of date. Clean up after yourself. Food poisoning can be harmful, but it's easy to avoid if you pay due care and attention. University often brings a certain lifestyle, and while that's usually a whole lot of fun, it can quickly tip into a whole lot of sorrow. Know your limits when it comes to alcohol. Habitual drinking can be dangerous, and while every student will have nights of excess, these should be the exception, not the norm. Look out for your friends, too. If you're worried about alcohol or substance abuse, visit alcoholics-anonymous.org.ukorukna.orgfor free and confidential support. Anyone living with teenagers and young adults, especially in environments such as halls of residence, must accept that germs will be shared. Bugs and colds will spread like wildfire. Living communally brings certain health risks, and _ is probably the most serious of these. Symptoms include a rash, stiff neck and an aversion to bright lights. It's rare, but seek immediate medical attention if you're concerned (meningitis.org). Gappers, meanwhile, may need to consider specific health risks. If you're planning a trip abroad, especially in rural areas of poor countries, make sure you get the necessary vaccinations in good time before you leave. Research these at www.netdoctor.co.uk. You should be able to get everything you need from your doctor, although you may have to give them notice and you may have to pay, even on the NHS . If you also need to take medication while you're away, such as anti-malarials, do it faithfully. On a general note, whoever you are, wherever you are and whatever you do with your time, never walk alone at night, especially in quiet and badly lit areas. Always carry your phone. Never get in an unlicensed cab. Be careful who you trust. Respect your new independence, and keep yourself safe.	['Students are allowed to take medication even when they are away.']

The author feels fearful that she will be of no use to society mainly because _ .	I used to think education was the most important thing in my life. Recently my attitude has begun to change, although I still hold that it is _ for everyone in the world today. As a top junior student in my college, I was asked to make a speech on how to learn English well. Standing in front of the audience and facing so many freshmen, I was trembling. I didn' t remember any word that I had prepared. I ran out of the conference room without finishing my speech, leaving everyone puzzled. I cried that night in my room, feeling that I was a loser. Studying takes up so much of my time that I feel unable to really develop myself. I am just storing knowledge, yet I fail to communicate with others. I have received many awards in school, but they don't necessarily reflect anything about me. I don't know how to socialize. When I leave school I fear I will be of no use to society. I realize that everyone has his own way of living. I want to change my lifestyle. Of course I will keep studying. Yet I plan to look for a part-time job, which might turn out to be a good chance to get to know society. I still believe that working my hardest makes me happy. I will still stay on in college. But I will not allow it to shelter me from the real world.	['she does not know how to communicate with others']
Which of the following is the best title of the text?	"King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted ""kings don't give up the throne , they die in their sleep."" But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyles? The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarized, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above mere politics and symbolize a spirit of national unity. It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs continuing popularity as heads of state. And so, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch- filled region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). Most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure. Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history and sometimes the way they behave today symbolizes outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is strange that wealthy noble families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states. The most successful monarchies try their best to abandon or hide their old noble ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media interference makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image."

When a cat arches its back high in a rigid curve, it shows that it is _ .	"Body language is a very powerful tool of communication, not only between people but in the animal world as well. In many instances, we produce idioms (,)which are all understandable by borrowing examples from animal communication. For example, we know that a frightened cat will arch its back high in rigid curve . From this starting-point we might hear the expression, ""He gets my back up!"" meaning ""He makes me angry."" In the same manner, we know that many animals, if challenged by attackers, will not turn and run away because this will encourage the attacker to attack them more forcefully. Instead, they will move backwards slowly to get out of harm's way, always still facing their attacker.We call this action "" _ "" and it can be used just as well with humans as with animals. In the case of humans, however, the back-off may not be physical but oral, as in using a kinder tone of voice and gentler words instead of fighting against the attackers."	['frightened']
"""What is your zodiac animal?"" is a question used to find out a person's _ ."	"What is your zodiac animal? According to the Chinese lunar calendar , 12 animals mark 12 different years. It is the basis of the Chinese zodiac. Nowadays, Chinese zodiac animals have worldwide fame and are increasingly popular among western people. The zodiac is an important part of Chinese culture. People believe that the characteristics of a zodiac animal influence the personality of every person born in that year. For example, people born in the Year of the Tiger are considered powerful and brave. Zodiac animals also have some social functions. When people think it is not proper to ask: ""How old are you"", they may change their question to ""What is your zodiac animal?"" With this question, you can figure out roughly which year someone was born and the person's age. Zodiac animals are not special to China. Many countries share a similar zodiac culture with China. For example, in the Japanese Zodiac, a wild boar takes the place of a pig and the Vietnamese zodiac has a cat instead of a rabbit. But have you ever wondered how these 12 animals were chosen to represent each year? According to legend, the Jade Emperor invited all the animals to join him for Chinese New Year. Only 12 animals went to see him. As a reward he named a year after each one in the order they arrived. The ox would have been the first to arrive, but the rat sat on his back and jumped off just before they arrived to come in first place."	['age']
What's the main purpose of the passage?	"A different sort of _ is developing in the workplace. Someone --- specifically the father-daughter team of Larry and Meagan Johnson --- has figured out that on some American job sites, five generations are working side by side. In their new book about generations in the workplace the pair argue that while such an age difference adds a lot of texture and a variety of life experiences, it can also bring tensions and conflicts. The Johnsons are human-resource trainers and public speakers. Dad Larry is a former health-care executive; daughter Meagan is a onetime high-level sales manager. Here are the oldest and youngest of the five generations they identify: They call the oldest group Traditionals, born before 1945. They were heavily influenced by the lessons of the Great Depression and World War Two. They respect authority, set a high standard of workmanship, and communicate easily and confidently. But they're also stubbornly independent. They want their opinions heard. At the other extreme are what the Johnsons call Linksters, born after 1995 into today's more complicated, multi-media world. They live and breathe technology and are often social activists. You won't find many 15-year olds in the offices of large companies, except as volunteers, of course, but quite old and quite young workers do come together in sales environments like bike shops and ice-cream stores. The Johnsons, Larry and Meagan, represent a generation gap themselves in their work with jobsite issues. The Johnsons' point is that as the average lifespan continues to rise and retirement dates get delayed because of the tight economy, people of different generations are working side by side, more often bringing with them very different ideas about company loyalty and work values. The five generations are heavily influenced by quite different events, social trends, and the cultural phenomena of their times. Their experiences shape their behavior and make it difficult, sometimes, for managers to achieve a strong and efficient workplace. Larry and Meagan Johnson discuss all this in greater detail in a new book, ""Generations, Inc.: From Boomers to Linksters --- Managing the Friction Between Generations at Work,"" published by Amacom Press, which is available in all good bookstore from this Friday."

The author describes what happened at a fresher party to _ .	"It was a party. I was 18 and it was fresher week. I was at the beginning of a course in English Literature and full of enthusiasm for my subject. She was also 18 and enrolled in a course in physics. ""Your major is of no use to society. What will you do with it when you graduate, other than teach? Plus, you're going to be poor your whole life,"" she said. ""You have no soul and your degree is boring. I don't care how much money you're going to earn. I'd rather be poor and don't mind being a teacher. If I love my work I'll have something far more meaningful than a big bank account!"" came the reply. And so it went, back and forth, neither of us giving the other an inch, each of us stubbornly committed to our prejudice. We were both ignorant, but our ignorance was also society's ignorance. It had always been that way. Scientists mocked humanists; humanists laughed at scientists. Back in the 1960s, the physicist-turned novelist C. P. Snow labeled the sciences-humanities divide ""a problem of 'the two cultures'"" . He said it was bad for society. The modern world needed well-rounded people. I think I know better now, but it would have helped if we had been encouraged to think a little more outside our science and arts ""boxes"". That's why I believe it is healthy that China is beginning a debate on whether it's wise for young people to have to choose which direction their careers - and lives - will take at such an early age. At the moment, in their second year of high school, students must choose either the sciences or the humanities. After making the choice, they focus their energies on passing the appropriate college entrance exam. But now, people in China are asking: Is this forced, early decision good for young people or society? Young people need time to explore, to discover where their real talents and interests lie. There are more than just a few middle-aged people out there, stuck in jobs they hate because they made the wrong choice at the wrong time. And from the point of view of society, isn't it better for students to delay a while before they decide what to study? Scientists can benefit from learning to develop the critical skills associated with the humanities; students in the humanities, surely, only stand to gain by finding out a little more about science and technology, which are so important to the future of a developing country like China. With any luck, in the future young people fresh to college will be better informed about the possibilities of education than people of my generation."

Which of the following is NOT true according to the text?	"People Born in Autumn Live Longer People born in the autumn live longer than those born in the spring and are less likely to fall chronically ill when they are older, according to an Austrian scientist. Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. ""A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,"" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. ""When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone to infections of the digestive system."" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well."

Which one is the best title of this passage?	A life coach is somebody who helps you reach all kinds of personal and professional goals . Each of us has the ability to be our own life coach. Here are some tips for you: Pay attention to your relationships with others. Ask yourself the following questions: What do you do with disagreements? When was the last time you showed your family members that you care for them? Your relationships with friends, family members and teachers show a lot about the kind of person you are. Face the fears about the future. Now, imagine that one of your good friends told you that he or she was not strong enough to go back to school. We often give better advice than we are willing to take ourselves. Remember that even the most successful people were probably told that what they wanted to do was impossible, but they followed their dreams and succeeded. Develop your talents. If you want to reach your goals, you will have to spend more time developing the talents you already have, and uncovering any hidden talents that you haven't discovered yet. So you can take classes in subjects that you are interested in, even if you have no experience. Be thankful . Take some time to be thankful for the things you do have. Remember positive memories. Think of the best day(s) you have had in the past month or year. Remember special parties, vacations and holidays. Be thankful to the wonderful people you have in your life.

The best title for the passage is _ .	Millions of children in the United States go to summer camps. Some go to play outdoors at traditional camps in the woods, in the mountains or on lakes. But families now have many choices of special camps. These can be in the middle of nature or a big city. Special camps offer young people the chance to learn about different subjects: anything from space exploration to business to medicine. In technology camps, one subject that children can learn about is video game design. They learn how to use computer programs to create games of their own. One program that teaches video game design is called Cybercamps. Children can learn how to design their own virtual worlds to set their video game in. Then, they program their own rules and objects into the game. Cybercamps also offers courses in robot building and Web design. A recent story in the Washington Post described how one child made a robot that could sing a song. Another made a robot that could follow a black line drawn on a piece of cardboard. Also, children can learn how to make Web sites. One child made a site for Pokemon, one of his favourite cartoon shows.	['Special camps']
This passage is mainly talking about _ .	"Dog owners now have a little help understanding their furry friends . A new device called Bow-Lingual ""translates"" dog barks into English , Korea or Japanese. Bow-Lingual's Japanese inventors spent much time and money analyzing dog barks . They found that dog noises can be broken down into six different emotions : happiness , sadness , frustration , anger , assertion and desire . Part of the Bow-Lingual device hangs on the dog's collar . The other part is a handle-held unit for the owner . When the dogs barks , the unit displays translated phrases . Some people have scoffed at Bow-Lingual. ""Who would pay US$ 120 to read a dog's mind?"" they ask . But those who have purchased Bow-Lingual praise the device . Pet owner Keiko Egawa , of Japan , says it helps her empathize with her dog , Harry . ""Before we go to the park , he always says he wants to play,"" says Egawa , ""and after a walk , he always says he is hungry."" Bow -Lingual is not yet available in Chinese .

According to the passage, we know _ .	"In Kenya, educational and career opportunities are almost non-existent for people born with physical challenges. They face many forms of discrimination -- including beliefs that their condition was caused by a curse. But one father whose son Brain was born deaf, mute and blind aims to change all that. Joseph Shiroko started a school four years ago that teaches students who can not hear, speak and who have very low or no vision a wide range of skills to support themselves. The baby clothes the students knit are well known in the local community. And the school has developed a reputation for its dried smoked meat products. Brain Resource Center, a boarding school, teaches deaf and blind young Kenyans from across the country a variety of skills they can use to earn a living. ""We have a number of philosophies that inform what we are doing: accepting these people; loving them; giving them opportunities."" said founder Joseph Shiroko. Teachers, most of whom are graduates from the school or are themselves physically challenged, work with students. Mary Kerubo, 22, has a passion for knitting sweaters, which she plans to continue in her village. ""I feel comfortable here because Sween -- my teacher understands me,"" said Kerubo. ""Even if I do not see well, she always repeats her lessons again and again so that I may understand how to make sweaters. I know I will make it."" Kerubo's teacher, Sween Lyaka, was among the first graduates of Brain Resource Center four years ago. She says her students have a lot of unrecognized potential. Sween says in the future, she plans to purchase four sewing machines that she will use to teach students and produce and sell sweaters in her home village. The center also works with students' families to set up projects that will continue after the students graduate. Founder Joseph Shiroko's son, Brain, was the inspiration behind Brain Resource Center. The senior Shiroko says he began the school initially as a project to teach Brain bakery skills. The family later expanded Brain's training and brought in other young people with similar physical conditions."	"[""Joseph's son gave Joseph the inspiration to found Brian Resource Centre""]"

The writer mainly tells us _ .	Ye Xiaogang is known as one of the most famous modern Chinese composers. He learned to play the piano at the age of four.His father was a composer who wrote a lot of music for films.But when his father was sent to a farm to work.Ye was only 11 at that time. Ye had to work on another farm for a year before entering a factory.He worked in the factory for six years until he was 22. The workers in the factory were friendly and helped him a lot,but he could not play the piano any more.No matter how hard he worked on the farm or in the factory,he never left music.He just waited for chances.He dreamed of becoming a pianist. When Ye could play the piano again.he practiced hard every day in order to go to the Central Conservatory of Music in 1978.but the school would not recruit piano students that year.In the end.Ye chose composition as his major .although he was not familiar with it.

A similarity between college freshmen in the UK and China is that _ .	"Every September in China, people love to talk about the overprotective parents following their children around everywhere during university enrollment. Now, with more than 420,000 youngsters in the UK starting their new college school year, what is their first day like? BBC's Sean Coughlan described it in a recent report. According to Coughlan, at the very beginning it is not hard to spot something familiar to Chinese-a stream of parents arriving with their sons and daughters at the student village. Mothers, fathers and a teenager-now most likely taller than they are - stand together like the three might have done on the first day of primary school. ""The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows and nervous families,"" he writes. ""The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it."" But saying goodbye to parents is not the only similarity between college freshmen in the UK and China. In both cases, new arrivals most want to know about their Internet connections. ""It's their most urgent concern,"" notes Coughlan. Even on their first day, university in the UK won't be an entirely lonely experience for some new students. ""Before they arrive they have been using social networking to get to know their future roommates,"" writes Coughlan. Still, the first night is something no UK university student ever forgets. There are people they meet and then spend three years avoiding and people who become their friends for the rest of their lives. First week stories are all about over-partying, bad cooking and misguided clothing, Coughlan says. As he concludes: ""These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked for years to achieve."""

What's Justin Bieber's hobby?	"You love Jay Chou's songs and you can sing some quite well. So you make a video of your performance and post it online for your friends to see. But what if this led to something beyond your wildest imagination--a career in music? Canadian teenager Justin Bieber, 16, has just had the magical experience: He posted homemade videos of his versions of songs by American singer Chris Brown online for his relatives. He received a phone call from Brown, telling him how much he liked his performance. His singing eventually earned him a fan base and a record contract. After releasing a popular record in November 2009, his album My world 2.0 came out last Tuesday. Bieber sings ballads and songs about puppy love. But is he just another gooey teen idol? David Malitz, a columnist with the Washington Post, doesn't think so. ""If we truly want the best forAmerican children, let us pause and give thanks for Justin Bieber,"" he writes. ""After years of humdrum bubblegum from Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, the 16yearold has thrown a candycoated wrench into Disney's heartthrob assembly line by giving young fans something worth screaming their lungs out for lovable pop songs."" From a boy who grew up below the poverty line with his divorced mom to a star who caused nearriots in shopping malls, even Bieber himself can't believe his overnight fame, although his kind of success is becoming more and more common in the Internet era. Interested in hockey, the national sport of Canada, the boy once put up pictures of players on the walls of his bedroom. He dreamed of being a hockey star and used to practice signing his autograph. He doesn't need practice now. He signs autographs, if the girls can get close enough, as a music star."	['Hockey.']
Which of the following is true according to this article?	E-book is short for electronic( ) book. It is usually read on personal computers. Some mobile phones can also be used to read e-books. Earlier e-books were written for a specific group of readers and were about only a few subjects. With the development of the internet, knowledge and answers to a lot of questions mainly come from e-books. This is why the e-book business is increasing quickly E-books have many advantages. First, they save time. We don't need to go to a bookstore to buy books, besides, we can find the topic we want to know about on the Internet, and then we can quickly get many e-books on similar topics. Second, e-books save money. Some e-books cost a little money, and there are millions of e-books on the Internet that we can get for free. Third, more trees are saved because e-books don't need to be printed on paper. Fourth, e-books make reading more convenient. You can carry a whole library of hundreds of books with you in a small computer or any e-book reader without worrying about their weight. But e-books have certain disadvantages. They need a personal computer or an e-book reader and the information can be lost if its file format is not supported or changed in the reader's computer. However, e-books provide us with a new way of reading. That is good. ,.	['E-books can make reading more convenient.']
"The expression ""negative picture"" most probably means "" _ ""."	Who is there among us who hasn't dreamed of having his or her own small (maybe , several years later , even big )business , and having wonderful freedom , both from a boss and from the time clock ; the freedom to make up our own rules for our work , and our own plans --arranging our own hours of work ? That way work would be both painless and fun. Or, so we imagine. Well, in fact it isn't quite as simple as that. Yes , it is true that being the boss has its satisfactions and that you can arrange your working hours freely if you own your own small business . But in those early years of starting your own business, you shouldn't think of a free day, not to mention flying off for a month's vacation. It is not unusual for new business owners to work seventy or eighty hours a week , and if there is a day off , that day might need to be devoted to accounting . But this negative picture doesn't destroy the beautiful hopes. The possibility of getting something wonderful in return--both material and mental--continues to drive that large number of people who start up small businesses each year in the United States.

In what way did the policemen carry out the order from their officers?	"At one time no one could travel on an English road faster than four miles an hour. That was the law until 1896. A man had to walk in front of a car which could not go faster than the man. At night the man had to carry a red lamp. Once Charles Rolls brought a car from France to England, but he wanted to drive faster than four miles an hour. In order to have no trouble with the police, he had a talk with some of the police officers, who ordered their policemen to look the other way when the car came along the road. This was a good plan in the country, but not so easy to follow in the busy streets of London. One night Rolls and some friends started from London on their journey to Cambridge. One of the men walked in front with the red lamp, but he walked as fast as he could. The police became very interested in walls and shop-fronts when they heard the car and not one of them saw it. They reached a hill, but what a waste of time it was to drive down the hill at four miles an hour! Rolls was getting ready to jump into the car, but then he noticed a policeman who was not looking the other way. The slow car reached him. ""Good evening,"" said the policeman, looking at the car. ""Good evening,"" said Rolls, holding the lamp. ""One of these horseless things,"" said the policeman, looking at it with interest. ""Yes,"" said Rolls, and waited. ""I've often wanted a ride in one, but of course policemen can't buy things like that."" He turned and looked hopefully in Rolls's face. ""Jump in,"" said Rolls. ""Thanks,"" said the policeman, and did so. ""Now,"" he said, sitting down, ""You can let it go just as you like down this hill. There isn't another policeman on this road for a mile and a half."""

What can we know about Mr Blickez?	"It was an extremely hot day. My younger brother Walt and I had decided to go swimming in the stream behind Mr Blickez's house, because it would be the only way to cool ourselves down. Across his farm and through some woods was a deep swimming hole supplied by several cold springs . The only problem with our plan was that this farm was guarded by a huge mean Hereford bull . Mr Blickez had told us that Elsie, the animal's name, was the meanest bull in town, maybe even the county, and we believed in him. But the hotter it got, the more we thought there was reason to doubt about what he said. For one thing, we remembered Mr Blickez liked telling tall tales; for another, Elsie seemed like a strange name for a bull. Finally, I talked Mom into asking permission for us to walk through the farm, and Mr Blickez finally agreed. On our way across the farm, we stopped at the fence to admire the swimming hole. The sun shone brightly across the cool waters. We couldn't wait to get there. Suddenly, Walt shouted loudly. Elsie had run to him and was licking his back. I immediately hid under the fence. However, when I looked up, I saw that Elsie wasn't a big mean bull at all. She was just a friendly young cow, and she was going to keep licking my brother's back as long as he stood still. When we discovered the truth, we were so happy. We then ran to the swimming hole and jumped in. The water was just as wonderful as we had dreamed. After that day, we had many good days and we often visited our secret swimming hole guarded by the so-called ""big mean bull""."	['He often tells lies.']
What did the man think might have happened?	"A man came home from work and found his three children outside, still in their pajamas playing in the mud,with empty food boxes and wrappers thrown all around the front yard. The door of his wife's car was open,as was the front door to the house and there was no sign of the dog. Walking into the entry,he found an even bigger mess. A lamp had been knocked over. In the front room the TV was loudly blaring a cartoon channel,and the family room was thrown with toys and various items of clothing. In the kitchen,dishes filled the sink,breakfast food was spilled on the counter,the fridge door was open wide, dog food was spilled on the floor,a broken glass lay under the table,and a small pile of sand was spread by the back door. He quickly headed up the stairs,stepping over toys and more piles of clothes,looking for his wife. He was worried she might be ill,or that something serious had happened. He was met with a small drop of water as it made its way out the bathroom door. As he looked inside he found wet towels, soap and more toys thrown over the floor. Miles of toilet paper lay in a heap and toothpaste had been put over the mirror and walls. As he rushed to the bedroom, he found his wife still sleeping in the bed in her pajamas,reading a novel. She looked up at him,smiled,and asked how his day went. He looked at her puzzled and asked, ""What happened here today?"" She again smiled and answered,""You know every day when you come home from work and ask me what in the world I did today?"" ""Yes,"" was his reply. She answered,""Well,today I didn't do it."""

What might the lady think of her boyfriend after having a meal together at this restaurant?	The food in White Rose Restaurant was cheap and good, but nobody seemed to want to eat there. There were very few people going to eat there. The owner was very worried about it. Then he thought of a good idea. A few weeks later, his restaurant was always full of men and their girlfriends. Whenever a gentleman came with a lady, a kind waiter would give each of them a beautiful menu. The menus looked exactly the same on the outside, but there was an important difference inside. The menu that the waiter handed to the man gave the correct price for each dish and each bottle of wine, while the menu that he handed to the lady gave a much higher price! So when the man calmly ordered dish after dish and wine after wine, the lady thought he was much more generous than he really was! The man could make a good impression on the lady.

The passage is mainly about _ .	On Jan. 13th, 2009, the Peanut Corporation of prefix = st1 /Americaissued a recall for products it had made over the past six months, after five people had died and more than 400 had fallen ill with salmonella poisoning as a result of contamination. Two weeks later, the recall was extended to more than 400 consumer products made since Jan. 1, 2007, including Jenny Craig nutritional bars and Keebler Peanut Butter Sandwich Crackers, while the toll from the contamination had reached eight dead and more than 500 sickened in 43 states, half of them children. The company's factory in Blakely,Ga., which was the source of the contamination, supplied some of the largest food makers in the nation. The outbreak showed the complexities of the industrial food chain, and left consumers to figure out if some food in their cabinets had a danger. The recall of peanut products is the latest in a series of increasingly severe food contamination scares involving tomatoes, spinach, cantaloupes and other foods. TheGeorgiaplant, which is closed, packed peanut butter in bulk ranging from 5 to 1,700 pounds, much of which was shipped to institutions. Many school districts have pulled peanut butter from menus, with some substituting more commonly recognized supermarket brands. New York City school officials said they had not bought any peanut butter or products with ingredients that originated at theGeorgiaplant. An F.D.A. inspection team that visited the plant on Jan. 9 discovered that on 12 occasions in 2007 and 2008 tests conducted by the company found salmonella contamination in its products but that it shipped the contaminated products to customers after a retest found no contamination and did nothing to clean the plant.

_ was in the middle of the lake.	"Some years ago on a hot summer day in south Florida, a little boy decided to go for a swim in the lake behind his house. He ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator was getting close. The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them. Luckily, after weeks and weeks in the hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were seriously scarred by the terrible attack of the animal. And on his arms, were deep scars where his mother's fingernails dug into his arms in her effort to pull the son she loved. The newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted the legs. And then, he said to the reporter, ""Look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mum wouldn't let go."""	['An alligator']
What can be inferred from the text?	Believe it or not, going to school is not a legal requirement in the United States. It is a legal requirement that all kids be educated, though. When parents believe they can give their kids a better education--- or have other reasons for not wanting to send their kids to a local school --- they may choose home schooling. However, if a kid hates school, home schooling is probably not the escape he is looking for. Home schooled students can learn just as much as they would in regular school if they and their parents work hard to cover all the subjects and experiences necessary. Parents who home school usually have higher levels of education than parents who do not. They already have the skills to educate themselves about teaching their kids. Parents who home school have to be able to put the time and skill into not just teaching, but also researching lesson plans and resources . So they have to know how to find the information necessary to teach their kids. State schools often provide home-schooling parents with a curriculum , books and materials and places to meet. Some state schools will point parents to other resources for _ forgotten subjects. Or parents may receive continuing education at local colleges or universities.

The summer vacation is about _ .	The final exam comes with June. When the exam ends , the summer vacation begins. Boys and girls have about two months to relax. The summer vacation is the best part of the year for most children. The weather is usually fine. They can swim, go to summer camp or visit other places with their parents. Of course, the beaches are good places for relaxing. Some children are lucky to live near the sea. They can enjoy the sea anytime . But for the children far from the sea, they go to the beaches for one or two weeks with their parents. Why do children like spending their summer vacations on the beaches? It is because they like the sand , the sun, the cool wind and the sea water. There are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat, and exciting things to do. ,.	['two months']
The purpose in writing this text is _ .	Excused from recycling because you live in a high rise with a rubbish chute ? You won't be for long. Miami's Mark Shantzis has made it simple for those living in tall buildings to use the chute and recycle too . In Shantzis' Hi-Rise Recycling System, a chute leads to a pie-shaped container with six boxes that can turn around when operated. The system , which fits in the same space as the chute and container now in use, enables glass , plastic , paper , metal , and other rubbish to go into separate boxes . The system is controlled from a board next to the chute door. The board has a button for each class of recycling materials (as well as for unrecyclables). At the press of a button, a microcomputer locks all other floors' chute door and sets the recycling container turning until the right box comes under the chute. The computer also counts the loads and gives a signal by phone when the box is full. And a particular piece of equipment breaks up the nonrecyclables Sorting recyclables before they are collected saves the use of expensive materials recovery equipment which otherwise has to do the sorting . Such equipment often makes recycled materials very expensive, so expensive that tons of recyclables remain wasted . Shantzis believes his system could help recycled materials become more cost-effective.	['to introduce a recycling system for high rises']
Which statement is NOT true according to the passage?	"However urban life strikes you, cities worldwide have been growing ever more rapidly. Some of this growth has occurred in the developed world, but the most dramatic increase has been in the Third World. Almost all the world's population growth over the next 30 years will take place in the cities of developing countries By the year 2030, for the first time in history, 60 percent of the world's people will be living in cities. This is actually good news in some ways. ""Cities are the fundamental building blocks of prosperity,"" says Marc Weiss, chairman of the Prague Institute for Global Urban Development, "" both for the nation and for families."" Industrial and commercial activities in urban areas account for between 50 and 80 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries of the world"" there's the crazy notion that the way to deal with a city's problems is to keep people out of them,""Weiss continued. ""But the problems of the rural life are even more serious than those of the city."" For better or worse, urban-watchers are clear on one point: The quality of life for most people in the future will be determined by the quality of cities. Those cities will be bigger than ever. And yet, population numbers by themselves don't determine a city's prospects; after all, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Hamburg, Germany, have the same population. Nor is explosive growth necessarily the determining factor. ""City problems,"" one authority points out, ""mostly have to do with weak, ineffective, and usually unrepresentative city governments."""

Which of the following may be a suitable title for the story?	"When a dog bites a man, it usually doesn't make news. However, this saying change when Beijing and several other Chinese cities announced the ""Civilized Dog Raising"" campaign in November. The government will require Beijingers to get licenses for their dogs, and will enforce the one-dog, one-family policy. Police say the ""one-dog policy"" is aimed at reducing the number of dog bites and lowering the risk of rabies. According to the Ministry of Health, rabies has become the top infectious disease in China. Dangerous dogs and dogs taller than 35 centimeters, such as Great Danes, have been banned from urban areas. Pet owners are also required to clean up their dog's droppings and make sure dogs are leashed , especially in public areas. Some public areas, such as banks, are closed to dogs entirely. Dogs are regarded as man's best friend and the history of raising dogs can be traced back to the stone age. It therefore seems sad that dogs are unwelcome in Beijing. But it is not the case that Beijingers dislike dogs. Actually, there are many dog lovers in Beijing. The city now has more than 550,000 registered dogs, up 20 percent from the previous year. The problem is, actually, about living space. Different from many Westerners, most Beijingers live in urban apartment buildings, not houses in the suburbs. There is very limited open space for walking dogs. The barking, the waste, and unleashed dogs in buildings, elevators and places people gather can cause fear, fights and frustration. Beijing is not the only city to have a dog problem. Paris, London, New York and Vienna all face similar challenges and have common rules for dogs and their owners."	['Civilized Dog Raising']
What is the author's purpose of writing this passage?	"Who is the most powerful woman in the world? According to the US media, it's Janet Yellen, or at least she's about to be. On Oct 9, 2013,US President Barack Obama nominated Yellen to serve as the next US Federal Reserve (the Fed, )chair. If confirmed by the Senate, Yellen will become the first woman to serve in the top spot. Aged 67, silver-haired and tiny, Yellen is said to be the most qualified nominee ever. She chaired President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, taught at Harvard and Berkeley, and was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She is currently the Fed's vice chair. Many think Yellen is the right choice to deal with the challenges the Fed now faces:First, to bring interest rates back to more normal levels without triggering a new recession .Second, to reduce the US unemployment rate, which remains at historically high levels. A CNN opinion piece says Yellen is unusual for an economist of her caliber .""She has kept her eyes on what's critical-the people. Her research has centered on unemployment, on the best way to modulate government policies to benefit the people."" Past records also show that Yellen is exceptionally good at predicting where the economy is headed. An article in The Washington Post points out that she was one of the few voices at the Fed inDecember 2009 warning about the subprime crisis and the following recession. The reason why Yellen will be the most powerful woman in the world has to do with the unique position of the Federal Reserve, explains an article on Quartz, a US news outlet for business people in the new global economy, First of all, the Fed is independent. Unlike US Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Hilary Clinton, the decisions made by the organization Yellen will lead next year are not subject to approval by anyone in the government. Within the Fed, the chair alone sets the agenda. The Fed chairperson has huge influence on monetary policy and financial regulation. And don't forget how powerful the Fed itself is. It controls the money supply in the world's largest economy. The Fed's interest rate decisions don't just set the course for the US economy, its decisions set the course for the world economy, too. Because of globalization, Yellen's decisions will affect everyone around the world, says an article in The Atlantic, making her even more powerful than some great women rulers in history, including Elizabeth I of England and China's Wu Zetian. For example, the article continues: ""If Yellen even just talks about slowing down the Fed's bond-buying, Europe's troubled economies are likely to see their interest rates rise, and emerging markets, some of which, like India and Indonesia, used foreign capital to fund their current account deficits ,are likely to see their currencies collapse."""

What does this passage mainly talk about?	"There are many traditions around the holidays.

But there is a ""new"" Christmas tradition that has become very popular: _ , a TV channel that shows nothing but a large log fire, blazing in a fireplace. People put it on their TV and it makes them feel like they are watching and listening to a crackling fire. It makes them feel calm and comfortable. The origin dates back to 1986 in Canada. At that time, not very many people knew about it or watched the channel. Today, more than three million people watch the firelog channel during the winter holiday season. That year, the firelog channel was created to give the workers in the company that is now called Shaw Cable, a break at Christmas. By running the firelog during the holidays, everyone could go home for a few days and enjoy a bit of time off. At that time, it was only broadcast to people in Edmonton but today it reaches people across Canada and beyond. This year, the Shaw firelog was updated. It is pretty high tech. Although it's still really just a fire log that has been filmed, it has its own Twitter account (@ShawFireLog), its own Facebook page and it even has a computer App so you can see the burning log on a smartphone or a tablet. The Shaw firelog will burn until Jan. 5 on Shaw Cable, channel 222."	['The origin and popularity of the TV firelog.']

Every family will have at least one _ in the future.	Life in the future will be different from life today. The population is growing fast. There will be more people in the world and most of them will live longer. Computer will be much smaller and more useful, and there will be at least one in each home. And computer science will be one of the most important subjects in school then. People will work fewer hours than they do now, and they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and travel. Our food will be different, too. More land will be used for building new towns and houses for people. So there will be less land for cows and sheep, and meat will be more expensive. Maybe no one will eat it one day. They will eat more fruits and vegetables. Work in the future will also be different. Robots will do dangerous and hard work. Because of this, many people will have no jobs to do. This will be a big problem in the future. ,.	['computer']
Why do the children spend all of their time with these media? Because _ .	"Zach Linsky, 11, watches TV for 3 and a half hours a day and plays video games every other day. Zach, a sixth grader in Washington, D. C., is an American. But unlike many kids, he doesn't have a TV, VCR, or computer in his bedroom. He only has a boom box . The survey of 3,155 kids, aged 2 to 18, shows that they spend 5 hours and 29 minutes on average a day using some types of media outside of school, including 2 hours and 46 minutes watching TV, 21 minutes on the computer, 20 minutes playing video games, and 8 minutes on the Internet. The good news: The total includes 44 minutes spent reading. The survey also shows that those aged 2 to 7 spend 3 hours and 9 minutes watching TV every day and shows that 32 percent in that age group have TV sets in their rooms. Among those aged 8 to 18, 21 percent have computers in their rooms, 65 percent have TV sets, and 61 percent say their parents don't stop them from watching TV. Nearly 1 in 4 say they watch more than 5 hours a day. ""Kids are living much more lonely lives than ever before,"" says Kay S. Hytnowitz. ""They just disappear into their rooms and spend all of their time with these media."""	['they feel very lonely']
If work-ins can recondition your mind and improve your attitude, then work-outs probably can _	"Fitness isn't just physical: Change your thoughts, and you change your world. Of course we can all agree that gaining and losing weight, exercise, diet, strength, and flexibility are all a part of fitness. But what about body image, self-esteem, aging, relationships, success and happiness? They are all related, all connected, and fitness in all areas is important if you want true and total fitness. But you may say, ""I just want to lose 20 pounds. If I do, I will feel better about myself and I will be happy."" Maybe in the short term, but honestly, if we don't deal with our mental and emotional fitness while working on the physical fitness, there is very little chance of keeping the weight off, feeling good about yourself, and improving every other area of your life. Let's not waste time in changing our bodies when they will only change back if we don't change our minds, too. Let's work ""out"" and work ""in"" at the same time. Change your mind-and you must, because if you have been trying to lose weight, but cannot, there is something inside of you that is disallowing it. You can change this pattern, improve your self-esteem, increase your joy, and change your body for good by focusing on changing your mind, too. This is training of life. Work-ins will recondition your mind, improve your attitude, change your perception and stimulate motivation at the same time you are conditioning your body for weight loss, shaping, strength and endurance. If you repeat a positive statement over and over to yourself-like a mantra, your mind will change, the same way your body does, even if you don't believe it. Like lifting a weight over and over, your muscle changes-even if you don't believe it. Try it-what have you got to lose? Say, ""I am ready for my body to be healthier, leaner, and stronger. I love it already."" Say it over and over while you are walking or running or doing any exercise. Pick a statement that works for you-something positive and in the present tense."

From the story we know the _ .	"A student was going to spend his holiday in a cool mountain village. That evening he stayed at an inn near the railway station . Before going to bed, he went to the boss of the inn and said, ""Excuse me, sir. Will you please wake me up at a quarter to five tomorrow morning? I'll take the five o'clock train."" ""Oh, sorry, sir,"" the boss said in a hurry, ""I'm afraid I can't. I won't be able to get up so early."" The student was disappointed . When he began to return to his room, be stopped and asked, ""Have you got an alarm-clock ? Maybe it can help me."" ""Wait a minute, then."" The boss said and brought out an alarm-clock. ""Here you are, sir."" ""Thank you very much."" The student said happily. But he found it was rusty when he had a look at it. And it sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. He asked, ""Will it ring in time?"" ""I don't know, either."" said the boss, ""But it doesn't matter. You just give it a good shake at a quarter to five. And it will ring on time."""

Why is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn considered Twain's greatest works?	"THIS year the US Mint will honor one of the country's most famous writers. ""Mark Twain"", the pen name of Samuel Clemens(1835-1911) is loved by American readers for his novels Tom Sawyer(1876) and The Adventures of Huckberry Finn(1844). Now he is going to have his life and work commemorated with special gold and silver coins. But does Twain need to be commemorated? It doesn't seem like people in the US will forget him. Twain once joked that a lack of money is the root of all evil "" but a lack of money with Twain's famous face on it wouldn't have made people forget about him. The Adventures of Huckberry Finn is thought to be his greatest works. Motherless Huck Finn is a young boy who shows the spirit of freedom. But it could be said that Huck's freedom really comes from Huck wanting to fly. When Huck gets away from his violent father, he isn't really looking for freedom,out survival. It's even more of a problem for a slave. Jim, the escaped slave who Huck helps, makes Huck's life seem even better. It's easier not to be able to deal with someone who wants to force you to go to school than to have to fight a law that says you are a piece of property . Huck and Jim's friendship, as shown by Mark Twain, is one of the great stories in American literature because it shows a white character, Huck, who gets an idea of the African American experience. Mark Twain is famous and would still be famous without any special coins. Anyway, the coins could be a reason to look again at the work of a writer who got under the skin of the US in the 19th century. With the race issue _ in the US today, perhaps Twain still has something to teach today's readers."	['It talks about a white American understanding the African American experience.']
When the writer biked the wrong way down a one way street, she felt _ .	"A few days ago we - that's me and the husband - took a cab to the station. Chat with the driver fell to the wrong of cyclists, and the misunderstanding of the road rules. So far as the rules of the road go, there seems to be one basic principle: when you are driving a car you hate bikes, when you are riding a bike you hate cars (and I guess walkers hate everyone). There is an obvious difference of viewpoint built in here. It wasn't until I started to drive a car (almost 20years after I had first rode a bike) that I actually realized that you could not see a cyclist at night without lights. In fact I now want to shout at late night cyclists without lights(like motortists once did at me): ""You'll get killed, sunshine, I can't see you."" The problem is that cyclists do ride headlong into danger. It's not just not having lights. It's biking on pavements (and so threatening to injure a load of innocent walkers in the process) and biking down one-way streets the wrong way. I admit that I do bike the wrong way down a one-way street sometimes. My feeble defense is that I try always to do it as if I know I was doing wrong. That is slowly, with an apologetic look on the face, and ready to get off at any minute. I can't bear the guys (usually, but not always it is guys) who do it as if they owned the place, and at high speed. So cyclists are not entirely innocent. But they are among the disadvantaged groups, because the bottom line is that a car or a lorry can kill a cyclist and not the other way around."	['guilty']
Which of the following is true?	Television is good. You'd like to watch it all day and all night. But too much TV is a very bad thing. Scientists found that kids who watch too much TV may have more trouble learning to read. They can't focus on their work. Kids learn language skills best by reading, talking and playing with others. If they spend too much time watching TV, they'll have less time for those things. Watching too much TV is bad for people's health. People don't move much while watching TV. What's more, they may eat a lot of food while watching. This can make them fat. We call these people couch potatoes. Fighting on TV is a big problem for kids. Yong people are good at following. Scientists have found that those who watch a lot of fighting shows are more likely to fight.	"[""It'seasyforkidswhowatchalotoffightingshowstofight withothers.""]"
What's the author's attitude towards the future of breath detectors?	"People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath. In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases. ""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing."" He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness. But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can. ""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."""	['Positive']
At last the waiter came back with an umbrella, because _ .	A young man called Jack has visited many countries. He knows few foreign languages, but he can always find someone who knows enough English to understand what he says. Last summer he went to China. He enjoyed himself in China and liked Chinese food very much. One day he went into a restaurant in a small village. He knew the Chinese word 'rice', so he ordered some rice. The village was famous for its mushrooms, and Jack thought they must be very fresh and delicious. He asked the waiter in English. However, the waiter couldn't understand at all, so he could do nothing for Jack. Jack thought hard. When he saw a piece of paper on the table, he had a good idea. He took out a pencil and drew a picture of a mushroom carefully. The waiter looked at the picture for a long time, then he smiled and left. A few minutes later, he came back with a black umbrella in his hand.	['the mushroom Jack drew looked like an umbrella']
One way for an animal to become transparent is to _ .	"Life in the Clear Transparent animals let light pass through their bodies the same way light passes through a window. These animals typically live between the surface of the ocean and a depth of about 3,300 feet--as far as most light can reach. Most of them are extremely delicate and can be damaged by a simple touch. Sonke Johnsen, a scientist in biology, says, ""These animals live through their life alone. They never touch anything unless they're eating it, or unless something is eating them."" And they are as clear as glass. How does an animal become see-through? It's trickier than you might think. The objects around you are visible because they interact with light. Light typically travels in a straight line. But some materials slow and scatter light, bouncing it away from its original path. Others absorb light, stopping it _ in its tracks. Both scattering and absorption make an object look different from other objects around it, so you can see it easily. But a transparent object doesn't absorb or scatter light, at least not very much, Light can pass through it without bending or stopping. That means a transparent object doesn't look very different from the surrounding air or water. You don't see it ----you see the things behind it. To become transparent, an animal needs to keep its body from absorbing or scattering light. Living materials can stop light because they contain pigments that absorb specific colors of light. But a transparent animal doesn't have pigments, so its tissues won't absorb light. According to Johnsen, avoiding absorption is actually easy. The real challenge is preventing light from scattering. Animals are built of many different materials----skin, fat, and more----and light moves through each at a different speed. Every time light moves into a material with a new speed, it bends and scatters. Transparent animals use different tricks to fight scattering. Some animals are simply very small or extremely flat. Without much tissue to scatter light, it is easier to be see--through. Others build a large, clear mass of non-living jelly-lie material and spread themselves over it . Larger transparent animals have the biggest challenge, because they have to make all the different tissues in their bodies slow down light exactly as much as water does. They need to look uniform. But how they're doing it is still unknown. One thing is clear for these larger animals, staying transparent is an active process. When they die, they turn a non-transparent milky white."

We can infer from the passage that _ .	"In Stockholm, the Swedish Academy has chosen the British author Doris Lessing for the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature. The selection of Doris Lessing for a Nobel was popular among the hundreds of journalists gathered for the announcement in Stockholm. Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy Horace Engdahl said with skepticism, fire and visionary power Lessing has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny. Doris Lessing was born in 1919 in Persia - modern-day Iran - to British parents, moving as a child with her family to southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she stayed in school only to the age of 14. A year after moving to London, she published her first novel in 1950.The Grass is Singingexamines unbridgeable racial conflict in colonial Africa through the eyes of a white farmer's wife and her black servant. A member of the British Communist Party during the 1950s and a campaigner against nuclear arms and South African apartheid, Lessing was for years banned from that country and from Rhodesia. Her literary breakthrough came in 1962 with publication ofThe Golden Notebook, seen by many, though not necessarily Lessing, as a pioneering work of modern feminism. A disjointed study of the mind of the main character, Anna Wulf, the novel explores her thoughts about Africa, politics and communism, relationships with men and sex, and Jungian analysis and dream interpretation. Lessing's themes shifted to psychology in her works from the 1960s, and by the 1970s she was fascinated with the Islamic mystic tradition of Sufism. Her turn toward science fiction withthe Canopusseries in the early 1980s was not warmly received by traditionalist critics, but she has continued to win new readers and numerous literary awards, including the David Cohen British Literary Prize and the Companion of Honour from the Royal Society of Literature, both in 2001. Following the announcement, the Horace Engdahl told VOA why he was personally so pleased with Lessing's selection. ""She is one of the truly great writers - of novels, short stories, fiction and non-fiction,"" Engdahl said. ""She is one of the few writers who have had the courage to uphold the principle of equality between the male and female experience, and she has given the impulse to numbers of other women writers. And she is really the mother of a _ that is one of the most important in our contemporary literature."" At 87, Doris lessing is the oldest Nobel Literature laureate since the first prizes were awarded in 1901. Each Nobel Prize is this year accompanied by a check for approximately $1.4 million."

The best title for the passage might be _ .	"Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to ensure time in front of the television have been invented in the prefix = st1 /UK. The shoes--dubbed Square Eyes - contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves, based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to combat the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, said Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London. "" We looked at current issues and childhood obesity really stood out,"" she told New Scientist. ""And I wanted to tackle that with my design. Once a child has used up their daily _ gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals precisely one minute of TV time."	['Smart shoes deciding on television time.']
Further education is _ .	"Further education is officially described as the""post-secondary stage of education, comprising all vocational and non-vocational provision made for young people who have left school, or for adults"". Further education thus embraces the vast range of university, technical, commercial, and art education and the wide field of adult education. It is this sector of education, which is concerned with education beyond the normal school-leaving ages of 16 or 18, that has experienced the most astonishing growth in the number of students. In the 19th century the dominance of Oxford and Cambridge was challenged by the rise of the civic universities, such as London, Manchester, and Birmingham. Following the lead of the 18th century German universities and responding to a public demand for increased opportunity for higher education, Britain's new civic universities quickly acquired recognition--not only in technological fields but also in the fine and liberal arts. Many new post-school technical colleges were founded in the early 20th century. The Fisher Act of 1918 empowered the local authorities to levy a rate (tax) to finance such colleges. The universities, on the other hand, received funds from the central government through the University Grants Committee, established in 1911 and recognized in 1920, after World War I. A new type of technical college was established in the 1960s--the polytechnic, which provides mainly technological courses of university level as well as courses of a general kind in the arts and sciences. Polytechnics are chartered to award degrees validated by a Council for National Academic Awards. Thus, the third level in the United Kingdom is made up of colleges of further education, technical colleges, polytechnics, and universities. The colleges offer full-time and part-time courses beyond compulsory-school level. Polytechnics and universities are mainly responsible for degrees and research. The innovative Open University, with its flexible admission policy and study arrangements, opened in 1971. It uses various media to provide highly accessible and flexible higher education for working adults and other part-time students. It serves as an organizational model and provides course-materials for similar institutions in other countries. Changes in British education in the second half of the 20th century have, without changing the basic values in the system, extended education by population, level, and content. New areas for expansion include immigrant cultural groups and multicultural content, the accommodation of special needs, and the development of tools and content in the expanding fields of microelectronics."

In the opinion of Susie's mom, friends _ .	"""Hey, do you know what? Today is May Day!"" my sister announced. ""Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?"" I recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them. I clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade. Her interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house. When my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, ""Absolutely not!"" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. ""But Pam was my very best friend ever,"" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket. It was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, ""Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!""."	['leave each other enough room to grow']
The World Values Survey suggests people are more likely to promote happiness if.	"""Happiness isn't just feeling good.It's good for you and for society.Happy people are more successful, have better relationships, are healthier and live longer,""said Ed Diener, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. Beyond your genes Sonja, a professor of psychology at University of California Riverside, analyzed studies on identical twins and concluded that happiness is 50 percent genetic, 40 percent intentional and 10 percent circumstantial. ""Your circumstances-where you live, your health, your work, your marriage-can be tough to change .But most people are surprised that circumstances don't account for as much of their happiness as they think,""she said. Life circumstances don't result in continuous happiness, she says, because we adapt.That new car, promotion or house feels great at first.Then we get used to it. Keeping that good feeling requires something else: control of how you act and think. Happiness definition To gain happiness, you need to understand what happiness is. Martin Seligman, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says happiness is the pursuit of engaging and meaningful activities. By ""engaging"", he means when we get so absorbed in what we are doing that we lose track of time.""Meaningful"" would be using what you are best at to serve others or to participate in a cause that's bigger than yourself. ""Your purpose doesn't have to be giant,"" says psychologist Dan Baker. ""If you'reyou're your purpose can be getting into the college of your choice.When you're a parent, it can be getting your kids off to school safely and prepared for each day. External factors From 1981 to 2007, the World Values Survey took polls(lJ)all over the world and measured what it considers happiness and overall life satisfaction.Of the 52 countries that completed the surveys over the 17-year period, happiness increases in 45. According to the survey analysis, economic growth helped promote happiness for some, while Democratization and rising social tolerance contributed even more. Democracy provides more choice, which promotes happiness.Support for sex equality and tolerance of people who are different from oneself are also strongly linked.This is not just because tolerant people are happier, but because living in a tolerant society strengthens everyone's freedom."

Plan UK, an international children's charity, has made its gift list focusing on helping the world's poorest countries to improve their education conditions. ""Every year we rack our brains for the perfect present and too often end up with yet another pair of socks or a useless ornament,"" said Marie Staunton, Plan UK's chief executive. ""This year we are offering people in the UK the chance to give twice. Buying an alternative gift for a loved one could likely save the life of some of the world's poorest children.""

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"Three astronauts returned to Earth safely on Wednesday after a successful 15-day mission , marking another step forward towards the country's goal of building a manned space station by 2020. Zhang Youxia, commander-in-chief of China's manned space program, said the Shenzhou X mission was a ""complete success"". The Shenzhou X landed safely in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region at about 8:07 a.m. on June 26, 2013. All three astronauts were in good physical condition. Nie Haisheng, commander of the Shenzhou X crew and a second-time space traveler, was the first to get out of the bowl-like module , followed by Wang Yaping, the only female astronaut of the mission, and Zhang Xiaoguang. During a brief welcoming ceremony held at the landing area, the astronauts waved happily to a crowd consisting of officers, the search and recovery team, and health personnel. ""It feels really good to be back home,"" said astronaut Nie Haisheng. ""We are dreamers, and we have now realized our dream,"" said Zhang Xiaoguang. ""Our space dream knows no limit, and our hard work will never stop,"" he said. Compared with its previous mission Shenzhou IX last year, the Shenzhou X is no longer experimental but considered an applicable shuttle system for sending astronauts and supplies to orbiting modules. The mission aims to further test technologies designed for docking and supporting astronauts' stay in space, as well as to use new technologies related to the construction of a space station. In its 15-day journey in space, Shenzhou X docked with the orbiting space lab Tiangong-1 twice, once through automatic operation and the other manual .The Tiangong-1 space lab has been in orbit for more than 600 days. It's designed to work for two years. The module is considered the first step in building a permanent space station in the future. And the astronauts spent 12 days in Tiangong-1, where they conducted space medical experiments, technical tests and gave a science lesson to students on Earth on June 19 about basic physics principles. The lecture was the second video class sent from space, with US astronaut Barbara Morgan's 25-minute class being the first in 2007. China is the third country after the United States and Russia to acquire the technologies and skills necessary for space rendezvous and docking procedures, as well as supply manpower and material for an orbiting module via different docking methods. Previous docking procedures conducted between Shenzhou-type spacecraft and the orbiting space lab included two automated dockings by the unmanned Shenzhou-8 in 2011 and both an automated and manual docking by the manned Shenzhou-9 in 2012. Since its first manned space space mission in 2003, China has sent ten astronauts and six spacecrafts into the space."	['China is the second country to give a space class']
We can learn that the book Life of Pi _ .	"First published in 2001, the book Life of Pi written by Canadian author Yann Martel won the Man Booker Prize and an Asian American Prize for Literature. It is the story of a young boy named Pi who spends 227 days at sea with a small group of animals after disaster strikes their ship and is an account of his journey of survival and hardship. Piscine ""Pi"" Molitor Patel, on whom Life of Pi is based, is a young boy living in Pondicherry, India, where his father owns a zoo. The story starts when Patel's family decide to move to Canada, along with their zoo animals for their new home. However, because of the bad weather, the ship sinks. Pi along with an orangutan , an injured zebra, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker are the only survivors who take shelter in a small lifeboat. Both the injured zebra and the orangutan are soon killed and eaten by the hyena. The tiger in turn kills and eats the hyena, leaving just the two of them alone on the boat now. In an effort to avoid being eaten by Richard Parker, Pi acts himself as the head of the group and remains safe from harm. Since he does not want the tiger to die for fear of going mad by being alone on the boat, he fishes and feeds the two of them in order to stay alive. The life of Pi then enters its third stage when their lifeboat washes up on the shores of Mexico and the tiger escapes into a nearby forest leaving Pi alone. After the Mexicans refuse to believe Pi's story, he changes his tale by replacing the animals with his mother, a cook and a sailor and asks the Mexicans which one they prefer. They prefer hearing the first story though they do not believe a word of it. In my view, Life of Pi is a must read book for all those who love reading."	['was awarded two prizes']
We can't wave to say goodbye in _ .	Our new foreign students are going to arrive very soon, and here are some ways to communicate with them politely. How close do you stand when you talk to a friend? You can stand close to people in the Middle East but don't stand too close to North Americans! Give them more personal space. Do you know How to _ people correctly? Chinese girls often walk arm in arm with their friends. South Americans sometimes hold your arm when they talk to you, so you can't move away! But in Britain many people don't like other people to touch them at all. Do you look at people when you talk? In some places, it isn't polite to look at people when you talk, but in other countries it isn't polite to look somewhere else. In Britain and the US, people usually look at each other when they talk. And how do you say goodbye? That's easy, wave to say goodbye. But be careful! In Greece, it's not at all polite! In fact, it's very rude!	['Greece']
How did Buster decide which objects to take?	"Buster Brown was a thief and a good one too, he thought. He'd never been caught by the police because he never took chances. He was always prepared for any unforeseen event or emergency. Confidently, he stood outside the house of his intended victim and read the sign on the front gate of the house. ""Don't worry about the dog--be aware of the owner!"" it said. Buster smiled and found his way in. The house looked quite normal outside, but inside it was very _ with fascinating objects on show. As he began putting them into his bag, a dog came into the room. It stopped when it saw Buster, then wagged its tail madly and went over to him, licking his outstretched hand. ""Good boy, ""Buster whispered. ""What a great guard dog you are--trying to lick me to death."" Satisfied he'd made friends with the dog, Bluster began to wander round the house, choosing items to put in his bag. His skilled eye picked out only the best antiques :a pair of silver candle holders, a silver tea-and-coffee service, etc. . His new friend, the dog, sat and watched, as if wondering what was happening. ""Well, boy,"" Buster whispered, finally. ""That might do. Any more and I won't be able to carry it! "" He swung the heavy bag onto his shoulders, just as the lights came on, nearly blinding him. He shielded his eyes with his hand. ""You're a very silly person,"" the figure in the doorway said, his voice dry and dust. As the man came closer, Buster could see he was well dressed. His face seemed familiar, but Buster couldn't quite place where he had seen him before. ""You should have taken more notice of the sign outside,"" the man rasped. ""I knew about this attempted robbery last week and I also know you will end up behind bars for 20 years. Fancy trying to rob the house of the world's greatest fortune -teller!"""

The government is encouraging people to _ .	"Families should not waste their money on organic food,the government has warned.They should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford,even if it means eating frozen vegetables.The government now faces calls to endPS20 million of subsidies to organic farming. A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 percent more antioxidants than non-organic crops.But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic food is a healthier option.Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables,the government is at pains to stress that families should not waste their money on organic food.Just 30 percent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said,""Organic products provide a useful extension of consumer choice,but it is worth emphasizing that,nutritionally,they are no better and no worse than conventional products.The only benefit of organic farming was enjoyed by birds,insects,mammals and plants.""""It is up to the consumers to decide how they spend their money on their fruit and vegetables.There are many reasons why an individual might wish to choose organic products but nutritional benefit should not be one of them,""she added.

High school students _ after class.	English Students' Education English schools begin in September after a long summer holiday. There are two terms in a school year. The first term is from September to January, and the second term is from February to June. Most English children begin to go to school when they are five years old. When they finish high school, they are seventeen or eighteen years old. High school students take only five or six subjects each term. They usually go the the same class every day, and they have homework for every class. After class, they do a lot of interesting things. After high school, many students go to college1. They usually have to pay a lot of money. So they have to work after class to get money for their studies. Notes:1. go to college	['do interesting things']
"Why did the blind man shout out ""Don't flush! Don't flush!""?"	"There was once a blind man, who did a lot of traveling alone. He was making his first trip to Texas and happened to be seated next to a Texan on the flight. The Texan spent a lot of time telling him how everything was bigger and better in Texas. After the blind man reached his destination, a large resort hotel, he was very excited about being in Texas. The long trip had worn him out a little so he decided to stop at the bar for a small soda and a light snack before going up to his room to sleep. When the waitress set down his drink, it was in a huge cup. ""Wow, I had heard everything in Texas is bigger,"" he told her. ""That's right,"" she replied. The blind man ate his snack and finished his drink. After drinking such a large amount, it was natural that his next stop was to be the restroom. He asked the waitress for directions. She told him to turn left at the corner, and then take the second door on the right. He reached the first door and continued. A few steps later he stumbled slightly and missed the second door and ended up going through the third door instead. Not realizing he had entered the swimming area he walked forward and immediately fell into the swimming pool. Remembering that everything was bigger in Texas, he had his head above water and started shouting ""Don't flush ! Don't flush!"""

We can infer that DMV is _ .	One day I walked down to get to my car, thinking about what I had to accomplish and scolding myself for being late for work, but surprisingly the car was nowhere to be found. This was at 8 a.m. in the morning. I made trips to all the towing places and police stations, all the time thinking that it was towed by cops .By around 10 a.m., the cops decided that it was actually stolen. After filing a report with them, I finally got to work thinking how my day was completely messed up. Later in the day I went to pick up a rental car at Enterprise only to realize that my license was missing, too, along with my car. I told the enterprise guy the whole story and he offered to take me to the closest DMV and get a duplicate license. 1 was totally shocked. I did not know why this complete stranger would want to take some time off his day to help me. He actually took me to DMV, got a duplicate and then rented me a car. I was upset the whole day because of the events happening to me but somehow this simple act of kindness from a complete stranger made it all worth it. It cheered me up and made me forget all the troubles of the day. I was so moved by this kind act that the next day I made sure someone else got a similar surprise. I took some smiley shaped chocolates and left them on some of my colleagues' desks. There is still a lot of goodness out there in the world. We just need to take the time to notice it. I hope that this story would inspire many others like me to do more acts of kindness.	['an office for license']

Why do some companies ask the teens to do surveys?	Part-time jobs for 15 and 16 years olds Waiter / Waitress A job as a waiter or waitress is a good choice for 16-year-olds. Not only can one earn $9-$12 an hour, but they can also get the tips . Most people that visit a restaurant don't just have good food. They come here to relax and have a good time. Besides serving food quickly, a young waiter who talks to them politely with a smile on his face will make the diners enjoy their time at the restaurant. Work in a library If one is fond of books, working in a library is another suitable choice. Besides the pay is good, it offers a lot of free time when students can actually sit down and finish their homework. So on returning home, they would have time to hang around with friends or just relax. So working in a library is an excellent part-time job for teens, especially for school students. Internet jobs There are many ways of making money through online jobs like clicking on advertisements, visiting sites and signing up with them. However, such online jobs don't pay well. A better Internet job for teens is to complete online surveys. These are quite simple surveys that usually ask one about his/ her opinions and ideas.

The shortening of the dinner time in America is related to_.	In this century the traditional American family is constantly faced with the threat of breakdown. Some people suggest that one little - noticed cause may be the introduction of the TV dinner. Before the appearance of television seats, the American dinner was a big event for the family. In many homes dinner time may be the only time when everyone got together. A typical dinner was usually in three periods In the preparation period, the children and Father frequently helped with setting while Mother put the last touches on the roast. In the eating period, family members shared the day's experiences and more than food was eaten. In this period,families got to know one another and made joint decisions around the dinner table, and thus the family solidarity was strengthened. In the cleaning - up period,children or Father again gave their hands, so that their meaning to the home community was clear. Unfortunately, all of these have been abandoned by a product--the television set. By the beginning of the 1980s, the typical American family dinner was just twenty minutes long. The speed - up of this once - leisurely experiences is clearly connected to the overall pace of modern life and maybe a model of the modern life is the TV dinners--meals designed to be used between the opening and closing credits of a half - hour program. The once family affair has now become nothing more than the use of a fork and knife.	['the pace of modern life']
It could be inferred that the writer's wife is _ .	"After years of study, I have known there are only two types of people in this world:those who get to the airport early and those who arrive as the plane is about to take off. If there were any justice in this world, the early-airport people would be rewarded for doing the right thing and the late-airport people would be punished. But the early-airport people get ulcers , heart attacks and bite their fingernails to the bone. The late-airport people are hardly aware that they are flying. A guy of that kind once said, ""Don't hurry. If you miss your flight, it's because God didn't want you to go.""This is clearly a guy who is never going to get an ulcer. Early-airport people suffer another""name"". They are called exactly what they are--wimps . I know. I am an early-airport person for years. My luggage will get on the plane first, which makes it the last luggage they take off the plane after landing. Another strange thing:No matter how early I showed up, I was always told that someone had called two or three years ahead of me and asked for the best seat. I figured it was a trick. I figured there was someone in America who called every airline every day and said, ""Is that wimp Simon flying somewhere today? If he is, give me his seat. "" After a lifetime arguing with my wife over whether I really have to pack 24 hours in advance and set the alarm clock four hours ahead, I have learned another fact about early-airport people and late-airport people: They always marry each other."

How many inches were the legs of the new pants shortened by at last?	"A young man once went to buy a pair of pants. When he got home, he went upstairs to his bedroom and put them on. He found that they were two inches long. Then he came out of his room to see his mother and his two sisters. They were washing something in the kitchen.""These new pants are too long, they need to be shortened about two inches. Would one of you like to do this for me, please?"" His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything. The mother went upstairs after she had finished washing and shortened the pants two inches.

What can we infer from the passage?	Many psychologists in the early twentieth century believed that humans use only 10 percent of their brains, and even the great Albert Einstein once wrote that most people use only a small portion of the grey matter between their ears. It's a theory that has often been put forward in television documentaries; magazines, advertisements and books over the past century. But nearly all scientists now agree the 10 percent theory is completely . In fact, they question how this figure was ever arrived at in the first place and what areas of the brain are supposed to be unneeded. The theory supposes that if 90 percent of the brain were removed, a person would Still be able to function normally, while in reality it is known that damage to even a small area of the brain can result in extremely serious physical injury different activities and that many areas of the brain are used at the same time for some complex activities or thought processes. Throughout the course of one day, most .areas of the brain are active at some time, even during sleep. The 10 percent theory suggests that certain areas o' the brain are not used, but scans slow activities throughout the entire brain and not in any separate part. The final argument against the 10 percent theory is the fact that doctors carefully map the brain before removing brain cancers so that they don't affect other essential areas. From an evolutionary point of view, it's highly unlikely butt our comparatively larger brains would have evolved from our ancestors if the extra areas were not needed. In fact, there is absolutely no evidence support the 10 percent theory.	['Our understanding of the brain has changed greatly in the past decades.']

The recent study shows blind people are better at telling_.	"Where is that noise coming from? Not sure? Try living with your eyes closed for a few years. Blind people are better at locating sounds than people who can see, a new study says, Without the benefits of vision the ears seem to work much better. Previous studies have shown that blind people are better than others at reaching out and touching the sources of sounds that are close by. Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. Twenty-three blind people participated in the study. All had been sightless for at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had lost their vision before age 11. The rest went blind after age 16. The experiment also included 10 people who could see but were wearing blindfolds. In one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 meters away. When the sound was in front of them or slightly off center in front, both groups performed equally well. When sounds came from the side or the back, however, the blind group performed much better than the blindfolded group. The participants who had been blind since childhood did slightly better than those who lost their sight later. Recognizing the locations of distant sounds can be a matter of life-or-death for blind people, say the researchers. Crossing the street, for instance, is much harder when you can't see the cars coming. Still, the researchers were surprised by how well the blind participants did, especially those who went blind after age 16. In another experiment, the scientists also found that parts of the brain that normally deal with visual information became active in locating sound in the people who were blind by age 11. These brain parts didn't show sound-location activity in the other group of blind people or in the sighted people. The scientists now want to learn more about the workings of brains of ""late-onset"" blind people."	['the locations of distant sounds']
What is the function of the enzymes?	A town in Oxfordshire has become the first in the UK to have biomethane gas from human waste piped to their homes for gas central heating and cooking. Up to 200 families in Didcot now receive the gas via the national gas power system. Head of energy and technology at British Gas, Martin Orrill, said customers wouldn't notice any difference as the gas is purified to the highest standard and has no smell. The gas is produced at a sewage treatment works plant in Didcot. The entire process takes only less than three weeks, with the sewage being collected and sent first to settlement tanks. The solid waste material is then fed into digesters, where anaerobic bacteria digest the sewage, with the aid of enzymes to speed up the process. The digestion process produces methane, which can be burned to drive machines to produce electricity, or can be purified and fed into the gas network and piped to homes and businesses. British Gas says supplying the gas rather than electricity is far more efficient since around two-thirds of the energy is lost in producing electricity. Partners in the Didcot project, British Gas, Scotia Gas Networks, and Thames Water, all hope to expand the process to other towns, and other companies such as Ecotricity and United Utilities have also announced biomethane projects being planned. One of these projects, in Manchester, could be supplying 500 homes with biomethane by mid next year. Another British Gas project in Suffolk will provide gas from digestion of brewery wastes to around 235 families. The Didcot project cost PS2.5m and was influenced by promises of government aids aimed at encouraging companies to develop renewable technologies. An EU directive means the UK must ensure at least 15 percent of its energy is from renewable sources by 2020. The UK produces about 1.73 million tons of sewage annually. If all sewage treatment works in the UK were fitted with the technology, they could supply gas for up to 350,000 families.	['To speed up the digestion process.']
Which of the following can be the best title of the text?

Judy Kaczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA.Her daughter Tina was the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota.She said, ""Our daughter was a very outgoing child.She was a bubbly personality, very involved in all kinds of things, had lots of friends.And over a period of time her grades fell completely.She started having health issues.She couldn't sleep.She wasn't eating.She had terrible stomach pains.She started clenching her jaw and grinding her teeth at night.She didn't want to go to school."" Bullying is defined as negative behavior repeated over time against the same person. It can involve physical violence.Or it can be verbal -- for example, insults or threats.Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying. And now there is cyberbullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages.It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time. The first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s.The latest government study in the United States was released last year.It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school. Susan Sweater is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network.She says schools should treat bullying as a mental health problem to get bullies and victims the help they need.She says bullying is connected to depression, anxiety and anti-social behavior, and bullies are often victims themselves."

The moon's pull has a weak effect on the oceans on the opposite of the Earth,_.	"Many people have wondered what makes the oceans rise and fall on the word's beaches twice a day. Those tides are caused by the force of the Moon's gravity and the rotation of the Earth. Gravity acts on the center of any solid object. The Earth is mostly molten rock, but compared to the oceans, we can think of it as a solid object. As you know, the oceans are fluid and lie on the surface of the Earth. When the Moon is overhead, the oceans are four thousand miles closer to the Moon than the Earth's center is. Because the oceans are closer, the Moon pulls harder on the water than on the Earth. This stronger pull makes the water bunch up a little under the Moon, creating a high tide. At the same time, the oceans on the opposite side of the Earth are four thousand miles farther from the Moon than the Earth's center is. The Moon's pull on this water is weak. This water bunches up because it is ""left behind""(making another high tide) as the Earth is pulled slightly towards the Moon. When the waters bunch up on these two sides of the Earth, they draw water away from the other sides of the Earth, which creates the low tides. As the Earth rotates, different parts of the land and oceans pass through the high-tide and low-tide zones. And that makes the waters on our coasts go up and down."

Desert elephants are called careful feeders because they _ .	"How can a creature weighing over 5 tons and normally taking 150 kilograms of food and 120 liters of water per day survive in a desert environment? In the southwest African country of Namibia,and the Sahara lands of Mall further north,the desert elephant _ . Although not regarded as a separate species from the African elephant,the desert cousin differs in many ways.Their bodies are smaller,to absorb less heat,and their feet are larger for easier walking across sandy surfaces.They are taller,to reach higher branches.They have shortertusks ,and most importantly,longer trunks to dig for water in riverbeds. Desert elephants can travel over 70 kilometers in search for feeding grounds and water-holes,and have a larger group of families.They drink only every 3-4 days,and can store water in a ""bag"" at the back of their throat,which is only used when badly needed.Desert elephants are careful feeders--they seldom root up trees and break fewer branches,and thus maintain what little food sources are available.Young elephants may even eat thedung of the female leader of a group when facing food shortage. During drought they are unlikely to give birth to their young but with good rains the birthrate will increase greatly.Desert elephants have sand baths,sometimes adding their ownurine to make them muddy! As we continue to overheat our weak planet,it can only be hoped that other animal species will adapt as extraordinarily well to change as the desert elephant."	['rarely ruin trees']
It is likely that the writer _ .	Dear Flowermouse, Thank you for your comments on how Americans and Chinese view each other. This is an important subject. Modern technology has given many nations the chance of destroying other nations. This is a cruel picture but it is a realistic one. It means that every nation should make sure that these weapons of great destruction are never used. This requires greater acceptance of differences among people and nations in all parts of the planet. Your letter asks specially about Chinese-American relationships but I want to let you know my feelings on a global scale. Because China and America are the most powerful nations and I believe they have a special responsibility for promoting better understanding and for leading the way toward peaceful solutions to the world's problems. You ask how Chinese and American people view each other. This is an important question. Because I know so little about China that I am not able to judge how Chinese view Americans. I am sure that the view differs according to individual experiences that persons might have. And it is not easy to describe America to foreigners. America is a vast mass of people and cultures. These people came from all parts of the world, from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe and Australia. Each brought a different culture and a different set of values within a single nation. I believe that the vast majority of Americans like the vast majority of Chinese want peace and friendship between our two nations. Both China and America have suffered through generations from war and violence in our history. And I believe that it is the special responsibility of all Chinese and all Americans to impress this need for mutual understanding on our neighbors in other. So my friend, this is my response. Please know that I write to you as a private person living in America. I do feel strongly that people everywhere have more in common than they have in differences. We all share the same basic needs for existence and we all depend upon the same need for the survival of this beautiful planet earth. Maybe we can begin to encourage better communication and better understanding through my columns. I hope so.	['thinks it possible for nations to be destroyed due to modern technology']
The author threw bottles out of the car window because he wanted to _ .	"Here in the northeast Georgia mountains live an old man and his young grandson. A small sum of money given by the government is their only regular income. Man and boy walk up and down the highway daily collecting soft-drink bottles for resale. I stopped once, and tried to give the man a carton of empty bottles. Polite, but firmly, he refused my ""charity"". Exercising what I thought was the only reasonable matter. I was driving their part of road, throwing bottles out of the car window, when the flashing blue light of a Georgia State Patrol car filled my mirror. I took my lecture on litter laws, and then told the officer about the man and the boy. We could see the old man from where we were stopped, bending over to pick up a bottle. The officer warned me again, and told me to move on. As we both pulled onto the road, I looked in my mirror just in time to see two bottles sail out of the passenger window of the patrol car and land unbroken on the grass."	['help the man and the boy']
From the passage we know _ .	What do Napoleon, Clinton and Wang Nan have in common? They are all left-handed. Today about 15% of the people are left-handed. But why are people left-handed? The answer is the way the brain works. The brain has two halves---the right half and the left half. The right half controls the left side of the body, and the left half controls the right side of the body. So right-handed people have a strong left brain, and the left -handed people have a strong right brain. The two halves of the brain are about the same size. But each side controls different things. The left side controls language, Maths and logic . When you remember new words, or when you put things in order, you use your left side. The right side of the brain controls colour and music. It is also good at recognizing faces. This does not mean that all artists are left-handed and all accountants are right-handed. Some right-handers have a strong right brain, and some left-handers have a strong left brain.	['some right-handers have a strong left brain']
The financial education in England aims to _ .	"Are you good with money?I learnt to be careful with it during my childhood. My father would give me some pocket money and tell me it should last for a whole week. So,I learnt I had to save some if I didn't want to run out of cash quickly. No surprise there:my dad was an accountant! It's never too early to become money savvy .That's what British personal finances expert Martin Lewis thinks. He was part of a successful campaign to include financial education on the school curriculum in England. It will be embedded in maths and citizenship education. This includes children from 5 to 16 years old. Lewis says:""We desperately need to break the cycle of financial illiteracy in the UK--one of the causes of our current economic crisis and a huge contributor to continued mis-selling epidemics ."" Being careful with money pays off. Banks in Britain recently found themselves having to pay a large number of people who were persuaded to spend money and buy insurance policies they didn't need. Many wasted their money on investments which were not for them. Few have the patience to read the small print. The British say'take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves'.It means you have to watch your daily expenses and not just the big purchases in your life such as houses. Martin Lewis has made millions from his website which advises people to be thrifty and refuses any suggestion that he is mean. The expert says in an interview with the English newspaper the Daily Express:""the better you are with your cash,the better your life can be. People think I am telling them to stop spending money but I am simply telling them to spend it wisely."""	['educate children to become money savvy']

What's the population of Mars in the future?	Do you like traveling? Have you traveled to Los Angeles? Have you traveled to the moon? A rich man plans to live on Mars. Is it the beginning of a science fiction novel? In fact, it happens in the real world. Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of a private spaceflight company. He has said his plan is to live on the planet. He says he plans to live on Mars with a group of fewer than ten people. He will take them on a rocket powered by liquid oxygen and methane . Each one should pay $ 500,000 to fly there. However, these passengers are not going there to travel, but they are going to work. They need to carry tools to build houses and grow crops there. Musk believes one person out of every 100,000 people may be interested in making the journey. Then Mars will have sixty-three thousand people in the future.	['63,000']
What does the article mainly talk about?	Making sense of how the US shows humor Living in a new country gives me many surprises. The first surprise was the way that the US people speak One day I saw someone was having a public speech in a square. I thought it would be a serious speech. But I soon found it became a kind of entertainment show. The speaker told the audience to protect the environment with humorous words. Later he said some people's behavior didn't go with their words. He took the example of Taylor Swift's song We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.[ He said that since Swift doesn't want to be with the boy any more, she doesn't need to speak it aloud, she doesn't need to sing unless she still keeps in touch with that guy. It sounds like she is a _ . Then he sang the song in a funny way. The audience laughed out loudly. I felt a little angry because Swift is my favourite star. I couldn't understand why they laughed at Swift. As time goes on, I find many US people make fun of others. But they don't mean to hurt them. They do that to show closeness and humour. And people who are laughed at seldom get angry. Now I understand the speaker at the square. Now I've got used to the way the US people speak. It's easy to find culture shock when you're in a new place. But everyone should learn to understand different cultures and customs.	"[""A Chinese girl's culture shock experience in the US.""]"

Sue O'Connor's study advanced the date of humans' fishing in the open sea by _ .	"The world's earliest known fish hooks show that humans fished in the open sea for much longer than previously thought. Past studies have shown that early humans were able to cross the open ocean as far back as 50,000 years ago, but evidence that they could fish while in the open sea dated back only to 12,000 years ago. ""In most areas of the world, evidence for our early ancestors' coastal exploitation was drowned by rising sea level,"" said researcher Sue O'Connor. Now O'Connor and her colleagues have found evidence of prehistoric fishing tools and the remains of large fish such as tuna at a cave shelter known as Jerimalai, located in the Southeast Asian island nation of East Timor. Their discovery uncovered fishing hooks made from bone that dated back to about 42,000 years ago. ""It's possible that people caught the tuna in the deep channel that lies off the coast of the Jerimalai shelter,"" O'Connor said. The site, first uncovered in 2005, also included bone points, shell beads, the remains of fish, turtles, bats and birds, and nearly 10,000 stone tools. The island of Timor has very few land animals overall and only small birds call the island home, perhaps explaining why the ancient people here went fishing. About half the fish remains at the site came from fish such as tuna. Catching such fast-moving fish requires much planning and complex technology, suggesting that early humans developed these skills earlier than previously thought. Some other scientists might say that most of the fish bones seen are from young fish, and thus might have been caught more easily off the coast as opposed to in open waters. While this may be the case, it's still not easy to catch tuna -- it requires nets set in deep water."	['30,000 years']
The author writes the passage mainly to _ .	"Are extraverts really better leaders? Can an introvert be a good leader? Research has shown a consistent positive relationship between extraversion and leadership. In groups of strangers,such as a jury , extraversion predicts who will be selected foreperson of the jury. It's actually likely to be the person who talks the most,and that person is probably an extravert. So, extraverts are more likely to be chosen for leadership positions (what we call leader ""emergence""). There is also a positive relationship (although a weaker one) between extraversion and leader effectiveness, particularly evaluated effectiveness of leaders. So it appears that extraverts have _ an _ edge, _ but does this mean that introverts can't be good leaders? Of course not ! Many successful leaders are introverted, for example Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, and in business, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. One of the best company presidents that I've known was easily the most introverted person among his executive team, but he was very successful and his colleagues admired his ""quiet reserve and confidence"". So what is the critical factor that both extraverts and introverts need to emerge as a leader and to be effective? Our research has suggested that the key element is good interpersonal, or social, skills. In one study,we looked at the relationship of extraversion to leadership emergence and effectiveness and found that the advantage that extraverts had disappeared when we put social skills into the equation . In other words,only extraverts who possessed social skills were effective leaders. Good interpersonal skills are critical whether the leader is an extravert or an introvert. In addition,we know that we are more likely to choose leaders who look like their prototypes of leaders--they speak well, interact well with others, and just look ""leader-like"". Extraverts just naturally look more like a prototypical leader, particularly political leaders, than do introverts. Think of the U.S. presidential campaign where presidential hopefuls were evaluated for how much each looked like he or she could be the Commander-in-Chief. The key to leadership success then is to develop the people skills needed to look like a leader, but to also develop the good leader-follower relationships that are necessary for success. If you possess these skills,introversion and extraversion don't matter very much."	['argue that introverts can also be good leaders']

What is the best title of the passage?	"I was having a great morning until I sat down in front of my office computer. ""Your password has run out,"" a server message flashed on my screen, with instructions for changing it. Coming up with a new code doesn't seem like a big deal unless you work at my company, where we have to change it monthly, using at least one uppercase character, one lowercase character, one symbol, and one number. Oh, and the whole thing can't be fewer than eight characters. And I can't use any of the same passwords I've used in the past three months. Suddenly I was cross. What didn't make it any better was that I was deeply depressed after my recent divorce. The flashing cursor was still waiting for me to type a password that I'd have to re-enter many times for the next 30 days. I remembered a tip from my former boss: I'm going to use a password to change my life. I decided to choose a password, which would remind me that I shouldn't let myself be a victim of my recent breakup and that I was strong enough to do something about it. I made my password Forgive@h3r. I had to type this statement several times a day. Each time my computer would lock. Each time my screen saver with her photo would appear. Each time I would come back from eating lunch alone. In my mind, I wrote ""forgive her"" every day. The simple action changed the way I looked at my ex-wife. That constant reminder led me to accept the way things had happened at the end of my marriage and adopt a new way of dealing with my depression. As the month wore on, I felt slow healing began to take place. By the time my server reminded me to reset my password the following month, I felt free."	['How a Password Changed My Life']

What do we know about PPAR-gamma 1? _	"Dust on furniture may be bad news for waistlines . But it's far too early to add dusting to a weight-loss plan. Dietary fats and other materials that make up indoor dust can send a signal to human fat cells, telling them to grow. That process, in turn, might slow the body's rate of burning energy. Such changes could add to any weight problems a person might have. ""We don't know what that means to long-term health and certain diseases yet,"" says Heather Stapleton, one of the study's authors. But she notes that her team's findings also raise a question of whether pollutants in dust might play some role in the growing, global problem of obesity . Stapleton and her colleagues collected dust from homes and offices. Studies found that some materials in the dust could turn on a protein called PPAR-gamma 1. It's found in many human tissues. Turning this protein on can cause fat cells to grow. Researchers think this protein may be involved in obesity. But a second study now finds evidence that certain fats are mostly to blame. Cooking oils may send out some of these fats into the air, where they eventually find their way into house dust. Or, the authors say, the fats might enter house dust as part of the hair or skin cells shed by people or pets. ""While the findings are amazing,"" says Mitchell Lazar, another study author, ""these findings need to be taken as very limited."" Indeed, he adds several cautions about how the findings should be understood. ""For one thing, people eat these fats in foods all of the time. That is likely to be a lot more than would be consumed from indoor dust,"" he said."	['It leads to weight gain.']

He took her back to his hotel, and when he came to himself in the morning, the lady and the dispatch-case had disappeared.

Where can we most probably read this passage?	like many other fruit,Cherries are packed with antioxidants that may help to prevent cancer and heart disease,as well as slow the aging process.Perhaps you've heare about the controversy between the FD(Food and Drug Administration)and the cherry industry and wondered what it was all about.Are cherries not as healthy to eat as you thought they were?Should you stop eating cherries?The answer is no. The controversy is over certain health claims made by the cherry industry and those who sell products made from cherries,such as pills,capsules and juice,not the health benefits of cherries themselves. While many scientific studies have demonstrated the health benefits of cherries, the FDA says that makers of products containing cherries cannot claim that their products prevent, treat or cure a specific disease such as cancer. For the general population, however, the bottom line is that there is no reason not to eat cherries. There are two types of cherry: sweet and sour . Sweet cherries are often sold fresh in grocery stores. Sour cherries are canned and used in pies, and dried to be made into fruit snacks and juice. Like most other fruit,cherries are fat-free, low in calories and high in certain minerals and vitamins. They can be eaten raw, cooked or juiced; if you want year-round cherry enjoyment, they are also easy to can and enjoy at your convience. Most scientific research has centered on the health benefits of sour cherries. Sour cherries are among the top fruit as far as antioxidant levels go. According to one study, eating 20 sour cherries a day could provide the same pain relief that aspirin does. Researchers in Texas recently discovered that sour cherries contain high levels of melatonin , something produced by the body that is thought to help slow the aging process as. well as control sleep. Cherries may lower blood sugar levels and help to significantly reduce pain due to muscle damage.	['In a life magazine.']
What's the main purpose of the article?	Unlike chemists and physicists, who usually do their experiments using machines, biologists and medical researchers have to use living things like rats. But there are three Nobel prize-winning scientists who actually chose to experiment on themselves - all in the name of science, reported The Telegraph. 1. Werner Forssmann (Nobel prize winner in 1956) Forssmann was a German scientist. He studied how to put a pipe inside the heart to measure the pressure inside and decide whether a patient needs surgery. Experiments had been done on horses before, so he wanted to try with human patients. But it was not permitted because the experiment was considered too dangerous. Not giving up, Forssmann decided to experiment on himself. He anaesthetized his own arm and made a cut, putting the pipe 30 centimeters into his vein. He then climbed two floors to the X-ray room before pushing the pipe all the way into his heart. 2. Barry Marshall (Nobel prize winner in 2005) Most doctors in the mid-20th century believed that _ was down to stress, spicy food or an unusually large amount of stomach acid. But in 1979 an Australian scientist named Robin Warren found that the disease might be related to a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. So he teamed up with his colleague, Barry Marshall, to continue the study. When their request to experiment on patients was denied, Marshall bravely drank some of the bacteria. Five days later, he lost his appetite and soon was vomiting each morning - he indeed had gastritis. 3. Ralph Steinman (Nobel prize winner in 2011) This Canadian scientist discovered a new type of immune system cell called the dendritic cell. He believed that it had the ability to fight against cancer. Steinman knew he couldn't yet use his method to treat patients. So in 2007, when doctors told him that he had cancer and that it was unlikely for him to live longer than a year, he saw an opportunity. With the help of his colleagues, he gave himself three different vaccines based on his research and a total of eight experimental therapies. Even though Steinman eventually died from his cancer, he lived four and a half years, much longer than doctors had said he would.

Maybe you don't want to make friends with a person who sleeps curled up. Why?	Everyone has got two personalities - the one that is shown to the world and the other that is secret and real. You don't show your secret personality when you're awake because you can control your behavior, but when you're asleep, your sleeping position shows the real you. In a normal night, of course, people frequently change their position. The important position is the one that you go to sleep in. If you go to sleep on your back, you're a very open person. You normally trust people and you are easily influenced by fashion or new ideas. You don't like to upset people, so you never express your real feelings. You're quite shy and you aren't very confident. If you sleep on your stomach, you are a rather secretive person. You worry a lot and you're always easily upset. You're very stubborn, but you aren't very ambitious. You usually live for today not for tomorrow. This means that you enjoy having a good time. If you sleep on curled up, you are probably a very nervous person. You have a low opinion of yourself and so it is easy for you to get angry. You're shy and you don't normally like meeting people. You prefer to be on your own. You're easily hurt. If you sleep on your side, you have usually got a well-balanced personality. You know your strengths and weakness. You're usually careful. You have a confident personality. You sometimes feel anxious, but you don't often get upset. You always say what you think even if it makes people angry.

""Doing it online allows people quite a lot of privacy, because they can do a bit of quiet research and look around from the comfort of their own home. You don't have to meet a middleman or go to an actual dating agency office, which takes a lot of courage,"" she said. There are more than 100 independent online dating agencies in Britain. Parship says that 50 percent of single people believe they will meet a suitable partner through the Internet, up from 35 percent six months ago. Mary Balfour, the founder, says that the Internet has changed the dating industry completely. ""It's like a return to old-fashioned love letters,"" she said. ""You don't base your initial judgment on how someone looks or what his or her figure is like. You e-mail or talk before you actually see each other. Everybody you know who is single these days has at least had a good look at a dating website, introduction agency or personal ad. They have to, because all the old matchmaking institutions have gone. People work harder, settle down later and live more isolated lives. They're much more likely to end the day with a DVD and a can of beer than by going to a village dance."""

What's the relationship between the Royal Jelly takers?	With their weakening bodies, advanced age or increasing pressure of work or study, people have been advised and usually persuaded to have health care products. Do you remember your first time to take a nutritional supplement ? What was your first impression? Posted by Amy, Dec.23, 2010 8:05 P.M. Madeline on Dec.24, 2010 7:25 P.M. Years ago, as a young mom with two small children, I struggled to keep up with the demands of a busy life. One day, I woke up feeling so tired that I knew something had to change! A friend gave me some Royal Jelly--an amazing substance from the beehive .I was doubtful, but desperate...so I tried it! In time, I began to experience renewed energy like never before! Now, over two decades later, I travel all round the country, sharing my lifechanging experience. I'm grateful for the energy to keep up and love to share this wonderful discovery with others. Blanca on Dec.25, 2010 7:02 P.M. Ten years ago, when I was 73, my mind wanted to be busy and useful, but my body didn't. I became very tired. That's when my daughter Madeline tried to persuade me to try her special Royal Jelly. It made great difference in her life, so she was sure it could help me too! Hesitating for 2 days, I gave in. She was right! I no longer felt worn out. I had a new, youthful eagerness for life and I've been OK--thanks to Royal Jelly! Lori on Dec.25, 2010 10:27 P.M. When my mom Madeline was introduced to Royal Jelly, it affected my life, too! Mom gave me some of her fantastic Royal Jelly. Boy, things did turn around! I had more energy and _ and was finally able to keep up with high school and, eventually, college activities. Today, I'm a busy mom in my mid thirties with two active boys and a new business! I have enough energy to do it all! I'm glad I took my Mom's advice.	"[""Madeline is Blanca's daughter and Lori's mother.""]"

"Suhas Gopinath's website ""coolhindustani"" was supported by _ ."	"Fourteen is not an age at which you try to earn millions of dollars. But for Bangalore boy, Suhas Gopinath, it was. One day in August, 1999, Suhas, studying at the Air Force School in Hebbal, was surfing the Net at a cyber cafe. He happened to hit an MSN source code . That made him decide to learn more about HTML and to design and set up his own website under the address of a US-based company, Network Solutions. He kept updating his website, posting interesting things on it. This impressed Network Solutions and they invited him to attend a class on Web design and development. His mom and uncle criticised him for not taking his education seriously. But gradually, his dad started encouraging him and even bought him a computer and Net connection. In fact, that was his first investment in the company. On May 14, 2000, along with friends Clifford Leslie and Binay M. N, he floated his own website -- www.coolhindustani.com. He did not have the money to start, for his parents refused to give him a penny. So he wrote to Network Solutions Inc. in the US and they readily agreed. In August, the same year, he set up Globals Inc., a Web solutions and networking company, with a team of four. Now, he has 400 employees, more than 200 customers across the globe and offices in 11 countries, and he is worth over $100 million. After finishing his high school education, he studied at Stanford University for two years. But Suhas says: ""Education alone will not make a good professional ."""	['an American company']

What can we conclude from the article?	"After spending three days in a wheelchair, I was ready to quit. Not only did I have to battle cracked and uneven pavements, I had to deal with the bad attitude of pedestrians and a cold rain. But I didn't give up because of people like Tiffany Payne. Payne, who has been using a wheelchair for 18 years, laughed at me, ""Imagine trying to get around town in the winter,"" she said. I could see her point: You're battling to get to a doctor's appointment, but no one has shoveled after a big snowfall. Your choices: Move out and risk getting stuck, or reschedule the appointment. Those of us fortunate enough to get around on our own two legs don't give a second thought to the person in a wheelchair next to us at a crosswalk. That would require us to look down. So I decided to try using a wheelchair to get a sample of what their lives are like. It wasn't long before I saw that people who use wheelchairs are forced to deal with a lot of trouble. During my experiment, I was ignored by store staff while shopping and bumped into by inattentive walkers without so much as an apology. Some people even gave me angry looks as if I were the one at fault. Once in a store, a woman bumped into me trying to get to the new iPad. She didn't say, ""Excuse me."" When salespeople did offer assistance, they talked to people who were with me, instead of me. I wanted to yell, ""Hey, I'm down here!"" Some salespeople talked to me as though I were a child or acted like they didn't want to be bothered with me. People who use wheelchairs want to be treated like everyone else. They also comprehend, so you don't have to speak to them in a childlike, sing-song voice. It's not very appealing, especially when the person is an adult. And most importantly, remember they have feelings that can be hurt just like yours. Spending three days in a wheelchair made me look differently at those who have to use one. I hope you do the same."

Dressing up can help kids to develop their _ .	During the seasons of fine weather, kids can play outside, happy and active. But when winter comes around, it is wet, windy and cold. Since they can't go outside to play, kids get restless and miserable. Fun activities for kids are pretty much necessary at that time of year, and they need to be kept entertained. One way to do this is to have an indoor treasure hunt, where children can look for clues and then get to the treasure. Treasure doesn't even need to be much, because just the activity is fun enough. Art activities are always fun, and if you start off with some paper in different colors they can draws shapes on the back, cut them out and stick them on the white paper to make all sorts of things. Cardboard boxes, stuck together and then painted, can be made into buildings or robots. You can keep all boxes in a bag in the loft. Then you have something you can draw on when the weather is bad and the children need to play indoors. Dressing up is another fun indoor activity. Why not read a book to them and then ask them to act it for you? That can keep them busy and develop their imagination. When you encourage children to use their imagination, you are giving them confidence in themselves, in their own creative abilities; by suggesting they put on a play you are encouraging them to work together and develop teamwork skills. The best way to help your kids have fun when it is rainy outside is to let them come up with some ideas. When you feel that they are old enough, let them write their ideas on a piece of paper and you can pick an idea that you find practical. That way, every day can be fun!

In England, the birthday present is opened _ .	In England, we look forward to our birthdays for 364 days a year! We invite special people to celebrate it with us. The Presents Presents are opened as soon as the children are awake. They can't wait for the birthday cake later in the day! The Cards Friends and family send birthday cards. Sending birthday cards is a custom that began in England about 100 years ago. The Party The birthday child will have a party to which friends and family are invited. Visitors to the party bring presents for the birthday child. The children play games such as musical chairs and pass the parcel . The Cake The birthday cake is decorated on a theme . A candle for each year is lit and placed on top and the child blows out the candles making a wish. We don't put objects inside the cake as stated on many websites. The Bumps It used to be traditional for the birthday child to have the bumps. Friends would hold the child by the legs and under the arms and lift the child up and down bumping them gently on the ground. The number of bumps given is the age of the child plus one for extra good luck. As this can be dangerous, clapping is often done instead. The Sweets Some children do take sweets to school to share with their classmates on their birthdays.	['immediately after the child wakes up']
Which of the sentences below is NOT true?	A science book gives facts. Some science books tell us about animals. Some tell us about plants. Some tell us about outer space. This page tells us about animals. Do you know that not only the fish but also some animals live in the sea? For example, the whale is not a fish. It can't breathe in the water. It swims in the water. But it comes up for air. The blue whale is the world's biggest animal. There are other sea animals, too. One is called the dolphin. Dolphins need air to live. They breathe air, as whales do. Dolphins are very clever. They sometimes seem to speak to each other. Many other animals live near the sea. Seals and otters love the sea. They swim and play there. They eat fish and sea plants. Seals and otters have thick fur. The fur keeps them warm.	['The whale can breathe in the sea like a fish.']
Which of the following expressions could be used to tell someone to stay away from your private affairs?	"The nose is used in many popular expressions. Some people are able to lead other people by the nose. For example, if a wife leads her husband by the nose, she makes him do whatever she wants him to do. Some people are said to be hard-nosed. They will not change their opinions or positions on anything. It is always helpful when people keep their nose out of other people's business. They do not interfere . The opposite of this is someone who noses around all the time. Such people are interested in other people's private matters. They're considered nosy. Someone who keeps his nose to the grindstone works very hard. This can help a worker keep his nose clean or stay out of trouble. One unusual expression is that is no skin off my nose. This means that a situation doesn't affect or concern me. We also say that sometimes a person cuts off his nose to spite his face. That is, he makes a situation bad for himself by doing something foolish because he is angry. More problems can develop if a person looks down his nose at someone or something. The person acts as if something is unimportant or worthless. This person might also turn up his nose at something that he considers not good enough. This person thinks he is better than everyone else. He has his nose in the air. In school, some students thumb their nose at their teacher. They refuse to obey orders or do any work. Maybe the students do not know the correct answers. My mother always told me when I was a student, ""If you study hard, the answers should be right under your nose or easily seen."""

What is the main idea of the passage?	"Picture a wasteland of old computer monitors and TVs, stretching as far as the eye can see. Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and discarded electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country. Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place . ""We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later ,"" Lauren Roman , managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech-trash is produced each year in the U.S. What's behind the tech trash pile-up ?About ten years ago ,major advances were made in computer and television technology . Manufacturers began producing devices like flat -paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy glass-based technologies. The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs. CRTs have a high lead content and can be environmentally hazardous if not recycled properly . If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CUTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors. Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes . ""People are returning old -style TVs with CRTs , but no new ones are being made ,"" said Linnell. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space to process these materials. This results in stockpiling. However , experts say there are ways to safely and responsibly address the tech-trash problem."	['New technology causes trouble for recyclers.']
Alice made up her mind to be a nurse _ .	"My friend Alice decided to be a nurse when she was four years old. She always to play at ""doctors and nurses"" with her playmates. When she left school last year, she still wanted to be a real nurse. Late September she started her studies in a big hospital in Newcastle. She had to work very hard. She went to classes every day and studied late at night. Then a really important day came: her first day in a ward . At last she was really helping sick people, not just sitting in classes or learning from books. At first, student nurses do lots of odd jobs in the ward. They help to serve meals, or wash the patients. They also keep the ward tidy and make the beds. But they cannot give injections or help the doctors. One of Alice's first jobs was in a ward of old people. She was told to clean all the patients' false teeth. She collected all the teeth and took them to the bathroom. Instead of cleaning each set of teeth one by one, she put them all into a big bowl. ""It'll be quicker this way,"" she said to herself. ""Then I can give back everyone's teeth in a few minutes."" Give back everyone's teeth! Alice stood in the middle of the ward with her big bowl of teeth. She had no idea which teeth belonged to which old man!

The author thinks that helping a victim can be _ .	We all know how important human life is--it's priceless. It doesn't matter where you are from or what the color of your skins is--all people are human beings. Firstly, we can tell you that the lives of your relatives could depend on your ability to give first aid. If you think highly of human's life, this website is for you! Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take actions that help to bring back the heart beat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly. Always provide the following information: the location of the accident, the kind of accident, the number of the injured and your full name and phone number and so on.[:]	['risky']
Which of the following would be the best title for the text?	"Something in chocolate could be used to stop coughs and lead to more effective medicines, say UK researchers. Their study found that theobromine , found in cocoa, was nearly a third more effective in stopping coughs than codeine, which was considered the best cough medicine at present. The Imperial College London researchers who published their results online said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatment. ""While coughing is not necessarily harmful it can have a major effect on the quality of life, and this discovery could be a huge step forward in treating this problem,"" said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine or placebo, a pill that contains no medicine, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medicines are stopping coughs. The team found that, when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo. The researchers said that theobromine worked by keeping down a nerve activity , which cause coughing. They also found that unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine caused no side effects such as sleepiness."	['Chocolate May Cure Coughs']
Prof. Murray and Dr. Minor became friends mainly because _ .	"One of the greatest contributions to the first Oxford English Dictionary was also one of its most unusual. In 1879, Oxford University in England asked Prof. James Murray to serve as editor for what was to be the most ambitious dictionary in the history of the English language. It would include every English word possible and would give not only the definition but also the history of the word and quotations showing how it was used. This was a huge task. So Murrary had to find volunteers from Britain, the United States, and the British colonies to search every newspaper, magazine, and book ever written in English. Hundreds of volunteers responded, including William Chester Minor. Dr. Minor was an American Surgeon who had served in the Civil War and was now living in England. He gave his address as ""Broadmoor, Crowthorne, Berkshire,"" 50 miles from Oxford. Minor joined the army of volunteers sending words and quotations to Murray. Over the next years, he became one of the staff's most valued contributors. But he was also a mystery. In spite of many invitations, he would always decline to visit Oxford. So in 1897, Murray finally decided to travel to Crowthorne himself. When he arrived, he found Minor locked in a book-lined cell at the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally insane. Murray and Minor became friends, sharing their love of words. Minor continued contributing to the dictionary, sending in more than 10,000 submissions in 20 years. Murray continued to visit Minor regularly, sometimes taking walks with him around the asylum grounds. In 1910, Minor left Broadmoor for an asylum in his native America. Murray was at the port to wave goodbye to his remarkable friend. Minor died in 1920, seven years before the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary was completed. The 12 volumes defined 414,825 words, and thousands of them were contributions from a very scholarly and devoted asylum patient."	['They had a common interest in words']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"There are over 800 boarding schools in the UK with students from home and foreign countries. Boarding schools started hundreds of years ago in the country. But the earliest boarding schools were set up for white, rich boys only. Now both boys and girls can go to boarding schools from the age of 7 to 18. What to do In the UK, boarding schools have three terms in a school year, with about 13 weeks in each term. Students study and live together. They can't go outside if they are not allowed to. In some schools, each student has his or her subject plan. Besides the usual classrooms and laboratories, the boarding schools have lots of other _ for their students, including music rooms, boats, swimming pools, cinemas and theatres. Most boarding schools have a ""light out"" time. So when it's time to go to bed, all the lights in the bedrooms are turned off. There are house-masters to take care of students all the time, especially after school hours. What to wear Nearly all students at boarding schools wear a school uniform. Boys usually wear a shirt and a tie, and girls wear a white blouse, sometimes also a tie and a skirt. As students get older, the rules become less strict. _ In the UK, boarding schools provide students with delicious food. They can choose to have a full English breakfast or simply bread. They can also choose between a meal with no meat and another meal at lunch and dinner. And there is always self-service for salad , other side dishes and a dessert. Students can also make themselves something to eat at any time in a kitchen, or drink tea or have a snack between meals."	['Students can have different activities in a boarding school.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	The worst danger is a house on fire when people are asleep. Always be ready to leave through a window into the garden by making sure you can open it if necessary. If you should be on holiday in a tall building or hotel, make sure you know where the fire escape is . When you can't find any way out, try to find pieces of cloth and make a rope to get out of a window to safety. If you smell burning in your home, get out right away. If you can't breathe properly because of smoke on your way out, crawl on your hands and knees because smoke rises and the air will be cleaner near the floor. Smoke is a killer and more people have died from breathing it in than actually being burnt. Fire in a cinema, hall or public place often means people pushing to reach a door. Keep your head up with arms up in front of your chest .This protects your chest and gives you the best chance to breathe. Above all, don't get frightened!

What did scientists discover in their experiment in the 20th century?	"Have you ever heard that we humans use only ten percent of our brains? This opinion holds a certain appeal because if it were true, then we could instantly become ten times more intelligent just by firing up that sleepy majority of the brain! The idea that we use only a small part of the brain dates back to animal experiments in the 19th century. When scientists stimulated a specific part of the brain, the animal moved its leg or tail. If a tiny part of the brain could do something so great, what was the use of the rest of the brain? Some scientists assumed that large parts of the brain were simply useless. Then, in the early 20th century, scientists observed that stimulating certain parts of the brain had no physical effects. They named these seemingly useless parts of the brain the ""silent cortex."" Today we know that in humans, much of the ""silent cortex"" is actually devoted to complex activities like language, learning, and imagining. Brain scans have shown that different parts of the brain become much more active as we shift our attention and focus, but even as we sleep, many areas of the brain are extremely active. Would you be smarter if your entire brain constantly worked to maximum capacity ? Interestingly enough, the opposite is probably true. The less brain activity you need to perform a given task, the more the brain as a whole is able to do."	['Stimulation on some parts of the brain causes no physical reaction.']
What does the author think of the wilderness areas around the world in the book?	More than 200 scientists have completed a twoyear study to identify the most natural and undeveloped areas on Earth. Their findings are reported in a new book called Wilderness:Earth's Last Wild Places. The book describes 37 wilderness areas around the world. Each has an area greater than 10,000 square kilometers. The study considered only areas where at least 70% of all plants are native. North and South America are home to the largest number of wilderness areas. There are 16 such areas, from southern Argentina to Alaska and northern Canada. Africa has 8 wilderness areas, including the thick forests and the grasslands. Australia and New Guinea share 6 areas. Europe has 3 areas and Asia has 2.The Arabian Desert and Antarctica also are considered wilderness areas. The largest wilderness area is the Boreal Forest .It extends for 16million square kilometers south of the Arctic Circle. The Boreal Forest extends across Alaska, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. The smallest of the 37 wilderness areas is the Sundarbans. It is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest .It covers 10,000 square kilometers of land at the mouth of the Ganges River in India and Bangladesh . The study found that wilderness areas cover about 46% of the Earth's land surface. However, they are home to less than 2.5% of the world's population. Nineteen of the wilderness areas have only about one person for each square kilometer. Native people usually live in these areas. Wilderness areas help to influence the world's weather systems and rainfall. They are also home to many plants and animals. Population growth and the spread of agriculture and mining operations threaten wilderness areas. But just 7% of all such areas have some form of official protection.	['Valuable']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Over time, the custom of kissing developed as a way for adults to express their love and affection for one another. The roots of this form of affection can be traced back to primitive times, when mothers fondled their children, much as mothers do today. Much later, in the sixth century, society apparently accepted the custom of kissing between adults as an expression of their affection. Not surprisingly, France first accepted kissing in courtship . There, figure dancing was popular, and each dance was sealed with a kiss. The custom of kissing swept from France through Europe to Russia, where Russian nobility loved to imitate the French. Eventually, the kiss was incorporated into marriage ceremonies, and today lip locks couples into sweet matrimony. The custom of kissing today, as well as in ancient times, serves to pay _ to another. Early Romans kissed each other on the mouth or on the eyes to greet one another in a manner they thought to be dignified. One Roman emperor even ranked a person's importance by the body part he was allowed to kiss. He allowed important nobles to kiss his lips, less important ones to kiss his hands, and the least important ones to kiss his feet. In Russia, the highest sign of recognition from the Crown meant a kiss from the Tsar himself. Today, natives of many African tribes pay homage to their Chief by kissing the ground over which he has walked.	['Russian nobility followed the custom of kissing from the French.']

""British people are told, it won't happen to you. And they carry that. They carry that with them. We champion the underdog ."" It's no wonder that Britons hold the reputation of having a ""stiff upper lip"" - being cold and not showing any emotion. Britain's reputation as a grumpy country may, however, simply be the result of a cultural misunderstanding. According to the BBC, British actor Michael Caine once said: ""I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. English people are always known to be well-mannered and cold, but we are not cold - we don't _ your situation. If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own. It's completely to do with your comfort - we don't intrude on your space. That's very English."" A BBC reader noted that the perceived coldness of British people is actually their way of dealing with hardship. Remembering the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005, Stuart Colley, who lived in the capital at the time, said: ""It seemed to me that most people's response was a 'cruel' determination to carry on and not to 'fall' into an over-emotional outpouring of grief or anger - despite what many of us felt inside. Our stiff upper lip seems to be something that gives us strength as a society when we most need it."""	['show how not giving in to emotions can help one to get through a tough time']
Which one is RIGHT?	"Wang Bing is a 12-year-old boy. He likes sports very much and does well in sports. One afternoon, he comes out of the classroom and sees his father waiting for him at the school gate. He is very glad and he runs to his father. ""Dad, please don't wait for me after school next time. I can go home by myself . I have grown up."" says Wang Bing. ""Let's go,"" says the father, ""I'll cook supper and you can do your homework at home: Mum is still at work.""On their way home, Wang Bing sees some boys skating in a park. ""Can I go and learn skating. Dad?"" asks Wang Bing. ""I'm sorry, my boy. You must go home and do your homework,"" answers his father, ""but I can buy you an ice-cream.""

At the sight of the author, the rattlesnake_.	After sunset on our last day at the farm I walked out into the desert. In this, the first pleasant moment for a walk after long hot hours, I thought I was the only thing out of doors. Suddenly I stopped. Before me a rattlesnake lay fixed, its head not yet drawn back to strike but only turned a little to watch what I would do. Many snakes will run away at the sight of a man but this rattlesnake felt no necessity to get out of any-body's way. He held his ground in calm watch-fullness waiting for me to show my intentions. My first aim was to take no notice of him; I had never killed an animal if I was not forced to kill. But I remembered that there were children, dogs and horses at the farm as well as men and women with thin clothes on; my duty was to kill the snake. I went back to the farm and returned with a stick. The rattlesnake had not moved; he lay like a wire but more quickly than I could stride he shot into a bush and set up his rattling, warning me by this that I had made an unreasonable attack and attempted to take his life and that if I insisted he would have no choice but to take mine if he could. For a moment I listened to this terrifying sound and then I struck into the bush with my stick and, chop-ping about, dragged him out of the bush with his back broken. He struck once more at the stick but a moment later his neck was broken and he was soon dead although when I picked him up by the tail his mouth opened, proving that a dead snake may still bite. There was blood in his mouth and poison was dropping; it was not only a dis-gusting sight but a pitiful one too. I dropped the body into a green bush and, as I did so, I saw him in my imagination, crawling over the sands as he might have done if I had let him go.	['lay motionless but got ready to meet danger']

How does the colour green make the students feel?	Many scientists find that colours can change people's feelings. It's very interesting. Some colours can make people feel relaxed,and some colours can make people feel nervous. Now,this kind of knowledge is being used in many places. For example, school walls are always painted green because green makes students feel relaxed. It is also good for the students' eyes. Some books are also green or light blue for the same reason. Restaurant owners not only have to know how to make food,but also have to know how to make money. Here are some things they've learned from scientific studies. The colour red makes people hungry. Many fast food restaurants have red furniture or walls. Soft colours like pink and light blue make people feel relaxed,so they spend more time eating. Loud music may be nice at first,but it soon makes people want to leave. Hard seats also make customers want to eat quickly and leave. Many restaurants,especially fast food restaurants,use this knowledge to make customers eat faster.	['Relaxed.']

Jim called over his shoulder to the fire truck driver.Dave walked over and looked where Jim was pointing. ""How'd he get up there?"" Jim shrugged,similarly puzzled.""Do you suppose we could get the blanket and convince him to jump?"" Dave shrugged in response.""I don't see why not.""

As it got closer,the cat leaped down the pole swiftly onto the ground,and then got lost in the bushes.

Which of the following is NOT the reason why the author wrote this passage?	"Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time. Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice. A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood? ""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four."" And he named them. He said four names. And what did they talk about? ""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it."" It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on."

What is the passage mainly about?	You may know your mother, but how well do you really know Mothers' Day? Cards, flowers, sales, TV specials, and a day off for someone who really deserves it -- those are what probably come to mind for many people when they think of Mothers' Day. But there's more to the story. The earliest Mothers' Day celebrations were held during spring in ancient Greece. The celebrations honored Rhea, the mother of the gods. During the 1600's, England celebrated a day called Mothering Sunday. On this day even servants were given the day off to spend with their families. A mothering cake was even served with the family meal. In the US, Mothers' Day began in 1872 when Julia Ward Howe, who wrote the words to the famous song The Battle Hymn of the Republic, suggested it as a day devoted to peace. But it didn't really become popular until 1907 when Anna Jarvis started a campaign to honor mothers. She believed that mothers could help people get over the pain they experienced during the Civil War. The US isn't alone in devoting a day to mothers. Many other countries including Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Japan, and Belgium also honor their mothers in May. Other countries honor their mothers at different times of the year. Learning more about Mothers' Day and celebrating Mothers' Day are important, but probably not as important as understanding what your own mother, or grandmother, or aunt has really done for you. And that will certainly be appreciated more than one day in year.	"[""The history of Mothers' Day.""]"
Which of the following would the author agree with?	"Sarah came running in saying, ""Look what l found. "" Over the top of the paper I was reading I saw a long object that made me jump. It was a piece of snakeskin that had been shed by one of our garden snakes. 'Isn't it beautiful?"" said my wide-eyed 7~year-old daughter. I stared at the organic wrapper and thought to myself that it really was not that beautiful, but I did not want to disappoint Sarah. Everything children see for the first time is elementary to their sense of beauty and creativity. They see only merit and excellence in the world. ""Why does it do this?"" Sarah asked. I like to teach my children that there is something else going on besides what they see in front of them. ""Snakes shed their skin because they need to renew themselves,"" I explained. ""Why do they need to renew themselves?"" Sarah asked. ""We often need to shed our skins, those coatings that we cover ourselves with,"" I said to my now absorbed daughter. ""We outgrow some things and find other stuff unnecessary. This snake no longer needs this skin. It is probably too old, and the snake probably doesn't think it looks as smart in the skin as it once did. Like buying a new suit. "" Of course, I'm sure this explanation won't suit naturalists. But Sarah got the point. As we talked, I knew that she began to understand that renewal is part of progress; that we need to take a good look at ourselves, and rooms and schoolwork and creativity, and she began to see what we need to keep and what need to cast off. I was careful to point out that this is a natural process, not one to be forced. ""Snakes don't peel off their skin when they feel like it,"" I explained. ""lt happens as part of their growth. "" ""I see, Dad. "" said Sarah. She then jumped off my lap, grabbed the snakeskin, and ran off. I hoped she would remember this. Often, in order to find our real selves underneath the layers of community and culture we are cloaked in year after year, we need to start examining these layers. We need to gently peel some away, as we recognize them to be worthless, unnecessary, or flawed ; or at best, remember the things we discard to teach us how we can improve."

Why didn't the author like traveling between two cities at first?	When I was 4, my parents decided they could no longer live together. That same year, my mom moved to Los Angeles (L.A.) and a therapist was hired to decide where I would live. Playing with a dollhouse in her office, I showed her the mother's room on one side and the father's room on the other. When she asked me about the little boy's room, I told her the little boy didn't know where to sleep. The therapist finally decided I would stay with my dad during the school years and visit my mom on long holidays and for summers. I began flying between two cities and leading two different lives. I remember my last school day in Grade Six. My friends made plans to go to the beach together, but I couldn't join them because I had to fly to L.A. It wasn't that I didn't want to see my mom and stepdad; I just didn't want to leave my friends. It wasn't easy to put up a wall, and pretend I didn't hate saying goodbye to them. In the morning, my dad drove me to school with my packed bags, and after school, my friends went together, and I went to the airport. What has come of this in the end is that I'm always missing somebody. When I'm in northern California, I miss my mom and stepdad, while in L.A. I miss going out with my friends, my dad, and my little brother and sister. But after so many flights, I've learned that it's also fun traveling between two cities and experiencing different lives. Other children may not have the opportunity to experience so much.	['Because the traveling separated him from his friends.']
According to Werner, states help foster care kids with psychotropic drugs mainly because _ .	"Many children in foster care are being over medicated with antipsychotic drugs they may not really need, or the drugs are being given incorrectly, according to a government review obtained by CBS News. The report by an Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services looked at concerns surrounding the use of these powerful drugs in children on Medicaid. Many children on Medicaid are in the foster care system. ""Psychotropic drugs are being used in these children, and we don't really know what the side effects are in these young children,"" said CBS News reporter Anna Werner. ""There's not a lot of research because you can't really test these drugs on children."" More than half the time, the review found children on these powerful drugs were not being monitored adequately. A quarter of them were given the wrong amount of drugs. Many were given too many drugs or took them for too long. ""What the experts tell us is that not enough resources are needed to take care of these kids and give them the treatment that they need -- not drugs,"" Werner said. ""It takes a lot of time and a lot of people to do that, and that of course all costs money."" Therefore, states are choosing to just put kids on drugs instead. Dr. Fernando Siles, a child psychiatrist who treats children on Medicaid in Texas and has written thousands of prescriptions for such drugs, told Werner he doesn't have a lot of other options. He said children from troubled homes often have anger and aggression issues and he often prescribes drugs to ""contain"" their behavior so they won't get bounced from foster home to foster home. Werner's reporting also turned up the troubling case of a four-year-old boy who was put on four different psychiatric medications in the foster care system. When his grandmother gained custody a year later, she said the boy seemed like a completely different child since he has taken all the drugs. But he still has frightening dreams at the age of 10. Werner reports a number of states, including Texas, have taken steps to reduce the use of these drugs in foster children. But experts say more progress is needed, along with greater oversight of the system."	['these drugs cost less money than other treatments']

Why do many American girls like to tell stories using the camera?	"Now that newsrooms are becoming less popular in the US,young people have begun to tell their own stories. GlobalGirl Media,a nonprofit organization that teaches teenage girls digital storytelling skills,was started by award-winning filmmakers Amie Williams and Meena Nanji in Los Angeles in 2010. ""By giving girls a voice,you introduce a different story,and change the existing one,""said Danny Glover,a member of the GlobalGirl Media advisory board. ""When the camera's in my hands,I feel like I can't lose,""Said Cheyenne Grisez,14.""It makes me happy and I feel like I can do anything."" On the final day of the summer academy in California,Williams worked with Grisez and Camila Prado,15,on a short film about Prado's fight against an eating disorder.In the film,Prado bravely interviewed her parents and sister about how she was able to beat her depression and eating disorder.This film and others the girls had made were shown to parents and friends on the last day of the academy,celebrating their hard work. ""It's their story,and nobody knows how to tell it better than they do,""Williams said. ""These girls are from really difficult backgrounds.They feel trapped sometimes.They feel alone.""Williams said.""The camera gives them a way to look at their world in a different way and get out of that feeling.'' Girls in the program practice their skills and build confidence by going out in the community and interviewing people for the short films.Many of them had no experience,but found they had good storytelling skills. ""I work with these girls.Every day I leave inspired and completely grateful,because I know that.due to the work we're doing with them,things will be better,""said GlobalGirl Media summer academy project director Heather Faison."

What causes Fishlock to think that elephants are special?	"An anxious mother watched as rescuers freed her baby from a muddy well. After being pulled from the well,the baby joyfully ran to its mom as the rescuers took a break. It was a difficult and potentially dangerous rescue: the baby was an 8-month-old elephant, and at first its mother thought the humans were trying to harm it. The baby elephant fell into the five-foot-deep well near Kenya's Amboseli National Park. Local people had dug the well for water. It took 30 minutes to remove the trapped elephant. While Vicki Fishlock of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants made a loud shout to frighten the mother away, two men struggled to get a rope around the baby elephant. Once the rope was in place, Fishlock used her jeep to pull the baby out. Fishlock recognized Zombe, the mother of the trapped baby elephant,from a mark on her ear. She believes that in the end Zombe realized the humans were trying to help. ""Rescues where the elephant's family members are around are always stressful, and I'm always happy when everyone is safe,"" Fishlock said.""The reunions always bring tears to my eyes. The depth of their love for each other is one of the things that make elephants so unusual."" The very next day, another baby elephant fell into the same well. The 3-month-old's family had been driven away from the area by local people. Once it had been rescued, the Amboseli Trust had to send it to an elephant orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya's capital city. The rescues showed the _ of elephants across Africa. Elephants are fighting to survive, as conflicts between the animals and humans are increasing. Thousands of elephants are also being killed for their tusks. The tusks are sold in Asia, where ivory trinkets are in high demand. The Amboseli Trust has been studying elephants and trying to help them since 1972. Fishlock said, ""We hope this rescue persuades people that elephants are special and deserve to be protected and treasured."""	['The deep love between them.']
What has earned Mitchell appearances in many famous publications?

Mitchell bought himself a home in Colorado,a plane and a bar.Later he teamed upwith two friends and co-founded a wood burning stove company that grew to be the second largest private employer in his state.Six months later he was piloting the plane.Then four years after the motorcycle accident,the plane Mitchell was piloting crashed back onto the runway during takeoff, permanently paralyzing(...)him from the waist down.

What did the writer think of having good speech before the classes?	"My teachers suggested that I see a speech specialist in school. I never really gave much thought to my speech. If other people understood what I was saying, then that was good enough. I didn't mind repeating myself many times. Before testing me, the speech specialist asked me what I thought of having good speech. I told her I thought it was not important. ""Well, when you are in an interview for a job, and they don't know what you are saying, what are they going to say to you? Nice meeting you, bye,"" she said. Maybe good speech was important. I took part in 20-minute classes each week with the specialist. After she tested me, she told me that I spoke too fast, and didn't give enough eye contact . I learned that when I made eye contact with someone, it meant that I was talking to that person, and I could also see what he or she thought about what I was saying. When my first speech class started, I found that I had been speaking too fast to be understood. Every time I spoke too fast, the specialist stopped me and told me to start again. At first, I got stopped after almost every other sentence. After a while, I felt my speech slow down. I wasn't sure if people could understand me better, but my friends stopped asking me to repeat myself. Speech is an important skill to have. If you do have good speech, that's a good thing, but if you don't have it, it is never too late to improve."	['It was nothing important.']
People went to Hollywood to make films because _ .	At the beginning of the 20th century there was a big farm called Hollywood Ranch. It was near Los Angeles in California. A few years later Hollywood was one of the famous places in the world. From the 1910s to the 1950s Hollywood was the film center of the world. Every family knew the names of its film stars--Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman and hundreds more. The reason why people went to Hollywood to make films was the sun. At first,people made films in New York on the east coast of the United States. But then they heard about Los Angeles where there are 350 days of sun every year. As they made all the films by sunlight,the west coast was a much better place to make films. Also near Hollywood you can find mountains,sea and desert. They did not have to travel far to make any kind of film. When TV became popular, Hollywood started making films for television. Then in the 1970s they discovered people still went to the cinema to see big expensive films. After about thirty years they are still making films in Hollywood and people watch them all over the world.	['there was a lot of sunlight']
The best title of the passage is _ .	What are you going to do if you are in a burning house? How will you escape? Do you know how to save yourself? Please read the following passage. Escaping a fire is a serious matter.Knowing what to do during a fire can save your life.It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone in the family,such as stairways and fire escapes,but not lifts. From the lower floors of the buildings,escaping through windows is possible,learn the best way of leaving by windows with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground.An average person,hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground.It is about the height of an average man.Of course,it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help.Be sure to keep the door closed.Or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room.Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may leaked into the room. On a second or third floor,the best windows for escaping are those that open onto a roof.From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely.Dropping onto cement might end in injury.Bushes and grass can help to break a fall.

What can we learn about Amelia Atwater - Rhodes?	"It was on her 14th birthday that her first book ,In the Forest of the Night, was accepted for publication. It was a huge success gaining the attention of millions of young readers. At 16, her second novel,Demon in My View, also reached the bookstores. Several books later, the teenage author still works away in her room, surrounded by shelves full of dark tales about vampires and witches. Amelia Atwater - Rhodes is widely seen as America's finest teen writer and was named one of Teen People's ""20 Teens Who Will Change the World."" Born in 1984, she began making up stories when she was about three years old. ""I never stopped and said, 'I want to write',"" Amelia remembers. ""I loved stories and created stories before I was old enough to know how to write them down."" In her family, reading was basic and fun. ""My parents encouraged me to read -- and to read anything I wanted, so long as I was reading,"" she said. ""They never restricted what I read. Later, when I started writing, they never criticized what I did or said I was 'too young'. They never said it was impossible for me to achieve what I have."" In her short but successful career, Amelia has tried different styles. But vampires were the first characters to really come alive in her work. From _ she has developed a whole world, one which she always enjoys learning more about. As a published teen writer, Amelia's advice to other teens who dream of being authors is: just do it! ""I believe anything is possible. Don't give up your dreams just because you fear failure. Getting a book published is difficult, but if I can do it, others can too.

Mr. Perkin can't find his car because _ .	Mr. Perkin stands at the bus stop and watches the cars go by. Many of the cars are Beta 400s, and most of them are yellow. Mr. Perkin likes to do what other people do. So the following week he buys a new yellow Beta 400s. He likes it very much and doesn't like the old red one any more. This morning Mr. Perkin parks his car in a big park at half past eight near his office. But when he comes out of his office at five o'clock, there're so many yellow Beta 400s in the park. Mr. Perkin can't find out which car is his because he forgets its number and leaves his licence at home. He tries his key in some of the cars and people looks at him. He has to give up. Poor Mr. Perkin can do nothing. He waits nearly two hours until his car is the only yellow Beta 400s left in the park.	"[""he can't remember the car's number""]"

When did the author have the idea to visit Beijing hutong?	"I first visited hutong as part of a tourist group several years ago. We rode on a trishaw with a guide explaining the history, architecture and lifestyle of the local inhabitants. Having visited the ""must-sees"" of Beijing, like the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, the Drum Tower and the Summer Palace, going into the hutong home of some famous ancient families gave the ""Beijing experience"" a human element. My curiosity has sharpened over the years from reading about them at every opportunity. During the preparation for the Olympics, I was eager to learn that some siheyuan courtyards in hutong were turned into accommodations for visitors. I wished to stay in one someday. Preparing for a recent trip to the capital, I eagerly sought one out. On my limited teacher's salary, I settled on an affordable option, though I looked longingly at the more courtyard accommodations. As usual, by not being able to go upmarket, I ended up having something closer to a true experience. A real family still lives in the courtyard, which is closer to the original. The rooms all opened into the central courtyard. Flowers were blooming, beans and peas were climbing up the bamboo fence, and the cat was napping in the sun. Every day after exploring the city, I'd hurry back to the hutong, take a quick shower and join the cat - snoozing in a bamboo-made chair with a book ready nearby. As the other guests came back we'd greet one another. There was a mother and young daughter from France, a guy from Canada, a mother and teenage daughter from the Netherlands, a teacher from England and several guests from various parts of China. Coming and going through the narrow alleys of the hutong, the residents would smile and give cheery ""ni hao"" (hello). Laughing children were playing under the watchful eyes of the neighbors. I felt right at home in this friendly neighborhood."	"[""the author doesn't mention it specifically""]"
What do the Italian flag and a Pizza Margherita have in common?	"So you thought the hamburger was the world's most popular fast food? After all, McDonald's Golden Arches span the globe . But no, there is another truly universal fast food, the ultimate fast food. It's easy to make, easy to serve, much more varied than the hamburger, can be eaten with the hands and it's delivered to your front door or served in fancy restaurants. It's been one of America's favourite foods for over 50 years. It is, of course, the pizza. It's kind of silly to talk about the moment when pizza was ""invented"". It changed over the years, but one thing's for certain--it's been around for a very long time. The idea of using pieces of flat, round bread as plates came from the Greeks. They called them ""plakuntos"" and ate them with various simple toppings such as oil, garlic , onions and herbs. The Romans enjoyed eating something similar and called it ""picea"". By about 1000 AD in the city of Naples, ""picea"" had become ""pizza"" and people were experimenting with more toppings: cheese, ham, anchovies and finally the tomato, brought to Italy from Mexico and Peru in the sixteenth century. Naples became the pizza capital of the world. In 1889, King UmbertoIand Queen Margherita heard about pizza and asked to try it. They invited pizza maker, Raffele Esposito, to make it for them. He decided to make the pizza like the Italian flag, so he used red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese and green basil leaves. The Queen loved it and the new pizza was named ""Pizza Margherita"" in her honour. Pizza went to America with the Italians at the end of the nineteenth century. The first pizzeria in the United States was opened in 1905 at 53 Spring Street, New York City, by Gennaro Lombardi. But the popularity of pizza really exploded when American soldiers returned from Italy after World WarII and raved about ""that great Italian dish"". Americans are now the greatest producers and consumers of pizza in the world."	['They have the same colours.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"I was born an albino in Pennsylvania in 1945.No one in my family had ever known what an albino was and what it meant to be an albino. My family and friends treated me as everybody else.That was just about the best thing they could have done.It helped me believe in myself, so when troubles came along, I could deal with them. Like most albinos, I had the terrible eyesight, but the fact that I could hardly see didn't bother me that much .Kids would make fun of me, calling me""Whitey"". People looked at me when I held the books right at the tip of my nose so that I could see it well enough.Even when I was eight, movie-theater workers started asking me to pay full prices because I""looked older"".The worst thing for me was that because my eyesight was so bad, I couldn't play sports very well.I didn't give up trying, though.And I studied harder.Finally, I got better at school and loved it.When I got to university, I was double majoring , going to summer school and busying myself with every activity I could find.I had learned to be proud of being an albino.I did my best to make""albino""a good word.And I decided to make my living with my eyes--and in sports. I couldn't see very well to play sports, but with a good education and a drive to do it, I could make a living in the area I loved.I've done it now for more than thirty years in video, and now in cyberspace .People make jokes about how I'm the only""blind editor""they know, but the jokes are of goodwill and some of them are signs of respect .

Why is Mona Island different from most places? Because _	Are you looking for a fun vacation spot? Do you like to sleep in a hotel, go shopping, and eat fancy meals? If so, Mona Island might Not be the place for you! That's because Mona Island has no hotels, no museums, no shops, and no restaurants. None at all! But if you like nature , Mona Island is an amazing place to take a vacation. Some of the animals living there are not found anywhere else in the world. There are beautiful beaches and caves to explore. The sea around the island has colorful fish. There are many things that make Mona Island an unusual place. Mona Island is very small, On a map it looks like a tiny green lima bean floating in the big blue ocean. the only way to get there is by taking a long boat ride from the island of Puerto Rico. The government of Puerto Rico takes care of the island and has made it a natural reserve. That means the island's animals and plants are protected from being harmed by people. Mona Island is different from most places because people are not allowed to live there. Only a few park rangers are able to stay. The park ranger's job is to keep Mona Island safe and beautiful. They insist that rules be followed. One rule is that only 100 people at a time can visit the island. That way, the park rangers can make sure the land and animals remain safe. B.

Which statement most closely parallels the author's conclusion about knowledge of the past?	"During my early twenties, to make my parents stop feeling angry, and simply to escape, I decided to live in my birthplace for a period of time, something I'd sworn I would never do. My parents were thrilled. They prayed that I'd come back triumphantly with a picture-perfect bridegroom. That was the furthest thing from my mind as I packed my faded jeans, tank tops, boots, and a photo of my freckle-faced then-boyfriend who was of Scottish descent. The moment I landed in Seoul, I was aware of how much I felt like a misfit. All my life I had tried to blend into the dominant culture and couldn't. And finally, when I was in a place where everyone looked like me, I still stood out. I took it for granted that I'd feel a sense of freedom. I thought I'd blend into the landscape. This was not the case. People stared at me with curious eyes. I became conscious of my American-girl swaggering body movements and inappropriate dress. Collecting my courage, I traveled to the demilitarized zone on my own. I touched the high barbed-wire fence that stretched across the belly of the peninsula , dividing Korea in half. I visited thousand-year-old temples and magnificent palace gates that had survived modernization and centuries of battle. I met with distant cousins who welcomed me with outstretched arms into their homes and related heroic tales about my mother and Halmoni (Grandmother) during the war. How Halmoni had led her young children out of north to the United Nation-backed south. How my mother, at the age of thirteen, saved the life of her baby sister. I listened with such an overwhelming thirst that when I returned to the States a year and a half later, I began to ask my parents and Halmoni (who had immigrated to the States some time after we did) all about the past. The past was no longer a time gone by, a dead weight. I now saw that it held ancient treasures. And the more I dug and discovered, the more I felt myself being steered toward a future I had never imagined for myself. I began to write. I didn't even know I could write. My family helped me knit stories into a book using Halmoni's voice. As her powerful words moved through me I was able to reflect and meditate on the ridiculous life I had fashioned for myself. I could feel my sense of self rising. This sparked a newfound awareness and excitement. I became a spokeswoman on Korean culture, traveling to various college campuses across the country. ""Be proud. Embrace your heritage."" I said to young Korean American students wearing extra-large, trendy sportswear. But the whole time I was lecturing, I had very little understanding of what that self-concept meant. I was merely talking the talk. I hadn't yet fully embraced my own identity."

"The artist created the masterpiece ""The Praying Hands"""	"Born into a poor family,two of the Durers' children still had a dream for art,but they knew their father could not afford to send either of them to the academy . After discussions,the two boys finally agreed to toss a coin.The loser would go to the nearby mines and support his brother while he attended the academy.Then,when the winner completed his studies,he would support the other brother,either with sales of his art work or,if necessary,by working in the mines.So they tossed a coin.Albrecht Durer won the toss and went to Nuremberg.Albert went to the dangerous mines and financed his brother,whose work at the academy was almost an immediate success,and by graduation,he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his works. When the Durer family held a dinner to celebrate Albrecht's homecoming, Albrecht drank a toast to his brother,""Now,Albert,it is your turn to go to Nuremberg and follow your dream,and I will take care of you."" Albert wiped the tears from his cheeks,glanced at the faces he loved,and said softly,""No,brother.It is too late for me.Look....look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been broken at least once,and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast,much 1ess make lines on canvas with a pen or a brush.No,brother ...for me it is too 1ate.""

The reason why journalists are not eager to accept computer newspapers is that _ .	Sometimes in the next century, the familiar early-newspaper on the front porch will disappear. And instead of reading your newspaper, it will read to you. You'll get up and turn on the computer newspaper just like switching on the TV. An electronic voice will distribute stories about the latest events, guided by a program that selects the type of news you want. You'll even get to choose the kind of voice you want to hear. Want more information on the brief story? A simple touch makes the entire text appear. Save it in your own personal computer if you like. These are among the predictions from communication experts working on the newspaper of the future. Pictured as part of broader home based media and entertainment systems, computer newspapers would unite print and broadcast reporting, offering news and analysis with video images of news events. Most of the technology is available now, but convincing more people that they don't need paper to read a newspaper is the next step. But resistance to computer newspapers may be stronger from within journalism. Since it is such a cultural change, it may be that the present generation of journalists and publishers will have to die off before the next generation realize that the newspaper industry is no longer a newspaper industry. Technology is making the end of traditional newspapers unavoidable. Despite technological advances, it could take decades to replace news-print with computer screens. It might take 30 to 40 years to complete the changeover because people need to buy computers and because newspapers have established financial interests in the paper industry.

Fred Laster and Jasper Watts bought into the Garden Burgers franchise only 3 years and a few months ago.They have used the combination of a good restaurant location and a series of promotional events to make Garden Burgers one of the most visited restaurants in Truman.However, they are quick to add that these are not the main reasons the store has done so well.""We found a franchise with a solid image and great franchise - wide marketing, "" Watts said in a phone interview. Laster and Watts expect this year to be just as productive as last year.After 4 months, they are on pace to exceed last year' s sales by more than $70,000.Each year the head office awards the owners of the store achieving the highest sales with a weekend stay at the best hotel in Kansas City and tickets to a Kansas City Chiefs football game.However, due to the extremely good sales performance of the store in Truman, the head office decided to change the tradition.Laster and Watts said their staff, which consists of only 5 university students, would be joining them in Kansas city as well.

The author's experience mainly shows that _ .	Stubbornness(,) can push a business to hold on but can also kill your business if it keeps stopping you. Because I'm stubborn. I chased my dream of creating a pet-food company that sells what it claims to sell and not some unidentifiable substance in a dressed-up bag. Originally we packed our foods in transparent bags, which became our guiding philosophy. To start the company in 2003, I visited every pet-food store in Manhattan and some outside the city. By 2006 Stella&Chewy's was sold in 250 stores, mostly in New York City. In 2007 I moved the company to Wisconsin, with our earnings reaching almost $500,000 that year.But getting my product into stores was just the beginning. We were competing against much bigger pet-food companies whose monthly marketing budgets were more than our yearly sales. So we invested in advertisements and a website and even stood on sidewalks giving our samples. With more customers came more feedback , much of which I ignored, I was also receiving complaints about ice crystals on the food, which form when the air temperature changes during transport. For this reason, most frozen foods are packaged in opaque bags or boxes. Studies have proved that ice crystals have little effect on either the quality or the taste of the food. So I ignored the complaints. After all, we were better than our competitors that wouldn't even show their products. We didn't hide anything. In 2007 our sales kept growing, but not as fast as those of our competitors. We were told that new consumers were choosing products packaged in opaque bags. When I visited the stores and forced myself to consider my products objectively, I had to degree: The ice crystals reduced the look I wanted. The food looked as if a snowstorm had hit the inside of the bag. We switched to opaque bags and tried to make ice crystals smaller. Customers responded: In 2009 Stella$Chewy's was sold in 2,500 stores across the country.	['stubbornness can make people succeed or fail']
Queen Victoria's story wants to tell us that _ .	"You cannot find a better way to enjoy Scottish traditions than going fishing and tasting a little bit of whisky at a quiet place like the Inverlochy Castle. When Queen Victoria visited the castle in 1873, she wrote in her diary, ""I never saw a lovelier spot ,"" And she didn't even go fishing. Scotland is not easily defined. In certain moments, this quiet land of lakes and grasses and mountains changes before your very eyes. When evening gently sweeps the hillside into orange light ,the rivers, teeming with fish, can turn into streams of gold . As you settle down with just a fishing pole and a basket on the bank of River Orchy, near the Inverlochy castle , any frustration will float away as gently as the circling water. It's just you and purple , pink ,white flowers, seeking a perfect harmony . If you are a new comer to fishing, learning the basics from a fishing guide may leave you with a lifetime's fun. For many, fishing is more than a sport, it is an art. Scotland offers interesting place where you can rest after a long day's fishing. Set against a wild mountain and hidden behind woodland , the beautiful Inverlochy Castle Hotel below the Nevis is a perfect place to see the beauty of Scotland's mountains . Ben Nevis is the highest of all British mountains , and reaching its 1342-metre top is a challenge . But it's not just what goes up that matters; what comes down is unique . More than 900 metres high, on the mountain's north face, lies an all-important source of pure water. Its name comes form the Gaelic language ""usqueb"" or ""water of life"", and it is the single most important ingredient in Scotland's best-known drink: whisky."

_ is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.	We can not live a modern life without traveling.The fastest way of traveling is by air.With a plane people can travel in one day to places which it took a month or more to get to a hundred years ago. Traveling by train is slower than by plane, but people can see the country when they are traveling through.Modern trains have comfortable seats and dinning-cars.They make even the longest journey enjoyable. Some people prefer to travel by sea when possible.There are large luxury liners or river boats.They are not as fast as trains or planes, but traveling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday. Many people like to travel by car.They can make their own timetable.They can travel hundreds of miles or only fifty miles a day, just as their wish.They can stop wherever they want to see something interesting or to enjoy a good meal at a good restaurant, or to spend the night at a hotel.That is why people choose traveling by car for pleasant trips, while they usually take trains or planes for business.

"In the advertisement, ""only X shopping days to Christmas"", ""X"" can be _ ."	"In England, Christmas is the most important holiday in the year. Two important things, apart from its religious significance, help to set this holiday apart from all others: the custom of giving presents and the habit of spending it with the family. In the present highly commercialized age we are reminded of Christmas many weeks before the event. In the shops the special Christmas displays appear and outside them the special Christmas decorations. In the shopping centers of very large towns decorations are put up in the streets. In London thousands of people crowded into the centre of the town to see the decorations. The advertisements in all the newspapers remind us every day that there are ""Only X more shopping days to Christmas"". The Post Office vans are covered with brightly color1ed pictures advising us to ""Post Early for Christmas"", for hundred of millions of Christmas cards and millions of parcels are sent every year. Everywhere one turns, one is made aware that Christmas, which comes ""but once a year"", is coming once again. Many people feel sorrow about what they consider the over-commercialization of a sacred holiday, but, underneath all the business activities, a great deal of Christmas spirit is to be found. The custom of giving presents to one's family and friends is a very pleasant one so long as one remembers that it is the spirit behind the present which matters most and not the present itself. And how good it is at Christmas to return to the family home and meet parents, grandparents and as many aunts, uncles and cousins as can be expected to meet. Without the modern means of transport, however, many families would have the Christmas reunion."	['a small number']
A decimum was_.	"It is not often realized that women held a high place in southern European societies in the 10 th and 11 th centuries. As wife, the woman was protected by the setting up of a dowry or decimum. Admittedly, the purpose of this was to protect her against the risk of desertion ,but in reality its function in the social and family life of the time was much more important. The decimum was the wife's right to receive a tenth of all her husband's property. The wife had the right to withhold consent, in all transactions the husband would make, And more than just a right: the documents showed that she enjoyed a real power of decision, equal to that of her husband. In no case did the documents indicate any degree of difference in the legal status of husband and wife. The wife shared in the management of her husband's personal property, but the opposite was not always true. Women seemed perfectly prepared to defend their own inheritance(,)against husbands who tried to exceed their rights, and on occasion they showed a fine fighting spirit. A case in point is that of Maria, Vivas, a Catalan woman of Barcelona. Having agreed with her husband Miro to sell a field she had inherited, for the needs of the household, she insisted on compensation. None being offered, she succeeded in dragging her husband to the scribe to have a contract duly drawn up assigning her a piece of land from Miro's personal inheritance. The unfortunate husband was obliged to agree, as the contract says, ""for the sake of peace."" Either through the dowry or through being hot-tempered, the Catalan wife knew how to win herself, within the context of the family, a powerful economic position."

Why does the author want to go to Italy again?	"One summer my friend and I decided to go to Italy for a holiday and we decided to travel there without going through a travel agency. You know, you would be submerged in crowds of tourists and lose lots of opportunities to get familiar with the country more closely. We started to think over our trip and managed to come up with a free tour of Italy. The trip was not very long but it was still very impressive. We look forward to going there again! Of course, we spent lots of time arranging the trip, but it was well worth it! Of course I was afraid that something would go wrong and I was especially anxious about my visa, but everything went quite smoothly in the end. ks5u The most difficult part was getting a visa without an invitation. In the Italian consulate , one must hand in some official paper proving that one has a hotel booked for oneself in order to get the visa. Then we had to solve the ticket problem. Airlines often sell cheap tickets and we bought ours far in advance. The next step was to book a hotel. We finally booked a hotel about thirty km away from the heart of Rome and it was the perfect choice for our trip. Every day we took a train that carried us to the heart of Rome. Our big house, which was surrounded by the forest, was a rare girl for the fresh air and silence, beautiful views, hospitable hosts, comfortable living conditions delighted us to no end. Besides this, we were very lucky that our mistress was Russian. She gave us a lot of advice that was of great use. She told us what transport to choose and where the best places to go. Don't be afraid to arrange your trip by yourself. It's not difficult! The only thing I'll say right now is that we really enjoyed traveling by ourselves. We walked with a map and a guide-book to wherever we wanted and we even met some of our fellow countrymen on the way just two or three times. So, if you're also planning a ""single"" trip, don't forget to take a Russian-Italian phrasebook as people in Italy prefer to speak in their native tongue."	['He had a great time there.']

According to the passage,which is Not true?	Hundreds of people did not get their train tickets through the online train ticketing service after paying the money. The China Railway Customer Service Center said that it would try to solve the problem and return the money in 15 working days. The service center said changes would be made to the online booking system which limited each purchase which is finished in 30 minutes. Many people said that they failed to book tickets because of the time limit in purchase. People who paid without getting their tickets have formed groups on QQ. As many as 400 people had joined the QQ group by Thursday and the group continues to grow. The ticket buyers said their money had been returned through online banks but they didn't get confirmation from the online booking system. They are afraid that they will not be able to get refunds because they don't have the order number given to those who have succeeded in booking. People also said they were unable to inquire through the booking hotline 12306, because it is almost always busy. The China Railway Customer Service Center Website suggested that the online banks didn't return the payment information to the online booking system because of network problems. The online railway booking service was made by the Ministry of Railways on Dec. 21, in order that people can easily buy train tickets during the Spring Festival.

Which of the following shows the probable parts of the four shows?	"Different colours can affect us in many different ways, according to Verity Allen. In her new series ' Colour me Healthy', Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make. They can even change our emotions and influence how healthy we are. ""Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things ?"" says Verity. "" Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red. It's never green. For some reason we consider green products as being a bit unacceptable. It's the same for businesses. We respect a company writing its name in blue or black, but we don't respect one that uses pink or orange. People designing new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy."" During the four-part series, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each programme. She meets people who work in all aspects of the colour industry, from people designing food packets , to people naming the colours of lipsticks . Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to support their ideas, such as the American "" Colour Doctor"" who believes that serious diseases can be treated by the use of coloured lights. However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results. In a word, it's an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new. But because Verity goes out of her way to be polite to everyone she meets on the series, it's up to the viewers to make their own decisions about how much they should believe."

The three movies are from _ .	"This year's lunar New Year holiday season is likely to see the fierce competitions at the country's box office among three movies that come from reality TV programs instead of legends, novels and original stories. The Chinese movies Running Man, Where are We Going, Dad? II and Emperor's Holidays are all based on South Korean TV shows. Where are We Going, Dad? hit an amazing box-office run of 700 million yuan in 2014, and it was one of the most popular Chinese-language movies last year. And this year's Where are We Going, Dad? II shows four famous fathers trying to ""survive"" with their children on an island of the Republic of Fiji . Running Man was also one of the most well-known shows from last October to this January. It has got 227 million yuan at the box office in the first three days after it was on in the cinema. It's reported that people laughed 86 times while watching the 88-minute movie. Emperor's Holidays is directed by Wang Yuelun, who was a celebrity father in the fatherhood series' first season. The movie was screened in Chinese theaters on Feb 19, the same day as Dad II and also the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year. For these kinds of movies, different people have different opinions. Some may think it is not worth spending money watching them, because the producers just want to make money. However, others may think whatever the producers' aim is, these movies can inspire people to live more healthily and make them keep laughing and happy. So they choose to enjoy them in the cinema."

Which of the following is NOT true?	Dear Sir or Madam. Last Thursday. I traveled on the 8:00 a.m. train from Glasgow to London King's Cross and I was quite angry with the service of your company. The train didn't come on time and it was forty minutes late when it left Glasgow. A man at the station said sorry to us, but he didn't give us any reasons for the delay . We then had further delays on the way and had to wait another thirty minutes. As a result, I missed my plane from London to Frankfurt and had to wait for several hours. What's more, the service on the train was also very poor. The trip took more than five hours. Unluckily. we could buy nothing but some soft drinks on the train. Worst of all, something was wrong with the air conditioning and it got hotter and hotter in the train. Before we reached King's Cross, the temperature was over 40degC. Because of your poor service. I feel you should pay me compensation . I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully, David Roberson	['David was very pleased with the trip.']

Why does Copenhagen plan to build the first bike highway?	"Considered one of Europe's two ""bicycle capitals"" along with Amsterdam, Copenhagen counts more bicycles than people and cycling is so popular that its numerous bike paths can become crowded. Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade road used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. ""You have to elbow your way in to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,"" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell. The creation of bike highways ""comes right on time"", says Danish Cyclist Federation Spokesman Frits Bredal. ""Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,"" he says. ""If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycles have supposed that role today,"" Bredal says. ""It's a _ of transportation used by all social classes, even politicians ride bikes,"" he says. It is on crowded Noerrebrogade--the busiest bicycle street in Europe, according to the cyclist association--that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly roads. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four metres on either side of the road, which itself will be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade ""Europe's great cycling street"", says Andreas Roehl, Copenhagen government's bicycle program manager who is also known as ""Mr. Bike"". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner-city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to hike the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 37 percent it is today to 50 percent by 2015."

Where can we probably see this passage?	"Most Chinese people share a few common surnames, like Zhang, Wang, Li, Liu and Chen. The Chinese expression for ""ordinary people"" literally means ""the old one hundred surnames"". But Cheng Yinglian, a retired worker living in Changsha, the capital of Hunan, said his interest in rare surnames was piqued after reading a newspaper many years ago and discovering a person with the surname Gui, which literally means ""ghost"", the report said. Since then, he has scoured newspapers, books and other publications to find similar rare surnames, coming up with about 2,000 to date. Those he has found include Ling (zero), Cu (vinegar), Miao (second) and Yi (one). Cheng said in order to collect and find out the origins of the strange surnames, he bought many ancient works and dictionaries for study. This February, he also published a book based on his surname collection. ""I may apply for the Guinness (Book of World Records),"" said Cheng. He said most of the surnames he collected are not included in the Hundred Surnames, a classic Chinese text composed of common surnames in ancient China. According to the latest statistics available from the Ministry of Public Security in 2007, nearly 93 million people in China are surnamed ""Wang"", taking the largest proportion among all surnames. And people with the top 100 common surnames in China take up 84.77 percent of the whole population. Chinese people attach great significance to people's names and many parents go out of their way to give their children _ names that suggest they will grow up to be healthy, strong and rich. ,."

What do we know about John?	"When John was growing up, other kids felt sorry for him. His parents always had him weeding the garden, carrying out the garbage and delivering newspapers. But when John reached adulthood, he was better off than his childhood playmates. He had more job satisfaction, a better marriage and was healthier. Most of all, he was happier. Far happier. These are the findings of a 40-year study that followed the lives of 456 teenage boys from Boston. The study showed that those who had worked as boys enjoyed happier and more productive lives than those who had not. ""Boys who worked in the home or community gained competence and came to feel they were worthwhile members of society,"" said George Vaillant, the psychologist who made the discovery. ""And because they felt good about themselves, others felt good about them."" Vaillant's study followed these males in great detail. Interviews were repeated at ages 25, 31 and 47. Under Vaillant, the researchers compared the men's mental-health scores with their boyhood-activity scores with their boyhood-activity scores. Points were awarded for part-time jobs, housework, effort in school, and ability to deal with problems. The link between what the men had done as boys and how they turned out as adults was surprisingly _ . Those who had done the most boyhood activities were twice as likely to have warm relations with a wide variety of people, five times as likely to be well paid and 16 times less likely to have been unemployed. The researchers also found that IQ and family social and economic class made no real difference in how the boys turned out. Working----at any age----is important. Childhood activities help a child develop responsibility, independence, confidence and competence---the underpinnings of emotional health. They also help him understand that people must cooperate and work toward common goals. The most competent adults are those who know how to do this. Yet work isn't everything. As Tolstoy once said, ""One can live magnificently in this world if one knows how to work and how to love, to work for the person one loves and to love one's work."""

Which is the best title? _ .	People usually talk about two groups of colours: warm colours and cool colours. Scientists think that there are also two groups of people: people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active . People think that red example is exciting sociable people, those who like to be with others like red. The cool colours are green, blue and purple. These colours, unlike warm colours, are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting but one scientist says that time seems to pass more slow in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggested that a warm colour such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or a restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating don't want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices of factories as the people who work there want time to pass quickly. Scientists don't know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that warm colours remind people of warm days and cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is low during winter, the sunlight appears quite blue. Because the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

According to the text, Jones finds that _ .	"Dogs may not know exactly what you are doing especially when you're trying to figure out a square root or diagram a sentence. But according to a new study, dogs can understand what we're thinking and feeling by reading our facial expressions and body language and following our eyes. Researchers studied 29 dogs. The dogs were shown a movie where a woman looked directly at them and said ""Hi dog!"" Then, the woman looked at a flowerpot sitting next to her. The researchers found that when the woman looked at and spoke directly to a dog, the dog usually followed her eyes to the flowerpot. It proved that the dogs knew that the woman was thinking about the flowerpot. ""By following the eye movements of dogs, we were able to get a first-hand look at how their minds are actually working,"" said Jozsef, the senior researcher. Later in the movie, the woman said ""Hi dogs"" in a low voice and didn't look at the dog before looking at the flowerpot. In that situation, the dogs didn't seem to understand what the woman was thinking. There was no eye contact, and the woman didn't appear to speak to the dogs directly. That comes as no surprise to dog trainer Jones. ""Dogs normally speak through nonverbal signals. It's more natural to them,"" she said. ""If you've ever watched dogs at a dog park, you've seen it. Within 30 seconds they enter the park, much information has passed between the new dog and the ones already in the park. They're exchanging looks, observing eyes and body posture. On the other hand, when you speak to a dog, they are learning a foreign language."" Picking up your nonverbal signals seems more natural. So, if you were hoping that all this means your dog could help you solve your math problems, you're probably out of luck. But he or she might a lot more what you're thinking than you previously thought."	['dogs speak through eyes and body language']
Mama bought papa a straw hat because _ .	"Papa's Straw Hat Papa was a ranger. He worked with horses. He always wore clean clothes with a hat even when he worked. His hat was always the same kind of a cowboy hat- large black hat of heavy wool. He wore his hat full and high. I think he wanted to look taller than he really was. Mama was proud of the way he looked when he wore his hat and his best clothes. But in some way she got the idea that papa would lose his hair if he kept wearing a heavy wool cowboy hat in the hot weather. She began to talk about his hats. ""Papa,"" she said one day, ""why don't you get a nice cool straw hat? That heavy wool cowboy hat may cause losing hair!"" Papa laughed at her and explained that the horses wouldn't recognize him if he changed the hat. But she didn't believe him. Mama talked and talked about the hat all summer long. At last papa answered, a little angry, ""It would not the cowboy hat but a wife's talking about the hat that makes me lose my hair."" Mama had a very serious look on her face. She went straight out and later came home with a straw hat. It was a bad year for ranger and we didn't have much money. She thought that if she spent the money for a straw hat, papa would wear it. When papa saw the hat, his face got red. Without a word, he pulled the straw hat down over his head until it hid his eyes and went on to train the horses. He was a good ranger and gentle to his horses. But as papa got close to the horses this time, they jumped high into the air, raising their front feet. All of them ran around in the rounded field and then raced toward the barn. Papa began to shout ""Woo boys. Steady boys, steady."" But there was nothing equal to. Papa walked back straight to the stove in the kitchen, pushed the straw hat deep down into the fire then turned to mama, in a way that even frightened me. ""Now listen to me, mama. Understand this I will never wear a straw hat or any other kind of hat my horses do not like."" Then he put on his wool cowboy hat and walked out of the house. I never heard mama talk any more about hats. Perhaps, that is why when papa died many years later, there was a round spot on the top of his head where there was no hair."

And at no time of the year are thank-you notes more visible (or lacking) than June, the month of graduations, and the beginning of summer parties. ""It's a must-do thing. A real thank you does not come by e-mail. It comes in the mail in an envelope.

Handwritten thank-you notes--any handwritten correspondence, for that matter- have taken on an air of extra importance and dignity in this e-hyper world.

In the United States, it is widely thought to have helped deepen the sectional conflict that led to civil war. Stowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an active abolitionist , focused the novel on the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering Black slave around whose life revolved the stories of other characters--both fellow slaves and slave owners. Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel, and the second best-selling book following the Bible, of the 19th century and is credited with helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States alone. The book's influence was so great that when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe at the start of the American Civil War, Lincoln is often quoted as having declared, ""So this is the little lady who made this big war."" The book also helped create a number of common stereotypes about Blacks, many of which are still popular to this day. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned mother; the stereotype of black children and so on. The book opened with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife(Emily Shelby) believed that they had a good relationship with their slaves, Shelby decided to raise the needed funds by selling two of them--Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza--to a slave trader."

Why does Edward write this letter?	Dear Ms. Wang, I am writing to inform you of some arrangements about my composition course and Latin course next year. I've decided to re-establish the 5-paragraph essay as the goal for the composition course. I interviewed some of my former students and they all agreed that being able to write critically and continuouslywas important to them. So next academic year, Term 1 will be like always: sentences to paragraphing. And Term 2 will work toward the 5-paragraph essay. The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved tointroduce writing for TOEFL and CEE. By that time, if the students have done their job correctly, then they should be able to write quite well. As for the Latin course, I will post notices around campus next week so that the students will understand what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students already emailed me about the course. I am sure you don't understand what a big deal our opening this program at our school is. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available to the students who succeed in the course. Please share what I have said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I have contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) isthatI have confidence in our students and in myself. I know that when those professors meet our students and hear them speaking and reading Latin, they are going to be amazed. It will open all sorts of doors for students that they never even thought of knocking on. Well, that's it for now. I'll see you soon. Yours, Edward Johnson	['To inform the school of his course plans.']

Who gave detailed suggestions about using cellphones while driving?	Should people be allowed to use cellphones while driving? Alejandra Pachecho from Venezuela: No. Why not? That is because in this world some people drive very crazily. Also, most people who use cellphones to talk in the car usually pay more attention to what they are talking about than to driving. One of the reasons that I feel this way is that ny friend had a car accident while using a cellphone. He lost his life and his friends did, too. Rodrigo Cruz from Colombia: That depends. The a dvantages of using a cellphone while driving are that you can call the police if there is a car accident, call for help when somebody's car breaks down, and call when somebody needs something before arriving home or at the office. The disadvantages is that people get distracted when they are driving at the same time they are talking on a cellular phone. It can cause car accidents. Carl Khalid from Saudi Arabia: No. I would recommend if you want to use a cellphone while you're driving, pull over and take your time. You will avoid a lot of trouble. There are many advantages of using cellphones in cars. In emergencies such as accidents, a flat tire or engine problem, the cellphone is useful for calling 911 for help. Using the cellphone while driving can save time, but using it while driving can alsocause a lot of problems such as missing a red light or signs, not observing cars, or not paying attention to the speed limit. It causes a lot of problems. All these problems could cause loss of concentration. Mirna Hazim: Yes. A cellphone is helpful; it is one of the most important communication devices. For example, if you want to talk with somebody for an important reason, you can. One time when I was coming back from work at 10 o'clock at night, I had a problem with my car. It wouldn't move. I was scared to go into a store to call my brother because I didn't know the places there. I thought it could be dangerous. That night, I found out that owning a cellphone is important.

Why did the driver ask the old woman to clean that mirror?	"A young woman was driving alone through the countryside. It was getting dark and raining. Suddenly she saw an old woman by the side of the road, holding out her hand as if she needed a lift. ""I can't leave her out in this weather,"" the woman said to herself, so she stopped the car and opened the glass. ""Do you want a lift?"" she asked. The old woman nodded and climbed into the car. After a while she said to the old woman, ""Have you waited for long?"" The old woman shook her head. ""Strange,"" thought the young woman. She tried again, ""Bad weather for the time of year,"" she said. The old woman nodded. Although the driver tried some, the lady said nothing except a nod of head or something else like that. Then the young woman saw the lady's hands, they were very large and with thick hair. Suddenly, she realized that the lady was a man! She stopped the car. ""I can't see that mirror,"" she said, ""Would you mind cleaning it for me?"" The lady nodded and opened the door. As soon as the lady was out of the car, the young woman drove off quickly. When she got to the next village, she stopped. She found that the old lady had left a handbag on the backseat. She picked it up and opened it. She gave out a deep breath. Inside it was a gun!"

People have different ways of greeting each other except _ .	People have different ways of greeting each other. They might shake hands , kiss or hug . But do you ever wonder how dogs say hello? If you are a dog lover, you already know the answer to this question. When you arrive home, your dog jumps up into your lap . It wags its tail, and sometimes gives you wet kisses. Like humans, dogs have five senses : smell, touch, sight, hearing and taste. Humans use sight as the main sense for recognizing one another. But dogs have poor eyesight. They use smell to recognize others. A dog's sense of smell is much better than a human's. It is through its sense of smell that tells the differences between different people. Dogs use smell to recognize other dogs, too. They tell the differences by the smell of pee and pooh . When two dogs meet, they smell each other's noses. Then they go side to side, and smell each other's butts . By smelling its friend's behind, a dog knows who it is with. That is also why dogs smell everything they can on the road. By smelling grass, trees and signposts , dogs know which other neighborhood dogs have been around.	['jump']
What did the public do to support Alex and her cause?	"Alexandra Scott was born to Liz and Jay Scott in Manchester,Connecticut on January 18, 1996,the second of four children. Shortly before her first birthday,Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma,a type of childhood cancer. On her first birthday, the doctors informed Alex's parents that if she beat her cancer it was doubtful that she would ever walk again. Just two weeks later,Alex slightly moved her leg at her parents' request to kick. This was the first indication that she would turn out to be a courageous and confident child with big dreams and big accomplishments. By her second birthday,Alex was able to stand up with leg braces .She worked hard to gain strength and to learn how to walk. She appeared to be overcoming the difficulties, until the shocking discovery within the next year that her tumors had started growing again. In the year 2000,the day after her fourth birthday,Alex received a stem cell transplant and informed her mother,""When I get out of the hospital I want to have a lemonade stand.

What's a problem for the career people from this passage?	"One of the problems career people have in the morning is dressing for the office when there will be an evening party immediately followed, with no time to return home to change. The easiest solution is to keep a full set of toiletries and make-ups stored somewhere at the office. A woman going to an evening party should dress in one of her ""basic dresses"" in the morning--the kind that can change into a different look with an added scarf or jewelry. In fifteen minutes, when her office day has ended, she can metamorphose herself into another person with freshly cleaned teeth, combed hair, a new face, a different and dressier pair of shoes, and some sparkling jewelry. If she must wear a long dress for the party, she should bring it to the office in a protective bag and store it safely until she has to put it on."

By writing the passage, the author mainly wants to _ .	"It is well known that the United States' population come from all over the world. The immigrants can learn the language, English, to keep this country united, but it is unnecessary to change their culture for an American way of life. I believe that recent immigrants should learn English in order to live in the country. They should learn the ""public language"". If they don't learn English, they won't be able to communicate and do what they want. For example, my mother's friend came to the United States from Ecuador three years ago. She doesn't speak English. One day, her daughter, Anita, couldn't breathe. Anita didn't know what was going on, but she told her mother to call an ambulance. When her mother called the hospital, she couldn't communicate. The operator couldn't understand what Anita's mother was saying. Fortunately, her mother's sister arrived and called the ambulance. The doctor told her sister that if she hadn't arrived at the hospital on time, Anita could have died. A pill had gotten stuck in her throat. Immigrants should learn English to speak with the public, but they can also keep their language at home. The children of immigrants should learn how to speak their parents' language. It is very important to communicate with our relatives and family. If we learn English only and forget our private ""language"", we won't be able to communicate with our parents. For example, Florence, my co-worker, speaks English only. Her mother didn't teach her Spanish (her mother's mother language). Now, Florence can't communicate with her grandparents or other relatives in Puerto Rico. She has lost her mother's mother language, tradition and culture. Immigrants have the freedom to keep their culture and values. Immigrants should know where they come from and what their family's culture is. In this way, they can transmit it to future generations. In conclusion, immigrants should learn English in order to communicate with the public and to keep the country united, but they shouldn't give up their own culture."

According to the writer ,Christmas music or songs need _ .	"Everybody is familiar with Christmas music; its played everywhere. Whether it's the music from a grocery store or random songs on the radio, holiday music remains to flood in the air from the day after Thanksgiving to the beginning of December. Christmas music gets extremely over- played through the Holiday season. ""'I think the common seasonal Christmas music is annoying because it keeps being played over and over.""said junior Devin McFarland. The Christmas music still played today is what she heard in her childhood. Some famous Christmas songs have never been changed. The original music is played so much that in some cases people dream about or even sing Christmas music in their sleep. She wishes that there was a wider variety of songs. She likes the newer Christmas songs that bands either re- make or write themselves. ""They have a fresher sound to Christmas songs, and they add their own characteristics to them so that they are more like their own songs. "" McFarland explained. Christmas is known as a happy and homecoming festival, so the holiday season is meant to be spent happily with your family. It is recognized that the music media wants to get the point across and add to the festival atmosphere. But isn't the music being pushed to the public too much? Most grocery stores play the music non-stop ,Christmas song after Christmas song, disgusting the customers who don't like that kind of music. You can walk through stores and attempt turning off the music, but sometimes it's impossible to do so. On the other hand, almost everyone has witnessed random persons walking along happily and either singing or whistling to the tune of the song that's played throughout the store."	['reforming']
If your fingers are wounded by knife, fire or other means, the structure of skin will _ .	"Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to ""develop"" them. Some of the marks found are incomplete but identification is possible if a print of a quarter of an inch square can be obtained."	['be the same when the wound is recovered']

The phone came with an 18-point set of terms and conditions that he had to agree to before the phone could be his. And the agreement did not come from Apple or the phone provider, it was from his mother. His mom, Janell Hoffman, included a contract along with the iphone that listed eighteen conditions or rules that Greg has to follow if he wants to keep it. Some of the rules limit the time he can use the phone; not after 7:30 p.m , and he can't take it to school. He also has to promise not to send ""hurtful"" text messages and e-mails to people; give his passwords to his parents, and always answer the phone when his mom or dad calls. Greg also has to use his own money to replace the phone if it's broken or lost Janell says the idea behind the contract is to teach her son to have a sense of responsibility and to learn to ""co-exist with technology, not be ruled by it'. She told him not to use this technology to lie, fool, or cheat another human being. Most of the terms do not just apply to the iphone, but to life. She also advised him to, ""keep your eyes up. See the world happening around you,"" ""Stare out a window. Listen to the birds. Take a walk. Talk to a stranger. Wonder without Googling."" ""You are growing up in a fast and ever changing world. It is exciting and enticing. Trust your powerful mind and giant heart above any machine.

The executive slowed down because _ .	"A young and handsome executive was driving down a neighborhood street. He thought he saw something. Then he slowed down, watching out for children rushing out from between parked cars. As his car passed, no kids appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into his door! He slammed on the brakes (make his car stop). The angry driver then jumped out of his car, caught the nearest child and pushed him up against a parked car, shouting, ""Who are you and what was that all about?"" The little boy was full of apology, ""Please,Mister... Please, I'm sorry...I didn't know what else I could do. I threw the brick because no one else would stop."" With tears dripping down his face, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car. ""It's my brother,"" he said. ""He fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up."" Now weeping, the boy asked the executive, ""Would you please help me to get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me."" Touched beyond words, the executive tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the boy back into the wheelchair, then took out his fancy handkerchief and dabbed (a light touch) at the fresh scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay. ""Thank you and may God bless you."" The grateful child told the stranger. Shaken up for words, the man simply watched the little boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home. God whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don't have time to listen, he has to throw a brick at us. Don't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!"

Which of the following is true according to the writer?	Many psychologists in the early twentieth century believed that humans use only 10 percent of their brains, and even the great Albert Einstein once wrote that most people use only a small portion of the grey matter between their ears. It's a theory that has often been put forward in television documentaries; magazines, advertisements and books over the past century. But nearly all scientists now agree the 10 percent theory is completely . In fact, they question how this figure was ever arrived at in the first place and what areas of the brain are supposed to be unneeded. The theory supposes that if 90 percent of the brain were removed, a person would Still be able to function normally, while in reality it is known that damage to even a small area of the brain can result in extremely serious physical injury different activities and that many areas of the brain are used at the same time for some complex activities or thought processes. Throughout the course of one day, most .areas of the brain are active at some time, even during sleep. The 10 percent theory suggests that certain areas o' the brain are not used, but scans slow activities throughout the entire brain and not in any separate part. The final argument against the 10 percent theory is the fact that doctors carefully map the brain before removing brain cancers so that they don't affect other essential areas. From an evolutionary point of view, it's highly unlikely butt our comparatively larger brains would have evolved from our ancestors if the extra areas were not needed. In fact, there is absolutely no evidence support the 10 percent theory.	['The 10 percent theory does not make evolutionary sense.']
The attitude of the writer towards the mobile payment is _ .	"San Francisco(People's Daily Online)-- Apple Inc. Tuesday introduced its mobile payment service Apple Pay alongside the company's iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California. What apple does is to replace consumers' wallet with its cell phone. Apple said it hopes to speed up the checkout process, make credit-card payments more secure and ultimately, to replace physical wallets. With the near-field communication technology, Apple's gadgets like iPhone and Apple watch can transmit a radio signal between the device and a receiver when the two are in an inch apart. ""To pay, just hold your iPhone near the contactless reader with your finger on Touch ID. You don't even have to look at the screen to know your payment information was successfully sent,"" Apple says on its official website. Apple said that each transaction would be authorized with a one-time, unique number, creating a security code that it said is more secure than the one on the back of your credit card because cashiers won't see your name, card number or security code. The service will work with the three major payment networks -- American Express, MasterCard and Visa -- and Apple said that there are 220,000 merchant locations that accept these contactless payments. When some applaud this disrupted service that will compete with Paypal and endanger other online payment companies, some others concern about its safety, especially when another retailer Home Depot confirmed a data opening yesterday and iCloud was reported exposing nude pictures of celebrities a week ago.

Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province.

""Let's clean this place up,"" said Juliet. Then they began to pick up the trash, talking and laughing. Soon all the bags were full. ""We need to come back another day.

Which of the following BEST gives the main idea of this passage?	"Beldon and Canfield are two seashore towns, not far apart. Both towns have many hotels, and in summer the hotels are full of holiday-makers and other tourists. Last August there was a fire at the Seabreeze Hotel in Beldon. The next day this news appeared on Page Two of the town's newspaper, The Beldon Post. FIRE AT SEABREEZE Late last night firemen hurried to the Seabreeze Hotel and quickly put out a small fire in a bedroom. The hotel manager said that a cigarette started the fire. We say again to all our visitors, ""Please don't smoke cigarettes in bed."" This was Beldon's first hotel fire for five years. The canfield times gave the news in these words on Page One: ANOTHER BELDON HOTEL CATCHES FIRE Last night Beldon firemen arrived just too late to save clothing, bedclothes and some furniture at the Seabreeze Hotel. An angry holiday-maker said, "" An electric lamp probably started the fire. The bedroom lamps are very old at some of these hotels. When I turned the bedside light on, I heard a funny noise from the lamp."" We are glad to tell our readers that this sort of adventure does not happen in Canfield. What are the facts, then? It is never easy to find out the exact truth about an accident. There was a fire at the Seabreeze Hotel 1st August: that is one fact. Do we know anything else? Yes, we know that firemen went to the hotel."	['It was not easy to find out exact truth from newspapers']
Why did the Indians want to make friends with him?	Daniel Boone was born in the United States in 1734. He didn't go to school and couldn't read, although he learned all about the forests, streams and hunting. He could move silently like an Indian leaving no marks. He loved to live alone in the woods where nothing frightened him. When he grew up, he married and tried to settle down on a farm. A year later, however, he wasn't satisfied and decided to go into the unknown western lands, crossing the Appalachian Mountains. When he returned after two years, he became famous for his long journey. He brought valuable animal skins and told stories about the Indians. After this, he chose to keep travelling to unknown places. Once he lost to the Indians in battle and was taken away. The Indians liked him and became his friends. Daniel Boone died at the age of 86. He is remembered as an explorer and a pioneer who lived an exciting life in the early years of American nation.	['No reason is told in this article.']
We can infer from the passage that the writer expressed love to her husband in that _ .	"My day began on a definitely sour note when I saw my six-year-old wrestling with a limb of my azalea bush. By the time I got outside, he'd broken it. ""Can I take this to school today?"" he asked. With a wave of my hand, I sent him off. I turned my back so he wouldn't see the tears gathering in my eyes. The washing machine had leaked on my brand-new linoleum. If only my husband had just taken the time to fix it the night before when I asked him instead of playing checkers with Jonathan. It was days like this that made me want to quit. I just wanted to drive up to the mountains, hide in a cave, and never come out. Somehow I spent most of the day washing and drying clothes and thinking how love had disappeared from my life. As I finished hanging up the last of my husband's shirts, I looked at the clock. 2:30. I was late. Jonathan's class let out at 2:15 and I hurriedly drove to the school. I was out of breath by the time I knocked on the teacher's door and peered through the glass. She rustled through the door and took me aside. ""I want to talk to you about Jonathan,"" she said. I prepared myself for the worst. Nothing would have surprised me. ""Did you know Jonathan brought flowers to school today?"" she asked. I nodded, thinking about my favorite bush and trying to hide the hurt in my eyes. ""Let me tell you about yesterday,"" the teacher insisted. ""See that little girl?"" I watched the bright-eyed child laugh and point to a colorful picture taped to the wall. I nodded. ""Well, yesterday she was almost hysterical. Her mother and father are going through a nasty divorce. She told me she didn't want to live, she wished she could die. I watched that little girl bury her face in her hands and say loud enough for the class to hear, 'Nobody loves me.' I did all I could to comfort her, but it only seemed to make matters worse."" ""I thought you wanted to talk to me about Jonathan,"" I said. ""I do,"" she said, touching the sleeve of my blouse. ""Today your son walked straight over to that child. I watched him hand her some pretty pink flowers and whisper, 'I love you.'"" I felt my heart swell with pride for what my son had done. I smiled at the teacher. ""Thank you,"" I said, reaching for Jonathan's hand, ""you've made my day."" Later that evening, I began pulling weeds from around my azalea bush. As my mind wandered back to the love Jonathan showed the little girl, a biblical verse came to me: ""...these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."" While my son had put love into practice, I had only felt anger. I heard the familiar squeak of my husband's brakes as he pulled into the drive. I snapped a small limb bristling with hot pink azaleas off the bush. I felt the seed of love that God planted in my family beginning to bloom once again in me. My husband's eyes widened in surprise as I handed him the flowers. ""I love you,"" I said."	['she was inspired by her son that love was supposed to be felt and practiced']

According to the writer, what should you do if you want to refuse the other person's request?	"Most people say ""yes"" much more readily than ""no"". A friend is moving house this weekend and would like some help, and you agree. But, what you really wanted was a couple of quiet days relaxing at home. Or a roommate spends the entire weekends playing video games and wants to borrow your homework for ""reference"". You say ""yes"". Many people say ""yes"" to these kinds of requests. They tend not to consider their own interests and feelings, and are often angry with themselves afterwards . Saying ""no"" requires courage and considerable practice, in fact, according to psychologists. ""Everyone wants to be liked,"" says Gabriele Steinki, a German psychologist. ""Saying 'no' risks losing the affection of the person asking the favor or even a job."" The result is that many people say ""yes"" just for keeping the peace. But experts say this is regrettable. Anyone should have the right to say ""no"". In fact, rejecting a request can even help to strengthen a relationship because it expresses a true feeling. But, for people used to agreeing to every request, changing can be a long and uncomfortable learning process. Most people believe that ""If I say 'no', I'll lose the affection of the person. But the affection is important to me."" This way of thinking can be replaced by this: ""If he only likes me because I always do what suits him , the price of his affection is too high in the long term."" Steinki says the key is talking to the other person to find a mutual solution. ""One needs to present the situation from one's own point of view, and to suggest how the situation can be dealt with to the advantage of both parties. The other person must have the feeling that his interests are being considered."" When the refusal is not accepted, Steinki advises us to give the reasons calmly again until the person gets the message ."	['Talk to the other person to find a mutual way.']
"The most suitable title for the passage is "" _ ""."	Every New Year brings renewed expectation for a change, for a better life and for a better you. That's a wonderful thing, because this fresh start gives us a chance to reinvent our lives and ourselves. Here's how. Let go Many times we are held back by our previous failures,emotions and barriers . This is all old baggage. Let everything unhappy from the past go. Let go of failures. Let go of fears you've built up. Let go of your ideas about what your life has to be like. Let go of long-held beliefs and habits which seem to be burdens to you. Clear away distractions Clear away email, your favourite blogs and news websites. Clearaway the iPhone or Blackberry, and clear away all the _ that pull at your attention. In fact, if you can, shut off the Internet for a while. You can come back to it after you take a break. Decide what matters most today Forget about your goals for all of this year. Instead, decide what you want to do today. What matters most to you and your life? What are you most passionate about right now? What excites you? What gives you the most fulfillment ? Often the answer would be in creating something, making something new, helping others, becoming a better person, and working on a project that you will be proud of. But whatever your answer, have it clear in your mind at the beginning of the day. Reinvent yourself every day Every day, you are reborn.Reinvent yourself and your life. Do what matters most to you. It might be the same thing that mattered most yesterday, or it might not be. That isn't important. What's important is today---right now! Be passionate, and be happy! You'll have a fresh start every single day---not just on January 1 of a new year.	['Freshen the Start of Every New Day']
What does the writer realize now that he did not realize then?	"The next day I sat down,with almost a hundred other candidates,for the intelligence test.I must have done all right because after about half an hour's wait I was sent into another room for a psychological test.This time there were only about fifty candidates.The interviewer sat at a desk.Candidates were signaled forward to occupy the seat opposite him when the previous occupant had been dismissed,after a greater or shorter time.Obviously the long interviews were the more successful ones.Some of the interviews were as short as five minutes.Mine was the only one that lasted a minute and a half. I can remember the questions now:""Why did you leave your last job?""""Why did you leave your job before that?""""And the one before that?""I can't recall my answers,except that they were short at first and grew progressively shorter.His closing statement,I thought,evealed a lack of sensitivity which helped to explain why as a psychologist,he had risen no higher than the underground railway.""You've failed the psychological test and we are unable to offer you a position."" Failing to get that job was my low point.Or so I thought,believing that the work was easy.Actually,such jobs--being a postman is another one I still desire--demand exactly the sort of elementary yet responsible awareness that the habitual dreamer is least qualified to give.But I was still far short of full self-understanding.I was also short of cash."

What is the author's attitude towards taking selfies according to the passage?	"The smart phones that can take self-portraits or selfies have set us free. We can now document every moment of our life and instantly share it with the world through the Internet. However, some believe that it's also causing people to take unnecessary risks that sometimes prove to be deadly! According to recent reports, the desire to take a breathtaking selfie has killed 12 people. Though that may not seem like a lot, it's 50% more than the death from shark attacks. While the issues have been known for a while, they came to a head on September 21st, following the accidental death of Hideto Ueda at the Taj Mahal. It turns out that the 66-year-old Japanese and his companion were trying to take a selfie with the Royal Gate as the background when they fell down some stairs. While the friend escaped with a broken leg, Ueda was not as fortunate. He suffered a head injury and died soon after. Other fatal accidents include a 21-year-old Russian woman who fell off a bridge while trying to capture an exciting self-portrait. Three Indian students suffered a similar fate after they were run over by a train while taking a selfie on the railway tracks. The rising number of injuries is forcing officials to take measures. Russia has begun a nationwide awareness program to make its young citizens aware of the dangers of this safe hobby. The campaign's slogan is:""Even a million 'likes' on social media are not worth your life and well-being."" Though no other country has followed their lead, many are banning the selfie stick! In the last few months many museums, and theme parks including Disney, have banned its use. JR West became the first institution worldwide to ban the sticks both inside Japan's bullet trains as well as out on the railway platforms. While these measures may help reduce the incidents, the only way to stop selfie-related injuries and deaths is to take responsibility -- not just for themselves but their friends. So next time you decide to take a selfie that appears a little risky, be sure to stop and ask yourself -- is it worth it?"	['Cautious.']
When a dog pulls its ears behind with the mouth open, we can tell it _ .	Man is the most intelligent animal created by God because God has given him language which other animals do not have. Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other? We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal communication and non-verbal communication. Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals. Facial Expressions This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face. Gestures and Body Movements This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use gestures and body movements as well while communicating. Honey bees are the most enthusiastic creatures on earth because they dance to communicate. Some bees dance in the hive so that other bees get signals of the location of the honey comb. A deer waves its tail to warn others of coming danger.	['is frightened']
Green buildings are built near public transportation mainly for the purpose of _ .	"These days a green building means more than just the color1 of the paint. Green building can also refer to environmentally friendly houses, factories, and offices. Green building means ""reducing the effect of the building on the land,"" Taryn Holowka of the US Green Building Council in prefix = st1 /Washington,DC, said. According to Holowka, buildings account for 65 percent of total USelectricity use. But green buildings can reduce energy and water use. Also, the buildings are often located near public transportation such as buses and subways, so that people can drive their cars less. That could be good for the environment, because cars use lots of natural resources, such as gasoline, and give off pollution. Green buildings are often built on developed land, so that the buildings don't destroy forests or other wild habitats. Marty Dettling is project manager for a building that put these ideas into action. The Solaire has been called the country's first green residential high-rise building. According to Dettling, ""We've reduced our energy consumption by one-third and our water by 50 percent. The Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power. The Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off when people leave the room. Plus, the building has lots of windows. This allows people to use the sun for light instead of lamps during the day."	['protecting the environment']
What do you expect the official would do in the end?	"Angus MacLeod was fifty and he had spent his entire life as a shepherd in the remote mountainous region of northwest Scotland. He had never owned a radio or television nor had he travelled further than forty kilometres from his birthplace. His knowledge of the world was gained only from his brief trips to the village to sell his sheep and buy food. However, he had lately come to rely on the growing number of hill-walkers in the region as sources of international news. In the spring of 1992, a Spanish student came across Angus high in the mountains. Eager to practise his English he engaged Angus in conversation. The student told Angus of the forthcoming Olympic Games in Barcelona. Excited by the student's colourful description of Spain and the Games, Angus decided to attend the event in person and two months later arrived in Barcelona. The ticketless Angus stood outside the stadium with his canny brain working overtime, watching a growing number of individuals entering the stadium through a small entrance at the side. He noticed that they all seemed to be carrying objects. Perhaps they were workmen, he thought. He moved closer and watched. Within minutes a thin young man came along carrying an extremely long pole. He approached the official at the door and said ""Pole Vault"". The official moved to the side and the man entered. Next came a heavy-set man with a spear. Angus wondered how a man could carry such a dangerous weapon in a modern city. The man shouted "" Javelin "" and was presently admitted. Angus was puzzled. Perhaps they were all connected with security. His puzzlement grew when a huge man appeared with a steel ball in his hand. He shouted ""Shot Putt"" and walked past the official. It suddenly dawned on Angus that these people were competitors. He opened his programme and sure enough under the heading ""events"" he saw the three words the men had said. Angus laughed to himself as a plan began to take shape in his mind. First he needed to buy one or two things. An hour later he reappeared dressed in a tracksuit with ""Scotland"" written across the chest. Over his shoulder he carried a roll of barbed wire . Smiling to himself he walked up to the official and as casually as he could, shouted, ""Fencing!"""	['Refuse to let him in.']
In Chad Dickerson's opinion, the Nexus One is _ the iPhone.	"To switch or not to switch, that is the question.Google's announcement of its Nexus One smartphone happened over a week ago and I'm still receiving lots of e-mails from readers asking the same question: Should they give up their iPhone for the Nexus One? Some people with iPhones, disappointed by American Telephone&Telegraph's inadequate service and the high monthly cost, are wondering if they have really got something to replace it.Does the Nexus One offer the functions that Apple has led them to expect? I'm on the fence myself, even though I never thought I'd be interested in anything but the iPhone.From my experience using the Nexus One, and from talking to people who have made the change, it's not necessarily about the differences between the iPhone and the Nexus One.The phones are extremely similar in design and general feel.Instead, the decision can be made based on the software services you use on your desktop. My friend Chad Dickerson received a pre-launch Nexus One from Google three weeks ago.He said Google's phone feels connected to certain services on the Web in a way the iPhone doesn't.""Compared to the iPhone, the Google phone feels like it's part of the Internet to me,"" he said.""If you live in a Google world, you have that world in your pocket in a way that's cleaner and more connected than the iPhone."" Personally, the phones work perfectly with their own software, but both of them don't make an effort to play well with other services."	['better than']
The CV has become such an important document because _ .	"There is a new type of small advertisement becoming increasingly common in newspaper classified columns.It is sometimes placed among ""situations vacant"", although it does not offer anyone a job, and sometimes it appears among ""situations wanted"", although it is not placed by someone looking for a job, either.What it does is to offer help in applying for a job. ""Contact us before writing your application"", or ""Make use of our long experience in preparing your curriculum vitae or job history"", is how it is usually expressed.The growth and apparent success of such a specialized service is, of course, a reflection on the current high levels of unemployment.It is also an indication of the growing importance of the CV, with the suggestion that it may now qualify as an art form in its own right. There was a time when job seekers simply wrote letters of application.""Just put down your name, address, age and whether you have passed any exams"", was about the average level of advice offered to young people applying for their first jobs when I left school.The letter was really just for openers, it was explained, everything else could and should be saved for the interview.And in those days of full employment the technique worked.The letter proved that you could write and were available for work.Your eager face and intelligent replies did the rest. There is no doubt, however, that it is increasing number of applicants with university education at all points in the process of engaging staff that has led to the greater importance of the CV."

We can learn from the passage that _ .	It's not Christmas Day yet. But wherever I go on the streets, I see shops selling Christmas trees and all kinds of beautiful decorations, waiters wearing Christmas hats; I hear children singing Christmas songs on broadcast; I get messages of Christmas's best wishes from friends. I just got quite confused again, since when have Chinese begun celebrating Christmas Day? What do these people celebrate it for, the birth of Chris? But we all know that most of Chinese are not Christians, they don't even know the origin of Christmas Day, and they celebrate it for no reason. I don't celebrate Christmas Day or any other western holidays since I'm not a Christian and nor am I a westerner. I don't know what Christmas really means. Anyway I can't get reasonable answers from my friends. Some of them think they would like to just take this chance to enjoy themselves regardless of the meaning of the festival. Some of them think I'm an old-fashioned girl, a _ who doesn't appreciate the spirit of Chinese cultural tolerance and understanding of other cultures. Well, if it is about cultural tolerance, why don't we ever celebrate the month of Muharram, or festivals of colours in India, or Fiestas Patrias in Mexico? I really appreciate cultural exchanges and communications with all nations, but I don't think this is what it's about. People are celebrating more and more western festivals while ignoring our traditional ones. Is it part of globalization ? Do people in other non-western countries also celebrate Christmas?

According to the passage, in which of the following situations can you feel happy?	It is a hot summer day,and you feel thirsty. A friend gives you a glass of cold lemonade.How do you feel when you see the glass? Will you describe your feeling as happiness or as pleasure? I believe you will say it is a feeling of pleasure.There is a connection between these two kinds of feelings,and sometimes one causes the other,but they are not the same.Pleasure is more dependent on the five senses while happiness is independent of them. When you are happy,little unpleasant events usually do not disturb you.When you are unhappy,you feel as if everything is against you.You may compensate for it by eating chocolate and sweets because this gives you pleasure;yet you stay unhappy.A person may smoke cigarettes because it gives him pleasure,yet,this does not make him happier,especially if he knows the fact that it is not good for his health The physical world is always in a changing state.At each moment a new thing is being created,changed,transformed and then destroyed.This is the normal state of things and no one can change it.If we stay still in a certain state,we are sure to experience unhappiness sooner or later.On the other hand,if we adjust to the environment,nothing can influence our moods.Then outer events have nothing to do with our inner joy of mind. The room of the mind was filled with worry or fear.If you are free of thinking about them, the room has been emptied,and then you will see what is happening and experience it When your mind stays quiet,you will see that happiness comes from the inside.

"""You look lovely"" and ""Sorry, I had no signal"" ranked _ on the popular-lie list."	"Britain's most popular lie has been disclosed, with one in four people admitting using ""sorry I had no signal"" when returning a missed mobile phone call, a survey found. Researchers found the average Briton tells on average four lies every day or almost 1500 every year. Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the ""ignore"" button when their mobile rang. Three quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men. The second most common _ is ""I haven't got any cash on me"" when asked for money by beggars and Big Issue sellers. ""Nothing's wrong - I'm fine"" came third followed by ""You look lovely"" and ""Nice to see you"". Modern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with ""I didn't get your text"" in 18th, ""Our server was down"" in 20th and ""My battery died"" in 26th place. Other lies to make the top ten included ""I'll give you a ring"", ""We're just good friends"" and ""We'll have to meet up soon"". ""I'm on my way"" and ""No, your bum doesn't look big in that"" completed the top ten. In many cases perhaps it is better to delight someone with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults. He added: 'As a nation we just like trying to be nice and not upsetting people. Often little white lies can cover what we actually want to say. Most of these were considered completely harmless.

Narwani and her team found that _ .	Five times in the earth's history, some three-quarters of all living species disappeared forever-and within a short period of time. Those species losses stand for a major change in the planet's ecology . Clues to these changes can be seen in the fossils and rock layers. Today, human activities are driving species to die out at a rate never seen before. And this loss of species really does matter, said Anita Narwani. She works at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. That's because the diversity of species in an ecosystem provides people with all types of services we can't do without. Trees provide oxygen for us to breathe. At the same time, they remove carbon from the air which is a cause of global warming. Plants help clean air and water. Animals move seeds from one area to another. A broad range of living resources also provides people with food, shelter and medicine. Narwani wanted to find out how important the diversity of species is for people. So she teamed up with other ecologists to review more than 1,700 studies. They found that more diverse parts of the earth tend to do well in things like removing carbon and providing us with wood and other natural resources. _ were also better at keeping fisheries large and healthy so that they could feed many people. Unfortunately, the diversity of species is in steep drop. It is too soon to say that the earth is undergoing a sixth mass extinction, Narwani said. She said a mass extinction means the loss of 75 percent of species over 2 million years or less. We haven't lost that many - at least not yet. But according to her, if species losses continue so fast, such a mass extinction could occur in just 300 years. The new findings highlight the potential for humans to use up many of the resources on which we now depend. As people learn more, however, they can take steps to lessen those risks.

He didn't like any subjects except playing when he was at school. Of course he learned nothing and the bosses wouldn't use a man like him. He has to stay at home, but doesn't do any housework, only watches TV or lies on bed. It makes his parents angry. They want him to study something, he always think it difficult and doesn't listen to them. One day Robert was walking near a bookshop while some young men were talking about the writers. He heard the publishing house pays the writers a lot. He became interested in it. As soon as he got home, he began to write. But he couldn't write anything. At last he bought a book and copied a story. Then he posted it to the publishing house. He waited for nearly half a year, but didn't get any answers. He had to ask an editor on the telephone, ""Have you read my story yet, sir?"" ""Yes,"" said the editor, ""I had read it before you were born! """	"[""he's too lazy to do any housework""]"
All of the following are the results of rising prices of food EXCEPT _ .	"Poor families in some countries spend as much as eighty percent of their money on food. Rising prices in recent months have created the worst food crisis in more than thirty years. The United Nations World Food Program says high food prices could push one hundred million people into hunger. Nathan Childs is an expert on rice markets. He notes that the harvest for the latest growing season was the largest on record. But India, Vietnam and others have restricted exports to keep prices down at home and protect supplies. Thailand's agriculture minister says his country will never restrict rice exports. He told the Reuters news agency Thursday that Thailand has enough supplies to meet demand at home and for export. Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. Recent signs of an increase in supplies have helped ease record prices for Thai rice. Prices rose last week above one thousand dollars a ton. Vietnam, the second biggest exporter, has banned exports until June. And Vietnamese officials have now warned that non-food traders who buy rice for speculation will be severely punished. Some experts say speculation is a necessary part of market activity. But the head of the U.N. Environment Program blames it for the high food prices. ""We have enough food on this planet today to feed everyone."" Achim Steiner told the Associated Press. Earlier, a member of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission didn't accept the idea that speculators are the main cause. Bart Chilton blamed reduced harvests and grain supplies and the falling value of the dollar. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called heads of major international agencies to a meeting this week in the Swiss capital, Bern. He says high food prices could harm world trade, economic growth, social progress and political security."	['reduced harvests and grain supplies']
According to the text, which of the following statements is TRUE?	"American government suggests that children and teens should get 60 minutes of physical activity every day. But less than half of children and just 10% of teens meet these suggestions. What's the deal? It's reported that about 44million US kids participate in organized sports(such as baseball, softball, soccer).But a new study says just one-quarter of kids get the government-recommended amount of exercise when they show up for team practices. The study, published online last month in a medical journal, says younger kids and boys do better than teens and girls. The study looked at 200 kids aged 7 to 14 who played on soccer, baseball and softball teams. The kids wore sensors to measure their activity during practices. During each practice, kids averaged 30 minutes of downtime . ""It is not clear how much physical activity is provided by youth sports practices,"" say the California-based authors of the study. ""Much of the time may be inactive, such as receiving verbal instructions and waiting for turns."" What's a parent or coach--or kid--to do? The authors of the study suggest increasing the number of practices, _ the time of practices and changing it up during practices. For example, the coach could give each player a ball at the same time. Rather than focusing on one player's skills, it's best to get the whole team moving. But, the study says, the bottom line is that team sports aren't enough exercise. For a child to meet the US physical activity suggestions, the kid will have to do more than just join a team. Exercise is also necessary during breaks, during physical education class, after school and even on the way to school."

The passage mainly discusses the development of _ .	"When the Spanish first brought chocolate back to Europe,it was still being served as a drink,but soon went through an important change:the chili pepper was replaced by sugar. The new sweetened chocolate drink was so expensive that few could afford,but by the 17th century the drink was common among European noblemen. In England,which was somewhat more equalityfavored than the rest of Europe,chocolate was more widely available. Those who could afford it could enjoy chocolate drinks in the new coffee and chocolate houses of London. As cacao tree became more commonly available,people began experimenting with new ways of using it. Chocolate began to appear in cakes and other foods. But it wasn't until 1828 that the ""modern ear"" of chocolate making and production began. The introduction of cocoa powder not only made creating chocolate drinks much easier,but also made it possible to combine chocolate with sugar and then remix it with cocoa butter to create a solid. Others began to build on Van Houten's success,experimenting to make new chocolate products. In 1849,English chocolate maker Joseph Storrs Fry produced what was the world's first eating chocolate. Today,the Swiss are famous for their chocolate,and rightly so. In the late 19th century,they developed a number of processes that contributed greatly to creating the solid chocolate candy that we all enjoy today. Two major developments occurred in 1879.First,Daniel Peter,a Swiss chocolate producer,had the idea of using powdered milk (invented by Swiss Chemist Henri Nestle in 1867) to make a new kind of chocolate,milk chocolate. Second,Rudolph Lindt invented a process called ""conching"",which greatly improved the quality of chocolate candy by making it more mixable."	['chocolate candies']
What is the main idea of the passage?	"BEIJING--Just as the Chinese people joyfully await the traditional Spring Festival, President Hu Jintao returned here Saturday after successfully concluding a four-day state visit to the United States,which opens a new chapter in cooperative partnership between China and the United States. During his visit,President Hu spared no efforts to make friends,to proclaim China' s philosophy of peaceful development and to express the Chinese people' s willingness to join hands with the world to greet a spring of harmonious development. In Washington,President Hu and his US counterpart,Barack Obama,agreed to build a China-US cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit,and marke d out priorities of the development of China-US relations for the future. Hu met with people from all walks of life in the United States,expounding to them the various policies of the Chinese government and China' s stand on developing China-US ties in the new era. The strengthening of bilateral cooperation and the shaping of a new type of relationship between two great nations will give some enlightenment to the world when tackling regional and international issues,will strengthen the belief of the international communities jointly facing common challenges and will forge a new way for all countries to co-exist harmoniously in a globalized world. During his visit,President Hu stressed that a China-US cooperative partnership should be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. ""Mutual respect and mutual benefit""is not only the keyword in defining China-US relations,but also the principle China honors in the common development with other partners. As a goodwill messenger of a population of 1.3 billion, President Hu' s successful visit will more clearly define the relations between China' s development and the co-prosperity of the world,opening a new chapter in the history of international relations."

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"Blogging has become something of a big thing in the last few years. Just like the Internet was 10 years ago, blogging is popular with an underground culture, that is doing it for love and passion . Blogging is a way of collecting links to webpages and sharing thoughts and ideas with people online. Blogs are basically online diaries which are created for sharing information and ideas. Dominic, a fifth-grade student, writes: ""The blogs give us a chance to communicate between ourselves and encourage us to write more. When we publish on our blog, people across the whole world can reply by using the 'comments' link. In this way, they can ask questions or simply tell us what they like. We can then know if people like what we write and this will tell us where we can improve. By reading these comments, we can discover our weaknesses and our strengths. Blogging is a chance to exchange our opinions with the rest of the world rather than just people in our immediate environment."" Blogging is sweeping the Internet. A recent report states that at least three million Americans have created blogs, with similar numbers being seen worldwide. Two years ago, Andrew Sullivan decided to set up a Web page himself and used ""Blogger. com"" to publish some daily thoughts to a few hundred readers. He worked hard at the blog for months for no reward. But the result is that he is now reaching almost a quarter of a million readers a month and making a lot of money. This, at least, is the idea: a publishing revolution is coming. ""Blogger.com"" could be to words what Napster was to music--except this time, it'll really work."

Which of the following words can best describe Mary Smith?	"I was puzzled! Why was this old woman making such a fuss about an old copse which was of no use to anybody? She had written letters to the local paper, even to a national, protesting about a projected by-pass to her village, and, looking at a map, the route was nowhere near where she lived and it wasn't as if the area was attractive. I was more than puzzled, I was curious. The enquiry into the route of the new by-pass to the village was due to take place shortly, and I wanted to know what it was that motivated her. So it was that I found myself knocking on a cottage door, being received by Mary Smith and then being taken for a walk to the woods. ""I've always loved this place,"" she said, ""it has a lot of memories for me, and for others. We all used it. They called it 'Lovers lane'. It's not much of a lane, and it doesn't go anywhere important, but that's why we all came here. To be away from people, to be by ourselves. "" she added. It was indeed pleasant that day and the songs of many birds could be heard. Squirrels watched from the branches, quite bold in their movements, obviously few people passed this way and they had nothing to fear. I could imagine the noise of vehicles passing through these peaceful woods when the by-pass was built, so _ but as I hold strong opinions about the needs of the community over-riding the opinions of private individuals, I said nothing. The village was quite a dangerous place because of the traffic especially for old people and children, their safety was more important to me than an old woman's strange ideas. ""Take this tree,"" she said pausing after a short while. ""To you it is just that, a tree. Not unlike many others here."" She gently touched the bark, ""Look here, under this branch, what can you see?"" ""It looks as if someone has done a bit of carving with a knife."" I said after a cursory inspection. ""Yes, that's what it is!"" she said softly. She went on, ""He had a penknife with a spike for getting stones from a horse's hoof, and I helped him to carve them. We were very much in love, but he was going away, and could not tell me what he was involved in the army. I had guessed of course. It was the last evening we ever spent together, because he went away the next day, back to his Unit."" Mary Smith was quiet for a while, then she sobbed. ""His mother showed me the telegram. 'Sergeant R Holmes ...Killed in action in the invasion of France.'..."" ""I had hoped that you and Robin would one day get married."" she said, ""He was my only child, and I would have loved to be a Granny, they would have been such lovely babies'- she was like that! "" ""Two years later she too was dead. 'Pneumonia , following a chill on the chest' was what the doctor said, but I think it was an old fashioned broken heart. A child would have helped both of us."" There was a further pause. Mary Smith gently caressed the wounded tree, just as she would have caressed him. ""And now they want to take our tree away from me."" Another quiet sob, then she turned to me. ""I was young and pretty then, I could have had anybody, I wasn't always the old woman you see here now. I had everything I wanted in life, a lovely man, health and a future to look forward to."" She paused again and looked around. The breeze gently moved through the leaves with a sighing sound. ""There were others, of course, but no one can match my Robin!"" she said strongly. ""And now I have nothing - except the memories this tree holds. If only I could get my hands on that awful man who writes in the paper about the value of the road they are going to build where we are standing now, I would tell him. Has he never loved, has he never lived, does he not know anything about memories? We were not the only ones, you know, I still meet some who came here as Robin and I did. Yes, I would tell him!"" I turned away, sick at heart."	['Faithful.']
Why are trade names protected by law in many countries?	"The right name is important in the business world. All you have to do is think of the names for some of the products you buy every day and you'll agree that the name and the product are connected in everyone's mind. In many countries, successful trade or brand names are protected by law. This is so that other companies cannot make a product that looks like another. People might think that they were buying one product and, in fact, be buying something different. Businesses register a company or a product name with the government. In fact, more than 1,000 product and company names are registered every hour. Many companies spend a lot of money to find the right name for their products. A good example of this is in the car industry. Some successful names for cars have powerful associations. The Ford Mustang and the Jaguar are only two examples of choosing the names of animals that are fast and strong. When a U.S. company decides to sell its product in another country, it has to make sure that the product name translates properly. When Coca-Cola introduced its soft drink to China, it looked for the right name. It wanted a name that would do two things. One was to present its image in Chinese and the second was to be close to its first brand name -Coke. It took some efforts before finding the right word - which sounds similar and translates as ""happiness in the mouth"". Asian company names are not new to the United States. The brand names of Samsung and Sony have been successful. Finding the right brand name is a big business. Asian companies that sell to foreign markets pay to find a name that will connect with its customers. There are even naming companies that specialize in inventing product names. These companies can charge up to $ 100,000 a word for their creations. But it's worth it. Successful companies know how important the right brand names are for their development."

Matter on the sun can exist only in the form of gas because of the sun's _ .	The temperature of the sun is over 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface, but it rises to perhaps more than 16 million degrees at the center. The sun is so much hotter than the earth that matter can exist only as a gas, except at the core. In the core of the sun, the pressures are so great against the gases that, despite the high temperature, there may be a small solid core. However, no one really knows, since the center of the sun can never be directly observed. Solar astronomers do know that the sun is divided into five layers or zones. Starting at the outside and going down into the sun, the zones are the corona, chromosphere, photosphere, convection zone and finally the core. The first three zones are regarded as the sun's atmosphere ends and the main body of the sun begins. The sun's outermost layer begins about 10,000 miles above the visible surface and goes outward for millions of miles. This is the only part of the sun that can be seen during an eclipse such as the one in February 1979. At any other time, the corona can be seen only when special instruments are used on cameras and telescopes to shut out the glare of the sun's rays. The corona is a brilliant, pearly white, filmy light, about as bright as the full moon. Its beautiful rays are a sensational sight during an eclipse. The corona's rays flash out in a brilliant fan that has wispy spikelike rays near the sun's north and south poles. The corona is thickest at the sun's equator. The corona rays are made up of gases streaming outward at tremendous speeds and reaching a temperature of more than 2 million degrees Fahrenheit. The rays of gas thin out as they reach the space around the planets. By the time the sun's corona rays reach the earth, they are weak and invisible.	['temperature']

Daniel, Buremburg, Germany Actually, the original technophobes were the Luddites, a group of cloth workers in 19thcentury Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The Luddite cloth workers, who traditionally made cloth by hand, were worried that machines were going to take away their jobs and way of life. These machines could make cloth much faster and cheaper than humans. In 1811 and 1812 the Luddites destroyed the machines that they hated so much, but the British government supported the factory owners. Many Luddites were arrested. Charlotte Bronte's novel Shirley will tell your parents all about it. Laura, Valencia, Spain Laura makes some interesting points, I think. Technophobes has been a common theme in science fiction. Frankenstein, one of the first science fiction, is a warning of what could happen if humans began to experiment with human life. Freda, Copenhagen, Denmark One thing you could try is to find hardware that is designed for older people to use. An example is the mobiles made by the US company, Jitterbug. Instead of icons and menus the Jitterbug phones ask users simple ""yes/no"" questions and have larger keypads. The company realized that there are potentially 100 million older users in the US alone.

The Bronze You, unearthed in Jiangxi province, has an opening to _ .	"How did the ancient Chinese keep food warm in winter? Facilities like electric rice cookers, microwaves, and electric kettles, make it easy for people to keep food warm and enjoy a comfortable winter. So how did Chinese people in ancient times keep food warm in winter without these? In fact, ancient Chinese people used their own methods of heat preservation as early as the Shang and Zhou dynasties. * ""Wen Ding"", ancient rice cooker One of the major functions of an electric rice cooker is to keep food warm. The ""Wen Ding"", an ancient cooking container, served the same purpose, but instead of using electric energy, the ancient cooking container, served the same purpose, but instead of using electric energy, the ancient cooking container preserved heart by burning fuels like charcoal. The ""Wen Ding"" unearthed in Nanjing in 1989 is thought to be the oldest of its kind discovered in China, dating back to the Stone Age, The craftsmanship of making the ""Wen Ding"" was developed in the Bronze Age. The bronze Ding from Shang and Zhou dynasties took on different shapes and structures. * ""Ran LU"", ancient small hot pot The ""Ran LU"" is a small size cooking vessel made of bronze, which can be divided into three parts. A charcoal stove forms the main structure, with a bottom tray to hold charcoal ashes, and a movable cup at the top. Some experts have concluded that the vessel's structure suggests it may have been used as a small hot pot and that these vessels became popular in the Warring States Period(475--221 BC) *Bronze You, ancient kettle The Bronze You was one of the most common wine containers during the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The Bronze You can also be used to warm wine. For example, the Bronze You with beast mask design, unearthed in Jiangxi province, has an opening where charcoals could be placed. Just as people today can't do without an electric kettle, the Bronze You allowed people to enjoy a hot drink. *Bronze Yan, ancient steamer Although the ""Wen Ding"" was effective at keeping food warm, the ancient Chinese people later found that its burning produced pollution. As a result, the Bronze Yan was made with a two-tier structure and used to steam rice and other grains. After the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25-AD 220), further improvements to the Bronze Yan led to the modern-day steamer."	['place charcoals']
In the view of the author, we know that _ .	Does being rich make you happy? Many studies on happiness give negative answers. Here are some points in being happy. Basic Human Needs Must Be Met People whose basic needs for shelter, clothing and food are not met will find it very difficult to feel happy. Of course, there are exceptions, but for most of us, we can only be happy once our basic needs are met. The Joneses Cannot Be Escaped People's happiness is not determined by how much they have, but by how much people around them have. So, we tend to feel happy once our basic needs are met and we have more than the people surrounding us. This means that while keeping up with _ could be destructive if we let it go too far. It is also part of humana nature to want to feel at least on the same level, financially, as those surrounding us. You Should Escape The Rat Race We should know the importance of staying out of the rat race. So yes, you need to work hard, get the education you need to land a good job and work long enough and hard enough to get to a place where you can easily meet your basic needs. What are basic needs? For most middle or upper middle class Americans, basic needs are not very basic anymore. For most of us, once our basic needs have been met, happiness is achieved when we engage in activities we like, spend time with friends and family and stay active. Making money for the sake of making money does not make people happy. Ideally, these questions should be answered when you're still young and just starting out. Don't wait until your midlife crisis to realize that half your life has passed you by and you're still unhappy.	['human basic needs are fundamental for being happy']
Who helped Liang Bo win the competition?	"Last year The Voice of China, the most popular TV talent show became a popular topic in people's chatting and media information from both home and abroad. It began on July 13, 2012 and ended on September 30, 2012. Liang Bo, a handsome boy from Changchun, Jilin was the champion of The Voice of China in 2012. Before the competition Liang Bo was just an ordinary college student studying music. He captured the hearts of audience with his passionate rock'n'roll performance at the show. Fans described Liang's voice as ""natural, clear and touching''. Although he seemed cool on stage, he could quickly turn on the power once he started singing. ""His performances make you imagine things. When I listen to his singing, I see pictures and think of stories."" said Na Ying, one of the four judges on the show. She was also Liang's tutor for the competition. Liang Bo, like many young Chinese, he fell in love with music through playing the guitar. Liang got his first guitar as a birthday gift when he was in middle school. He would spend days and nights practicing. "" I can't live without my guitar."" he said. "" I don't like talking much but I carry great passion inside me,"" Liang said. "" There is no better way to let it out than through music like rock'n'roll. Many people compare Liang to famous Chinese rockers including Xu Wei, Wang Feng and Zheng Jun. But the young man doesn't want to stand in others' shadow.

What's the author's attitude towards teenagers' constant connection to cell phone?	"Teenagers spend too much time using their cell phones and being connected online these days! Is this a new way to be more social or, does the technology really make them unsocial? And how will this constant connection affect them? My daughter who is fifteen years old has a smart cell phone which means that she is constantly connected to the Internet and of course Facebook. To be around her means that you have to listen to constant ""beeps"" and sounds from the cell phone when her friends update their status. It makes me really stressed. But that is me. For my daughter, the cell phone is an extension to her body. She sleeps with her cell phone on the pillow; she eats with her cell phone nearby; She even takes the cell phone to the bathroom. For the generation who has grown up with the Internet and cell phones, it is important for them to stay close to their cell phones. They get stressed when they are disconnected! And most of them haven't experienced a life without cell phones. For them, being offline or not having a cell phone is like being totally isolated . And when they get online after a long disconnection they are so stressed out, because they have so much catching-up to do! So how is this constant connection affecting the new generation who has been born with the opportunity to stay connected to the Internet all the time? I see them as guinea pigs ! Because nobody knows how _ will affect humans in the long run. No research has been done yet on long-term side effects of being constantly reachable and connected to others. My conclusion is that teenagers' addiction to cell phones makes them both social and unsocial. The new technology has changed the way they connect with people compared to former generations. They are more social and can be mobile but this also forces them to do more than one job at a time which distracts their attention and prevents them from focusing on the present, which makes them unsociable. No one knows how this use will affect humans. We will just have to wait and see."	['Disapproving']

There's a wide choice--- everything is included from cooking to the latest sports news. If you want to read the news, the first thing you have to do is to turn to the index page which has an easy-to-remember page number, 100 for example. Then you start choosing what you want to read. The news is on pages 101 to 109, so you push out the numbers and the news appears written across your screen. Perhaps you want to go out in the afternoon, so you press 181, and a brightly colored weather map appears on the screen. But the weather is terrible so you decide to go shopping and dial 162 for a list of the week's best bargains. But should you drive or take the train ? To answer the question you only have to press 189 for the traffic report. It's very simple to use. But probably the best thing about the service is that it's being updated all the time. Journalists type new material directly onto the screen and whole pages of the magazine can be replaced in minutes. London has already had three services. One, transmitted by ITV, is called ORACLE, while the other two, on BBC, are called CEEFAX, because they let you see facts. Although CEEFAX and ORACLE have been operating for some time, they have not been well publicized. BBC engineers do not think that their idea will ever replace books and newspapers because they can be taken with you everywhere. But many people agree that this is a breakthrough as great as the invention of printing, which could change not just our reading habits but our whole way of life.

But after forty days without a fish the boy's patents had told him that the old man was now bad luck, and ordered the boy to join another boat, which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his boat empty and he always went down to help him carry in the fishing lines or take down the old, patched sail.

I remember the tail of a huge fish slapping against the boat, the noise of you clubbing him and the sweet blood smell. I remember everything from when we first went together,"" the boy said.

Which is the wrong way to learn math well?	Dear Mary, I'm sorry to hear that you didn't get good grades in math mid-term exam. And you said you spend a lot of time studying math. However, it is difficult for you to learn it well. I think you should find a right way to learn it. Here is my advice for you. During the class * Listen to the teacher and be sure to write down everything the teacher puts on the blackboard. * If you don't understand a step or how to get the answer to the question, ask the teacher or a classmate for help right now. * Underline key points while taking notes. After the class * Recopy each day's notes into a new notebook clearly. * Do your homework every day carefully. And don't copy other students' homework. * If a step is unclear or you don't know how to do it, ask for help soon. _ * Look for useful examples of how this kind of difficult problem is used in your textbook or other materials Before exam * Review all of your notes quickly and find out every missing problem at times. * Work examples in the text each several times until you can do them quickly. This will help you improve the speed needed for the exam. If you do as I said, I think you will get good grades in the final exam. Come on! Mary.	"[""You should copy other students' homework.""]"
Here are the good reasons for people to take holidays in autumn except that _ .	"September can be a depressing month. The summer holidays are over, it's time to go back to work or school and Christmas is four months away. However, for some people it's the perfect time to get away. These days more and more people are taking their holidays late in the year and for good reasons. Holidays in autumn can be cheaper, the resorts are less crowded and the weather isn't as extreme as it is in the summer. So, where are the best places to go? Here are our top tips. Sardinia (in Italy) has an average temperature of 27degC in September. It also has ""Autunno in Barbagia"" (Autumn in Barbagia) a series of festivals that take place in 27 villages in Barbagia, a mountainous region of inland Sardinia. The festivals continue from September to December, so there's always something happening. There are street markets, craft workshops and there's lots of eating and drinking (This is Italy, after all). Dubrovnik Croatia has become very popular in summer but it's quieter and more pleasant once the crowds have left. The weather is still warm but less humid. You can take a ferry to the popular beaches on the islands of Sunj and enjoy it with locals. Dahab Egypt, is extremely hot in the summer with temperatures up to 38degC. However, the autumn is cooler while the sea is still warm. This makes Dahab the perfect place for snorkeling and windsurfing. There are also interesting historical sites to visit such as the Coloured Canyon, with its dramatic rock formations, and St Catherine's Monastery, at the foot of Mount Sinai. Kas is a relaxed fishing village on the Lycian coast in southern Turkey. There are plenty of things to do and the temperature has dropped (so you can actually enjoy doing them!) Kas is a good place to stay if you want to walk part of the Lycian way: a long-distance footpath that stretches for 500km from Fethiye to Antalya through the ancient land of Lycia. There are also watersports, of course. The best time to go diving is supposed to be after the first rains of autumn (usually between late September and early October) when the fish become most active. Marrakech Morocco is another good destination. The city itself is a fascinating place to spend a few days. When you have had enough of that, go to Tigmi, a beautiful hill town about 20 kilometers away. There's a hammam (a Turkish bath) and a large heated pool, which makes it the perfect place to relax. Wherever you go this autumn - have fun!"	['the scenery in autumn is more attractive']
Why Mrs. Higgins's face became a frightened and broken one?	"The drug store was closing for the night. Young Alfred Higgins, the shop-assistant, was ready to go home. Mr. Carr, the boss, stared at him and said: ""Stop! Alfred. Maybe you'd be good enough to take the things out of your pockets and leave them here before you go."" Alfred's face got red. After a little hesitation , he took out what he had stolen. Mr. Carr said, ""Maybe I should call you mother and let her know I'm going to have to put you in prison."" Alfred thought his mother would come rushing in, eyes burning with anger. But, to his surprise, she arrived wearing a smile. ""Hello, I'm Alfred's mother. Is he in trouble?"" she said. Mr. Carr was surprised, too. He had expected Alfred's mother to come in nervously, shaking with fear, asking with wet eyes for a mercy for her son. Yet, she was most calm, quiet, and pleasant, which made Mr. Carr feel guilty . Soon Mr. Carr was shaking his head in agreement with what she was saying. ""Of course"", he said, ""I don't want to be cruel. You are right. Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up."" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, ""You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed."" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again."	['Mrs. Higgins was sad and disappointed at what his son had done.']

What was strange about the author's schedule?	"I had a very good teacher named Leon Sultan .I liked him very much. Mr. Sultan had just got a job at my high school but his name wasn't in the school's system. So when I got my schedule ,it read: Staff F. It was during _ hat I realised that ""Staff F"" was Mr. Sultan. When he called my name, he asked if I remembered him. Then I realised that he was the teacher who had taught me English when I was in primary school. Mr. Sultan was a very special teacher. Even though he was older and had been to college, but he was Still ready to learn from others. He would listen to your opinion carefully before expressing his opinion. I think what he taught me more than anything else is to have an open mind Another thing I couldn't forget was his teaching method -group work There were four members in the group. Each group had its own topic. Everyone in the group would play a certain role. One would keep the discussion moving, the other one would write down the thoughts of the group, another one would be responsible for gathering information, and another one would share everything the group had discovered with the rest of the class. This allowed us to become ""experts"" on one topic and teach the rest of our classmates. Now ,I have become a more open-minded boy. That is because of my two and a half years in Mr. Sultan's class."

According to Weir's performance, we can conclude that _ .	"There are good Santas and there are bad Santas. The good Santas all realize one thing: In the mind of a child, Santa Claus is perfect. That's difficult. And so they come from around the world to attend the Charles W. Howard School in Midland, Mich. The school offers a three-day, 40-hour course for Santas hoping to be excellent. A former Macy's Santa named Charles Howard founded the Michigan school in 1937. ""Many people will think if you have a suit and you're a Santa,"" said Tom Valent, the school's current dean. ""It's more than that."" The school teaches everything from breathing techniques for carol singing to the beard maintenance. There are lessons in child psychology, sign language and even media training for talk-show appearances and call-in shows. Santas also need to make sure they know all the names of the reindeer . What's harder to deal with, however, is children who ask for Christmas gifts like bringing daddy home or making mommy happy again. After spending time in the classroom, Weir went to the mall to test his training. However, at one point, his hat fell off, and he was unsure how to react. ""You're the real Santa,"" Valent said. ""Pick that hat up, slip it back on, keep smiling and do your job. You've got to stay on top of your game. Even the last one at night, when you're tired, you've got to remember: This one's forever, so do a good job."""	['Weir was short of experience']

Why does the government plan to end the one-child policy?	"The government in China plans to end its one-child policy and let families have two children instead. The plan was announced on Thursday after high -level political meetings in Beijing. A Chinese Communist Party statement gave a number of reasons for the change in policy. The statement said the change is meant to balance population development, stop a falling birth rate and strengthen the country's labor force . China, with the largest population in the world, started the one -child policy in 1980. But the government allowed only a small number of couples to have two children. For example, some families in the countryside could have two children, if the first-born child is a girl. In 2013, the Chinese government gave other couples a chance to have two children if one of them was an only child. Jiang Quanbao, a teacher and population expert, explained how Chinese families react to the newest policy. ""Too many young people in the cities are no longer interested in having a second child,"" he said. ""People in the countryside are more interested. But some of them are already allowed to have two children. "" At the end of 2014, China had a population of 1.37 billion people. A total of 800 million of them have jobs. But the labor market population will drop in 35 years. That is to say, the country will be in great need of labor by the year 2050. With the two-child policy, an increase in births can solve this problem. Boys and girls, what do you think of the two-child policy? Do you want to have a new-born brother or a sister?"

Which of the following is NOT true about the 1830's and 1840's (line 24)	The work of railroad pioneers in America became the basis for a great surge of railroad building halfway though the nineteenth century that linked the nation together as never before. Railroads eventually became the nation's number one transportation system, and remained so until the construction of the interstate highway system halfway through the twentieth century. They were of great importance stimulating economic expansion,but their influence reached beyond the economy and was strong in American society at large. By 1804, English as American inventors had experimented with steam engines for moving land vehicles. In 1820,John Stevens ran a locomotive and cars around in a circular track on his New Jersey estate,which the public saw as amusing toy. And in 1825, after opening a short length of track, the Stockton to Darlington Railroad in England became the first line to carry general traffic. American businesspeople, especially those in the Atlanic coastal region who looked for better communication with the West, quickly became interested in the English experiment. The first company in America to begin actual operations was the Baltimore and Ohio,wich opened a thirteen-mile length of track in 1830. It used a team of horses to pull a trainof passenger carriages and freight wagons along the track. Steam locomotive power didn't come into regular service until two years later. However, for the first decade or more, there was not yet a true railroad system. Even the longest of the lines was ly short in the 1830's, and most of them served simply to connect water routes to each other, not to link one railroad to another. Even when two lines did connect, the tracks often differed in width, so cars from one line couldn't fit onto tracks of the next line. Schedules were unreliable and wrecks were frequent. Significantly, however, some important developments during the 1830's and 1840's included the introduction of heavier iron rails, more flexible and powerful locomotives, and passenger cars were redesigned to become more stable, comfortable, and larger. By the end of 1830 only 23 miles of track had been laid in the country. But by 1936, more than 1,000 miles of track had been laid in eleven States, and within the decade, almost 3,000 miles had been constructed. By that early age, the United States had already surpassed Great Britain in railroad construction, and particularly from the mid-1860's, the late nineteenth century belonged to the railroads.

The author mentioned the occasion when almost all the staff were ill to _ .	"On my first day of work at Moro Assurance, I arrived nervously, totally wet and nearly half an hour late. I had forgotten to take an umbrella, had missed the bus and was mow ready for a good scolding . It was then that I met Nicky Jonathan, the Managing Director. She was a small, birdlike woman. Her appearance gave others the impression of a nervous, easily-flustered person. I soon learnt, however, that her true character was calm, warm and kind, yet very professional. After reminding me that lateness would not be tolerated in the office, she laughingly admitted to me that she had been over an hour late in her first morning because she had lost her way, which was typical of her. After a wet, awful morning, this kind office manager led me to my seat; yet her kindness and super ability didn't stop surprising me there. During the years I worked with her, my admiration for Nicky steadily increased. Her ability to deal with several matters at once seemed almost miraculous . I remembered one occasion when nearly everyone in the office had gone down with the flu, yet Nicky managed to keep the office running smoothly without seeming stressed. The most striking thing about Nicky was her understanding towards others. _ If she sensed that something was wrong, she would call you into her office and encourage you to talk. Not only was she a good listener, but the advice she offered was always sound as well. All in all, Nicky is the most admirable person I've ever mer. I will always remember her as the ""guiding light"" in my working life."	['show that Nicky was very capable']

Tom looked around but there was no place for him to sit. He walked into the station cafe . he looked up at the clock there. It was only twenty to twelve. He found a seat and sat down before a large mirror on the wall. Just then, Mike, one of Tom's workmates came in and sat with Tom. ""What time is your bus?"" asked Mike. ""There's plenty of time yet,"" answered Tom. ""Well, I'll get you some more tea then,"" said Mike. They talked while drinking. Then Tom looked at the clock again. ""Oh! It's going backward !"" he cried. ""A few minutes ago it was twenty to twelve and now it's half past eleven."" ""You're looking at the clock in the mirror."" said Mike. Tom was so sad . The next bus was not to leave for another hour. Since then Tom has never liked mirrors. ,."	['Half past twelve.']
We can infer from the passage that the boy _ .	"People say teenagers are no good. They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive carelessly up and down America's main streets. And at least some of the time those things are true. But we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too. I watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral which happened in a church. A teenage grandson stepped forward. Softly he began:""I want to share a few values that Nana taught me. She never failed to see light in any situation. When our family dog would attack her, what would Nana say? Oh, what beautiful markings that dog has."" That was Nana. ""She was a strong woman who often lived in the shadow of my grandpa, who was a successful businessman in this city. But she was the one behind the scenes who provided the strength and support for Grandpa's career,"" he said, with a voice now trembling. ""That was Nana's way."" Finally, in a voice breaking free of sorrow, he looked up and said, ""Nana taught me courage. She put up a fight to the end, when she died peacefully, which is how she lived her life. That was Nana's way, and I hope I can carry on in the same manner."" There are no hearts as sensitive as those of teenagers, because everything is happening to them for the first time. The trouble with teenagers is that they haven't learned to be controlled. When that boy rose to speak about the woman who had been his dearest friend, his honest voice dragged each of us out into the open where we could no longer hide. I was moved and learned a lot."

The passage tells us that with the development of cars, we may _ .	"Imagine a world where air pollution is no longer a problem. Clean air is all around us. People don't have to worry about polluting the air every time they drive their cars. They no longer need to face the problem of not having enough fuel either. Although scientists have been trying for many years to develop a new kind of car that does not need gasoline , _ have been unsuccessful. Recently, however, car engineers have succeeded in creating a new kind of car that runs on gasoline and electricity . This is the famous ""hybrid car"". This car gets its name from the fact that it has a gasoline engine and an electric motor inside. Hybrid cars do not pollute the environment as much as the cars that are commonly used today. They also cost drivers less money because they need less fuel than ordinary cars. Hybrid cars are becoming widely popular in the United States. They are soon expected to become widely used around the world. If scientists and engineers continue to work on car development, perhaps the world with clean air that we imagined earlier just might become real in the future."	['live in the world with clean air']
Ebola causes the death of a human being by _ .	The current Ebola outbreak in western and central Africa has infected at least 3,069 people, including 1,552 dead, making it the largest outbreak in history. Ebola is a deadly virus --about 60 percent of people infected with it have died. How is Ebola doing its harm? When a person becomes infected with Ebola, the virus damages the body's immune cells, which defend against infection, said a researcher at Lancaster University. But if a person's immune system can stand up to this attack, then he is more likely to survive the disease. The patients that survive it best are those who don't get such a bad disadvantage in immune system. But if the body isn't able to get rid of this attack, then the immune system becomes less able to regulate itself. This means the immune system is more likely to run out of control, leading to a drop in blood pressure, multi-organ failure and eventually death. What are the common symptoms of the disease? Fever. Headache. Joint and muscle aches. Weakness. Diarrhea. Vomiting. Stomach pain. Lack of appetite. Chills. Rash. Redness in the eyes. Hiccups. Cough. Sore throat. Chest pain. Difficult breathing or swallowing. Bleeding inside and outside of the body. How to prevent the spread of Ebola? Ebola can be spread primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and fluids of an infected patient. We should avoid contact with infected patients and objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles used by them. Avoid areas where infections have been reported. For now, the disease has only been confirmed in central and West Africa, four cases in America and Europe. Avoid eating wild-caught bush meat. Researchers have suspected that the disease came to humans via animals, probably through the meat of primates . If you're in an area where the disease has been reported, avoid purchasing, eating, or handling wild game to stay on the safe side. Wear protective medical clothing if you're around infected patients. Extreme caution is necessary. Hospital workers must use masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, which needed to be worn at all times if you're around infected patients. How Do People Survive Ebola? Doctors don't know for certain who will survive Ebola, and there is no specific treatment or cure for the disease. Although in the minority, some people do recover from infection. Our suggestions include: Maintain your electrolytes and body liquid. Sports drinks can be used. Monitor your blood pressure and control it if necessary. Dropping blood pressure may be a serious sign of infection. Breathe in an oxygen-rich environment. Quickly address any symptoms of infection. Be honest about when and where you're feeling pain.

What is the best title for this text?	"I clearly remember the day when my little brother was born: January 1, 1994. One of my favorite family photos shows me lying with my mother in the hospital bed, happy but un-aware of the small, sleeping baby in the background. I stayed with my grandparents for the weekend of my brother's birth, excited about my new brother but not yet aware of what having a little brother would mean. I didn't truly realize what was going on until we were in the hospital room at Duke University---- coincidentally , the same room in which I had been born two years earlier. When I looked at my brother for the first time, I felt a mixture of fear and interest. Little did know that small, pink creature would grow up to be one of my favorite people in the world. In reality, though I am two years older than my brother, I am more often than not the real baby in the family. I am very lacking when it comes to common sense. Instructions constantly confuse me and I frequently find myself totally puzzled by things like knowing how to start the washing machine or manage the storage settings on my iPhone. That's where Gibson comes in. The poor kid has had to guide me through more tasks than I would care to admit, but he never complains. Though I should probably be told to figure it out myself, he always comes through. I'm envious of his ability to readily answer the ever-present, ""What do you want to do with your life?"" question at family gatherings. ""Be a doctor,"" he says----a solid answer, completely opposite to my shaky one, ""Well, I'm an English major, so..."" My brother truly is my best friend. No one understands me better, and there isn't anyone else I would want to be stuck with in our family. I may not have a clear idea of where I'm headed, but he is stuck with me."

Why shouldn't drivers put their dogs in the car while driving?	"High heels, coffee cups and dogs have been regarded as three of the most dangerous things to have in a car. The seemingly harmless items have been responsible for more than 13 million crashes and near misses on Britain's roads. While men were responsible for the greater number of accidents reported, women played their part by driving in high heels. Putting fashion over function meant 44 percent of female motorists had been prevented from using the pedals correctly by their high heels--with those aged 25 to 34 accounting for most of the incidents reported. Those keen for a caffeine kick while driving can also create an accident if they leave empty coffee cups lying around their vehicle. Twenty percent of those surveyed admitted they had crashed their car or had a near miss after a deserted coffee cup or empty drink bottle rolled under their brake pedal . However, it is not just wearing and eating that cause a threat from inside the car, man's best friend could also cause a catastrophe if not safely secured. One in eight motorists claimed to have had a scrape or near miss on the road due to their dog's wandering freely, climbing into the front seat or trying to escape through the windows. The accidents meant drivers took their eyes off the road for more than three seconds each time, according to the poll of 2,000 British motorists. The survey has found drivers will pick up an average bill of PS261.47 for the damage caused by every crash. Londoners were the most at risk of an accident closely followed by motorists in the West Midland and Wales. Janet Connor, a managing director, said many accidents could be avoided if people cleaned their cars regularly, as one in ten drivers involved in crashes admitted to driving inside a mountain of debris. She said, ""The possible dangers and distractions outside the car are well known but as the evidence suggests, those within the car are often forgotten."""

Coston can't sleep well on Saturday nights because _ .	"On Saturday nights, A.J.Coston doesn't get a lot of sleep. Usually three or four times a night, a loud bell rings, a red light flashes, and he has to jump out of his bed. That's because he's a weekend volunteer firefighter with Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Station 13 in Northern Virginia. During the week, he lives at home with his mom, dad and sister and does his main job which is going to high school. ""I have always wanted to get into firefighting since I was a little kid watching fire trucks go by,"" he says.

_ is really moving forward when you look at the wave.	As we all know, the ocean moves. But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action.	['Wave energy']
Which of the following is the main reason for Ma Yan's Diary to be published?	"Ma Yan is not really a writer. But this 15-year-old girl has written a book that has moved many people around the world. ""Ma Yan's Diary"" tells us about Ma's life. She lives in a poor village called Zhangjiashu in Tongxin, Ningxia, and she has no money to go to school. But she is brave and has a strong desire to go to school. Her mother gave her diary to a French reporter, Pierre Haski when he went to Zhangjisshu in 2001. Now, it has been published in France Italy, Germany, Japan and China. Ma is now a Junior Three student at Yuwang Middle School in Tongxin. Before this, she had to leave school twice. When she had to stop going to school the first time, her mum told her there was no money for her to go to school. She worked for 21 days and saved 13 yuan. With this money, she went back to school. The second time, her family told her she had to leave school but her two brothers could stay. ""I want to study,"" Ma wrote in her diary. ""Why can boys study but girls can't? It would be wonderful if I could stay at school forever."" Ma loves school so much because she wants to have a better life. ""My parents work hard in the fields but they are still poor. They have no knowledge. Most girls in my village leave school early and get married young. I don't want that kind of life,"" Ma said. After her story became known, many French student sent money to her. Ma's dream is the same as ever. She hopes to go to Tsinghua University and become a reporter. ""Then , I can find poor kids like me and help them, "" she said."	['Her diary was read by a French reporter.']
What will we have if we get a flu?	If you don't keep yourself warm enough, winter can be a time of illness. During the winter months, people easily get colds and flu . Many think they are the same, but these two illnesses are different. Colds can stay with you for up to a week. You will have a running nose, sore throat, headache, cough and a fever. Flu is more serious. You will feel sick very quickly. You will have a fever and a headache. Your body will hurt and become weak. This could last for up to four weeks. Is there any way to keep yourself away from colds and flu? Staying clear of people with colds or flu may work. Try not to touch your nose or eyes if you have been close to someone who has a cold. Wash your hands, especially after cleaning your nose. Going out with wet hair can also give you a cold! If you catch a cold or flu, go to bed and rest. Doing this will help you get better. Drink lots of water. Stay in a warm, well-aired room. If you have a headache, or your muscles hurt, take some medicine.	['Body hurts, a fever, a headache']
From the whole text, we can see that Jim feels _ .	"Nowadays with the development of agriculture, farmers use more technology. However, they are being told more needs to be done to stop them injuring at work. One in five British workplace deaths happens in agriculture even though farmers are only a small part of the working population. During the year 2012/13 there were 1,061 injuries in total and it is thought many more go unreported. Jim Chapman from Warwickshire had his arm torn off by farm machinery seven years ago when he was 23. ""You don't realize how much you rely on your second arm until it's gone,"" he said. He fell against a PTO shaft , a spinning metal bar at the back of a tractor. ""It catapulted me from one side of the machine to the other,"" he said. ""I landed on the floor, minus all my clothing. My left arm had been torn off."" He admits that the machinery was missing part of its proper safety guard. ""But again,"" he added, ""it was a rushed day. There were a few machines that didn't work. Also, I was getting behind with the jobs."" Over the last 10 years, other industries that you'd think of as dangerous, like building or quarrying , have lowered the number of workplace deaths and injures. In the farming industry though, deaths remain high with 34 deaths in 2012/13. Judith Hackett, the chair of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is ""not acceptable"" that the accident statistics for farming are still high. ""People in farming don't have minor injuries. When they get injured, it's bad."" She said. ""When I said to the National Farmers' Union (NFU) that if I had sons I would not want them to work in agriculture, it really made them sit up and take notice."" There's a whole host of reasons why farming is as dangerous as it is. It is a very rough industry. Also, it's often because people are left alone. They could be young and inexperienced, or older people, who would have retired maybe 5 or 10 years ago in other industries. Jim wants others to learn from his experience. ""Look at what you're doing before you go running in,"" he said. ""You could make a mistake that you'll live with for the rest of your life."""	['regretful']
After the author had a heart attack, the doctor advised him _ .	Ten years ago I used to be very fit . I rode a bike to work and I got a lot of exercise at weekends. I used to play tennis a lot and go for long walks. In those days I didn't earn very much. I had a job in an office. It wasn't a very good job but I had a lot of time to do the things I enjoyed doing. Then, about eight years ago, I got a much better job. The pay was better, but the hours were a lot longer. I bought a car and drove to work every day. I began to take people out to lunch. And I began to put on weight, too. I stopped playing tennis and going for long walks at weekends because I just didn't have any time for things like that any more. There's a lot of stress in my job. Perhaps that's why I started drinking more than I used to. For example, I used to have only half a glass of whisky when I got home, but then I started filling my glass to the top, and instead of having one glass, I would have several. I started smoking a lot, too. I never used to smoke at all. Two months ago I had a heart attack. At first I just couldn't believe it. Luckily it wasn't very serious. The doctor advised me to stop smoking and to eat less. He also advised me to work less and get more exercise. But I just haven't any time! My job takes everything out of me! Sometimes I wonder if I should get another job. Perhaps I could do something like I used to do. But if I do that, I won't earn as much. I have a family to support. I have to think of them, too. I just don't know what I should do. What do you think?	['to stop smoking and take exercise']
We learn from the passage that _ .	"More than 2.25 billion cups of coffee are drunk throughout the world each day, and it's likely that many taste bitter. Now, a new study suggests that coffee fans can make their drink sweeter by changing the color of their cups. Researchers from Oxford set out to prove whether the claim that coffee drunk from a white cup tastes biter was true. They used 36 volunteers and three different colored cups---blue, white and transparent glass--- to examine the claim. In one experiment, the white cup increased the intensity of the coffee taste relative to the transparent cup. Then, in a second experiment, coffee drunk from the white cup was found to taste less sweet when compared to the other colored cups, while the blue cup made the coffee taste the sweetest. The scientists believe that the color brown may be associated with bitterness, and coffee in a white cup appears the brownest. ""Our study clearly shows that the color of a cup does influence our sense of the coffee taste,"" leading author Dr George Doorn, wrote in an article for The Conversation. ""The effect of the color of the cup on the taste of the coffee reported here suggests that cafe owners should carefully consider the color of their cups,"" he said. ""The potential effects may spell the difference between a one-time purchase and a return customer."" Actually, the idea that color can change the food and drink taste came out many years ago. A study published last year reported that red, strawberry-flavored cake served on a white plate was rated as 10 percent sweeter than the same food presented on a black plate."

From the passage we know that _ .	Everyone likes living in a clean and comfortable environment. If the environment are bad, it will affect our body, and make us not feel well. Sometimes we may be terribly ill. At that time we don't want to work, and we have to stay in bed and rest at home. So the environment is very important to us. It's germs that makes us ill. There are germs everywhere, They are very small and you can't find them with your own eyes, but you can see them with a microscope They are very small and there may be hundreds of them on a very small thing, Germs can always be found in dirty water. When we look at dirty water under the microscope, we shall see them in it. Germs can also be found in air and dust . If you cut your finger, some of the dust from the floor may go into it, and you will have much pain in it. Sometimes the germs will go into all of your bodies, and you will have pain everywhere. To keep us healthy, we should try our best to make our environment cleaner and tidier. This needs us to work together.	['Germs may make us ill']
We learn from the reading that _ .	"Sarah ran in, shouting, ""Look what I found!"" Over the top of the paper I was reading; came a terrible thing that caused me to jump. It was a snake skin found in our garden. ""Isn't it beautiful?"" said my seven-year-old daughter. I opened my eyes widely and looked at the snake skin in fear . I didn't think it was beautiful, but I learned never to appear nonchalant with children. Everything they see for the first time is important to their sense of beauty; they see only excellence in the world. ""Why does it do this?"" Sarah asked. ""Snakes shed their skins because they need to renew themselves,"" I explained. ""Why do they need to renew themselves?"" Sarah asked. ""We often need to shed our skins, those coatings that we cover ourselves with,"" I said to my daughter. ""We leave some things and find other thing unwanted or unnecessary. This snake no longer needs this skin. It is probably too little for him, and he probably doesn't think he looks as smart in it as he once did. "" As we talked, I knew that she began to understand. Although she couldn't understand clearly, she would know that renewal is part of progress; that we need to take a good look at ourselves, our rooms, schoolwork and spirit, and see what we need to keep and what we need to leave. I was careful to tell that this is a natural way, not one to be forced. ""Snakes don't peel off their skins when they like them. ""I explained. ""It happens as a natural thing of their growth. "" ""I see, Dad,"" said Sarah as she held the snake skin, and then ran off. I hoped she would remember this; we need to throw some away because they are worthless or unnecessary. Then we can store them as memories in our deep hearts."	['the girl seemed to understand what her father said']

The purpose of helding a meeting round the restaurant to _ .	"One afternoon, four black youths walked into a restaurant that served ""whites"" only. They sat down and ordered bread and milk. The white waiter just said ""We don't serve blacks"". The young men did not move. They were tired to death of segregation and of being kicked around. The manager was called. When he saw the angry look in their eyes, he said that he was sorry, but it was not possible to serve them. The next day, more young black people came, and even more came the day after to the restaurant. Then a gang of white youths came in and attacked them. Most of the blacks were beaten up and were black and blue all over. After that the police rushed in, the several people were put in prison---all of them were black, although they had not done anything wrong---just because they were black. The news spread quickly through the black living areas in the city. A large crowd held a meeting round the restaurant the following day, forcing the restaurant to shut. Young men, black and white, made speeches protesting against segregation and pointing out that black people only wanted to live a life in the same way that whites did. They gave out leaflets and soon the movement spread to other cities. Business became so bad at that particular restaurant that the owners were forced to give and served blacks. Nowadays, all the blacks are served in all restaurants open to the public in America."	['fight for their freedom and rights']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	Patients and doctors alike have long believed in the healing power of humor.It is claimed that humor not only affects patients' moods, but can actually help them recover faster. Several studies seem to support this.Patients in better spirits are known to have higher immune cell counts.Some have even claimed to have healed themselves of serious illnesses by reading comics and watching comedies. Despite all this, many researchers are not convinced.They point out the fact that many sufferings have been known to disappear naturally, with or without a daily dose of laughter.They also say that while optimism in general does seem to be related to better health, it is hard to tell which comes first. Humor in times of stress, however, clearly makes us feel better.On one level, it takes our minds off our troubles and relaxes us.On another, it releases powerful endorphins, a chemical produced by your body that reduces pain. There are cases where the appreciation of a good joke is indeed directly related to a person's health.It can show, for example, whether a person has suffered damage to one particular area of the brain: the right frontal lobe . Scientists confirmed this by having people read jokes and asking them to choose the funniest endings from a list.Subjects with normal brains usually chose endings that were based on a relatively complex synthesis of ideas.Subjects with specifically located brain damage, however, responded only to slapstick endings, which did not depend on a particular context.When pressed, the brain-damaged subjects saw the logic in the correct endings.They simply did not find them funny. Of course, humor is largely an individual matter.Next time your friend does not get one of your jokes, there is no need to accuse him of being a lamebrain.However, you might suggest that he lighten up--for the health of it.

When someone is keeping his arms behind his back, he tries to tell you that _ .	Body language is one of the most powerful means of communication, often even more powerful than spoken language. It is said that our body movements communicate about 50 percent of what we really mean while words only express 7 percent. So, while your mouth is closed, your body is just saying. Arms. How you hold your arms shows how open and receptive you are to people you meet. If you keep your arms to the sides of your body or behind your back, this suggests you are not afraid of taking on whatever comes your way. Outgoing people generally use their arms with big movements, while quieter people keep them close to their bodies. If someone upsets you, just cross your arms to show you're unhappy! Head. When you want to appear confident, keep your head level. If you are a monitor in class, you can also take on this position when you want your words to be taken seriously. However, to be friendly in listening or speaking, you must move your head a little. Legs. Your legs tend to move around a lot more than normal when you are nervous or telling lies. If you are at interviews, try to keep them still! Posture . A good posture makes you feel better about yourself. If you are feeling down, you normally don't sit straight, with your shoulders inwards. This makes breathing more difficult, which can make you feel nervous or uncomfortable. Mouth. When you are thinking, you often purse your lips. You might also use this position to hold back an angry comment you don't wish to show. However, it will probably still be noticed, and people will know you're not pleased. Face. When you lie, you might put on a false face. But that expression would crack briefly, allowing displays of true emotions such as happiness, sadness, disgust and fear to come through.

Which of the following is not the reason for people's frustration with the government?	"Hi, everybody. Over the past couple months, most of the political headlines you've read have probably been about the government shutdown and the launch of the Affordable Care Act . And I know that many of you have rightly never been more frustrated with Washington. But if you look beyond those headlines, there are some good things happening in our economy. And that's been my top priority since the day I walked into the Oval Office. After decades in which the middle class was working harder and harder just to keep up, and a punishing recession that made it worse, we made the tough choices required not just to recover from crisis, but to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. Five years later, we have fought our way back. Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months. Another 200,000 Americans went back to work last month. The American auto industry has come back with more than 350,000 new jobs --- jobs putting out and selling the high-tech, fuel-efficient cars the world wants to buy. And they're leading the charge in a business that has added jobs for the first time since the 1990s --- a big reason why our businesses sell more goods and services ""Made in America"" than ever before. We decided to stop our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we produce more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries. We decided to fix a broken health care system. And even though the task has been rough, so far, about 500,000 Americans gain health coverage starting January 1st. And by the way, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And one more thing: since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. And that makes it easier to invest in the things that create jobs --- education, research, and so on. Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together. Think about what we could do if the few didn't hold the economy hostage every few months, or waste time on dozens of votes to _ the Affordable Care Act rather than try to help us fix it. In the weeks ahead, I'll keep talking about my plan to build a better bargain for the middle class. Good jobs. A good education. A chance to buy a home, save, and retire. And yes, the financial security of affordable health care. And I'll look for any willing partners who want to help. Because of your hard work and tough sacrifices over the past five years, we're pointed in the right direction. But we've got more work to do to keep moving that way. And as long as I'm President, I'll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. Thanks, and have a great weekend."	['Cancelling the Affordable Care Act']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"Next time you raise an eyebrow at the views of your partner, friend, sibling or colleague, remember they could be helping to make you smarter. New research shows that intelligence is not fixed but can be boosted throughout adulthood by family members, bright mates and intellectually stretching careers. The study challenges the commonly held belief that intelligence is static by the age of about 18. Current scientific consensus suggests that intelligence is controlled by genes, with environmental factors such as schooling and nutrition playing a partial role up to this age. After this point, IQ scores stabilize . But James Flynn, professor of political studies and psychology at the University of Otago in New Zealand, argues that people can ""upgrade"" their own intelligence throughout their lives. He believes intellectual stimulation from others is crucial as the ""brain seems to be rather like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets"". However, the opposite is also true - so people sharing a home or workplace with those who are intellectually challenged risk seeing their IQ levels fall as a result. He found the ""understanding quality"" of a family changes the IQs of all members, especially children. It can ""lift"" or hold back, depending on the ""gap between their brightness and that of their siblings and parents"". A bright ten-year-old with brothers and sisters of average intelligence will suffer a five to ten point IQ disadvantage, compared to a similar child with equally bright siblings. However, children with a low IQ could gain six to eight points by having brighter siblings and special educational treatment to help pull them up. Professor Flynn also concluded that although genetics and early life experiences determine about 80 percent of intelligence, the remaining 20 percent is linked to lifestyle. This means that people can raise their IQ, or allow it to fall, by ten points or more. Therefore, the best way to boost IQ level is to mix with bright friends, find an intellectually challenging job and marry someone cleverer."

Which of the following statements is TRUE?	It's hardly surprising that weather is a favorite topic for so many people around the world--it affects where we choose to live, what we wear, our moods, and perhaps even our national characteristics.Studies have shown that changeable weather can make it difficult to concentrate, cloudy skies slow down reaction, and hot,dry winds make many people badtempered. If you live in a place like Britain, where the weather seems to change daily if not hourly,you could be forgiven for thinking that the weather is random.In fact the weather is controlled by systems which move around areas of the globe.In the UK the weather depends on depressions , often called lows,and anticyclones ,also known as highs.These systems start in the Atlantic Ocean, and make their way across the British Isles from the west to the east.Highs bring sunny weather, while lows bring rain and wind.In modern times, human activities seem to be altering weather patterns.Gases produced by heavy industry change the temperature of the earth's surface,and affect cloud formation.Some researchers say that factories in Europe and North America may have been one of the causes of the droughts in Africa in the 1980s. The human race has always tried to guess the weather,especially in areas of the world where there are frequent changes.Traditional rhymes point to early attempts to identify weather patterns; popular poems include: Red sky at night, shepherd's delight;red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning. Flies will swarm before a storm. Rain before 7,clear by 11. While folk wisdom can provide a guide to help forecast weather, today's methods of prediction increasingly rely on technology.Satellites, balloons,ships, aircrafts and weather centers with sensitive monitoring equipment, send data to computers.The data is then processed, and the weather is predicted.However,even this system cannot predict weather for longer than about a week.

What do students value more according to Weissbourd's survey?	"Today's demands for measuring childhood success have chased household chores from the to-do lists of many young people. In a survey of 1,001 US adults released by Braun Research, 82% reported having regular chores growing up, but only 28% said that they require their own children to do them. ""Parents today want their kids spending time on things that can bring them success, but ironically, we've stopped doing one thing that's actually been a proven predictor of success--and that's household chores."" says Richard Rende, a developmental psychologist. Giving children household chores at an early age helps to build a lasting sense of mastery, responsibility and independence, according to research by Marty Rossmann, professor at the University of Minnesota. In 2002, Dr. Rossmann analyzed data from a longitudinal study that followed 84 children across four periods. She found that young adults who began chores at ages 3 and 4 were more likely to have good relationships with family and friends and to achieve academic and early career success, as compared with those who didn't have chores or who started them as teens. Chores also teach children how to be empathetic and responsive to others' needs, notes psychologist Richard Weissbourd. In research, his team surveyed 10,000 high-school students and asked them to rank what they treasured more: achievement, happiness or caring for others. Almost 80% chose either achievement or happiness over caring for others. As he points out, however, research suggests that personal happiness comes most reliably not from high achievement but from strong relationships. ""We're out of balance,"" says Dr. Weissbourd. A good way to start re-adjusting priorities , he suggests, is by learning to be kind and helpful at home. The next time that your child asks to skip chores to do homework, resist the urge to let him or her off the hook. Being slack about chores when they compete with school sends your child the message that grades and achievement are more important than caring about others. What may seem like small messages in the moment but add up to big ones over time."	['Achieving high achievements.']
According to the passage, if a person gets lost in the forest, at the very beginning, he would _ .	"The Pathfinder When we found him, he was a sorry sight. His clothes were torn, his hands bleeding. Before we reached him, we saw him fall. He lay a moment. Then he pulled himself to his feet, walked unsteadily a few yards through the woods and fell again. After we got him out, we went back to find the gun that he had thrown down. His tracks showed that for two days he had circled in the forest, within 200 yards of the road. His senses were so dulled by fear and tiredness that he did not hear the cars going by or see the lights at night. We found him just in time. This man, like others before him, had simply been frightened when he knew he was lost. What had been a near disaster might have turned out as only a pleasant walk, had he made a few preparations before he stepped from the highway or off a known path. Whatever sense of direction that a man may have, it's still largely a question of observation. A skilled woodsman always keeps an eye on his surroundings. He notes that the shape of a mountain, the direction water flows through a swamp, and the way a tree leans across a path. With these in mind, he may be turned around many times, but he is seldom lost. There are exceptions, of course, and once in a while a man does come across some strange problem that puts him into the ""lost"" situation. A rainstorm or sudden blizzard may catch him without a compass in his pocket. Darkness may find him in a rough area, where travel is dangerous without a light. When this happens, the normal first reaction is the fear of being laughed at as a result of his poor knowledge in the woods. He may also be concerned about the inconvenience that he will cause his friends when he doesn't show up. This false pride may lead him to keep on the move in a false effort to find his way against all difficulties. The person who thinks ahead is seldom in great danger. He'll be safe if he observes carefully, thinks ahead, and remains calm."	['worry about being laughed at']
In the Venice Carnival people wearing masks _ .	The Venice Carnival is the largest and the most important Venetian festival. It is a festival that celebrates the passage from winter to spring, a time when seemingly anything is possible, including the illusion that the people at the bottom become the most powerful by wearing masks on their faces. The Venice Carnival could date back to 1296. It was confirmed on the day before Lent, a public holiday, but it had no direct religious connection at that time. However, the participants were not allowed to wear masks around the city at night; men could not enter convents if they pretended to be women, and celebrations within the convents were strictly forbidden. People who broke the rules could be put into prison. The laws were not relaxed until the late 17thcentury, when the carnival-goers were allowed to wear masks throughout the carnival. Participants would wear a white mask in old days, while costumes have become even wilder today. St. Mark's Square is the center for the carnival, while Campo San Polo and Sestiere are two other popular places where events take place. Most of the events are free, along with several unusual masked balls for which visitors will have to buy tickets in advance. The 2012 Venetian Carnival was celebrated from February 11 to 21. There were the liveliest celebrations of parties, performances, show, music, dances, dinner sets along streets, and hotels. It attracted a great number of visitors around the world. Many travelers booked Venice hotels and prepared costumes and masks well ahead of time so that they couldn't be made fun of by local people.	['can imagine they have great power']
What is the best title of the passage?	"In the summer of 1999, a small town called Golcuk was shaken by a big earthquake in north-western Turkey. It destroyed the whole town and other nearby places. Soon enough, help from other countries flew there for one purpose, ""saving lives"". Nowadays wherever an earthquake strikes, other countries are ready to send help. That is really something that, as human beings, we should be proud of. When the earthquake struck, I was living in my hometown of Ankara, capital of the Turkey. Despite the 220-mile distance between the two locations, we still were able to feel the shakes. I had a chance to visit Golcuk a couple times when I was a kid. My uncle who lives in Germany has a summer house there, and every summer they stay in Golcuk for their yearly vacation. After the quake struck, we couldn't contact them, so we didn't know if they were in Golcuk or in Germany during the quake. Our unsuccessful attempts worried us, and the only thing we wanted to hear was that they were OK. Without wasting any more time, my brother, my sister's husband, and I decided to drive there to check on them by ourselves. When we were driving, the damage of the earthquake started to show itself right away. Big, wide, tall trees were laid down on the side of the road. Getting closer to Golcuk, we found the impact of the earthquake was getting worse. Inside the town was total destruction. It wasn't easy to figure out the streets among the ruins. Finally, we were able to find my uncle's apartment and thank God, it was still standing, but nobody was there. Later on we found that they hadn't yet visited Golcuk that year. What luck! Earthquakes are natural disasters and there is no way to avoid them, especially as earthquakes never give a warning in advance. They just strike mercilessly in the middle of the night when people are asleep in their beds. We cannot stop disasters but we can prepare ourselves for their consequences."

Profe was a teacher of _ .	"I was late on my first day of high school. My next class, Spanish, scared me. As the second bell rang in the hallway, I ran to the door of the classroom. At the door, a hand reached out and shook mine firmly. I looked up. A man smiled and introduced himself as Profe, which means teacher or professor in Spanish. Right away, his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears. I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish. I admit I only speak a little Spanish. But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe every day. ""Everyone is worth your time. "" Profe stood outside his classroom door every day before and after class. During lunch, his room was always filled with students. He would stay after school to listen to and chat with students. He taught me that every person is special. ""Don't fear the difficulties."" One time, I ran into his class crying. My friends had _ me, and I wasn't even sure why they always left me alone. Profe told me, ""Linda, life gives you ashes . But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels. The hard stuff will help you become a better person."" I learned to look at my troubles differently because I know I'll grow in difficult times. A year ago. I visited my old high school hoping to see Profe. But he had retired. My high school helped me contact him. Now we stay in touch through e-mail. The author William Arthur Ward wrote: ""The ordinary teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher shows. The great teacher inspires. "" Thank you, Profe, for inspiring me."	['Spanish']
As mentioned in the passage, Lucy	Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today, Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away.	['needs to test more elephant groups']
Most serious infectious diseases spread mainly in _ .	"The World Health Organization and several other United Nations agencies are calling for a major new effort to fight malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. These three infectious diseases killed almost 6 million people last year. That is about 10 percent of the total number of deaths around the world last year. The WHO and UN agencies released a new report at the World Economic Forum in New York City earlier this month. The document says that deaths around the world from malaria and tuberculosis could be cut in half by the year 2010. It also says the number of deaths from AIDS could be reduced 25 percent within that same time period. The report is called ""Calling Up the Response to Infectious Diseases."" It calls for huge new investments in methods to prevent and treat infectious diseases. Officials say money is needed for research and to purchase drugs. Money is also needed to devices to prevent diseases, such as bed nets. Bed nets prevent mosquitoes that carry malaria from biting people while they sleep. David Heymann, director of the infectious disease program at the World Health Organization, says that providing effective drug treatments is important for improving peoples' health and economic well - being. Reducing disease can also help improve economic growth in developing countries. The WHO report also describes successful health programs in developing countries. In Peru, for example, the number of tuberculosis cases was cut in half by increasing the treatment to control the disease. In Vietnam, malaria was reduced 97 percent through the use of bed nets. And in Uganda, cases of the virus that causes AIDS were cut in half among pregnant women and children through the use of anti - AIDS drugs. This new international health campaign is estimated to cost about 12,000 million dollars a year. So far, officials say the campaign has about 2,000 million dollars. The WHO says the campaign will need stronger relationships among government, private aid agencies, and drug companies to succeed."	['developing countries']
What is the passage mainly about?	About fifty years ago, when television first came out, people thought that radio was no longer useful. Television has both sounds and images . It is much more real and interesting to watch television than to listen to the radio. However, fifty years later radio is still very popular and it will be here for a long time. One reason is that we don't need to see an image when we listen to the music on the radio. In fact, listening with your eyes closed is the best way to listen to a piece of music. You can imagine yourself on a sandy beach or up high on a mountain. In other words, you can create your own images. Moreover, while listening to the radio, you don't have to take your eyes off your work. For example, you can listen to the radio and drive at the same time. Or you can read a book and listen to the radio. Television, on the other hand, doesn't have this advantage. A radio is much smaller than a television. You can take a radio anywhere and turn it on anytime you want. In a quiet place you can use headphones to listen to the news or music on the radio. In this way you won't disturb anybody. Moreover, a radio is much cheaper than a television. For less than $ 20 you can buy a small radio and have fun with it.	['Radio.']
In the past, zoos kept animals in cages so that people can _ .	Years ago, as we know, zoos kept animals in cages. Cages made it easy for visitors to see the animals, but a small cage is not a good place for an animal to live in. Today animals live in open areas. There are usually plants and a little lake around, like the animals' habitats. Visitors usually stay in the bus to see the animals outside. Zoos help to protect all kinds of animals. They protect animals in the zoo as well as animals in the wild. How do they do this? Zoos tell people how animals live in the wild and how to help protect their environment. The number of many kinds of plants and animals is becoming smaller and smaller. Mammoths, which are related with Asia elephants, are now extinct(.Scientists say that 74 different kinds of living things are disappearing a day! Zoos are working together to help animals-our friends.	['see them better']
What do child psychologists think is harmful to the feelings of children?	Japanese students work very hard, but many are unhappy. They feel heavy pressure from their parents to do well in school. Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have a wonderful life. Though this may be a good idea for those very smart students, it can have terrible results for many students because they are not talented enough. As it is reported, a number of students killed themselves. Others try to get the feelings of taking drugs . Some join the groups of troublemakers and turn to crime . Many of them have tried very hard at school but have failed in the exams and have their parents lose hopes. Such students felt that they are hated by everyone else they meet and they don't want to go to school any longer. It is surprising that though most Japanese parents are worried about their children, they do not help them in any ways .Many parents feel that they are not able to help their children and it is the teachers' work to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to those school opening in the evenings and on weekends-- they only help students to pass exams and never teach students any real sense of the world. It is a great surprise that almost three quarters of middle school students have been to such kind of schools. Many Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the students' hair to their clothes and the things in their bags. Child psychologists now think that such strict rules are harmful to the feelings of the students. Almost 40% of the students said that no one had taught them how to get on with others, how to tell right from wrong, how to show love for others, even for their parents.

What kind of sound does he find pleasant ?	A few minutes ago , walking back from lunch , I started to cross the street when I heard the sound of a coin dropping . It wasn't much but , as I turned , my eyes caught the heads of several other people turning too . A woman had dropped what appeared to be a dime . The tinkling sound of a coin dropping on sidewalk is an attention-getter . It can be nothing more than a penny . Whatever the coin is , no one ignores the sound of it . It got me thinking about sounds again . We are surrounded by so many sounds that attract the most attention . People in prefix = st1 /New York Cityseldom turn to look when a fire engine, a police car or an ambulance comes screaming along the street . When I'm in New York, I'm a New Yorker . I don't turn either . Like the natives . I hardly hear a siren there . At home in my little town in Connecticut, it's different . The distant loud noise of a police car , an emergency vehicle or a fire siren brings me to my feet if I'm seated and brings me to the window if I'm in bed . It's the quietest sounds that have most effect on us , not the loudest . In the middle of the night , I can hear a dripping tap a hundred yards away through three closed doors . I've been hearing little creaking noises and sounds which my imagination turns into footsteps in the middle of the night for twenty-five years in our house . How come I never hear those sounds in the daytime ? I'm quite clear in my mind what the good sounds are and what the bad sounds are . I've turned against whistling , for instance . I used to think of it as the mark of a happy worker but lately I've been connecting the whistler with a nervous person making noises . The tapping , tapping ,tapping of my typewriter as the keys hit the paper is a lovely sound to me . I often like the sound of what I write better than the looks of it .

Where do we write down our English names?	"I will never forget my first English class. It is very interesting. It's the first class in the morning. The teacher goes into the classroom with a smile on his face. At the beginning, he makes a self-introduction . And he tells us that his English name is John. Then he asks all of us to think of English names for ourselves. We are very excited to find a good name. Then he asks us to write our names down on a piece of paper. I think about my English name for a long time. Then I come up with a beautiful name ---Shirley. All the students write their names down and give the paper to the teacher. When the teacher calls ""Shirley"" to answer his question, three girls stand up at the same time."	['On the paper.']
What makes most icebergs white?	What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt. Scientists are still studying all the ways icebergs affect sea life.	['Tiny bubbles of air.']
For students going to London for the first time, which of the following provides the most reliable information?	Below is a housing guide for students going to London. University accommodation offices Many university accommodation offices have their own list of registered landlords . Others also provide information on accommodation agencies and other housing organizations. The advantage of using your university accommodation office is that you can get some support if you have a problem. The disadvantage is that they are unlikely to have enough registered landlords to houses all their students. Property papers: Loot and Renting Loot is an important source of information about private housing for co-renters. The offers are from private landlords, agencies and individuals looking for other co-renters. They also have a website: www.loot.com. The advantage of using Loot is that there are some excellent bargains. The disadvantage is that there is no quality control over the offers. Renting is another useful paper. The offers in this paper are mainly from accommodation agencies. Their website is at www.renting.co.uk. Accommodation agencies The majority of rented accommodation in London is probably advertised through accommodation agencies. The advantage of using accommodation agencies is that: you will have access to a large number of accommodations. A good agent will listen to your requirements and can save you time in looking for the right accommodation. The disadvantage is that they will make a range of charges to potential renters. Noticeboards Around the universities you will find a number of noticeboards where offers of accommodation will be posted. These will either be from landlords or from students. Some universities will also have online noticeboards where students can advertise to other students. Advertisements from students can be an excellent way to find accommodation. However, advertisements from landlords can be problematic. Word of mouth Some of the best housing in London is never advertised but is passed on from one group of students to another by word of mouth. It might be that you can find out about good offers from final year students. However, don't suppose that just because you have found out about housing from a friend it is necessarily going to be better than that found through any other source. Family Faced with the very high rents charged in London, some students and their parents will consider buying as an alternative. In some cases this might be a good choice.

What did the author's classmates think about his report?	"Proudly reading my words, I glanced around the room, only to find my classmates with big smiles on their faces and tears in their eyes. Confused, I glanced toward my stone-faced teacher. Having no choice, I slowly raised the report I had worked on, hoping to hide myself. ""What could be causing everyone to act this way?"" Quickly, I flashed back to the day Miss Lancelot gave me the task. This was the first real task I received in my new school. It seemed simple: go on the Internet and find information about a man named George Washington. Since my idea of history came from an ancient teacher in my home country, I had never heard of that name before. As I searched for the name of this fellow, it became obvious that there were two people with the same name who looked completely different! One invented hundreds of uses for peanuts, while the other led army across America. I stared at the screen, wondering which one my teacher meant. I called my grandfather for a golden piece of advice: flip a coin. Heads--the commander, and tails--the peanuts guy. Ah! Tails, my report would be about the great man who invented peanut butter, George Washington Carver.Weeks later, standing before this unfriendly mass, I was totally lost. Oh well, I lowered the paper and sat down at my desk, burning to find out what I had done wrong. As a classmate began his report, it all became clear, ""My report is on George Washington, the man who started the American Revolution."" The whole world became quiet! How could I know that she meant that George Washington? Obviously, my grade was terrible. Heartbroken but fearless, I decided to turn this around. I talked to Miss Lancelot, but she insisted: No re-dos; no new grade. I felt that the punishment was not justified, and I believed I deserved a second chance. At last, I worked very hard for the rest of the school year. Ten months later, that chance came as I found myself sitting in the headmaster's office with my grandfather, now having a completely different conversation. I smiled and flashed back to the embarrassing moment at the beginning of the year as the headmaster informed me of my chance to skip the sixth grade. Justice is sweet!"	['Funny.']
What is the passage mainly about ?	"A peer is a person who is about the same age as you. Peers affect your life, whether you know it or not, just by spending time with you. Peers can have a good effect on one another. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book and now everyone's reading it. However, sometimes peers affect one another in another way. For example, one kid in school might try to get another to cut class with him, your soccer friend might try to persuade you to be mean to another player and never pass her the ball, or a kid in the neighborhood might want you to with him. Some kids give in to peer pressure because they want to be liked, to fit in, or because they worry that other kids may make fun of them if they don't go along with the group. Others may go along because they are curious to try something new that others are doing. The idea that "" everyone's doing it"" may influence some kids to leave their better judgments or their common senses behind. Peer pressure can be extremely strong and hard to get rid of. Experiments have shown how peer pressure can influence someone to change her/ his mind from what she/ he knows for sure is a correct answer to the incorrect answer----just because everyone else gives the incorrect answer! That holds true for people of any age in peer pressure situations. It can be hard to walk away from peer pressure, but it can be done. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. Inner strength and self- confidence can help you stand firm, walk away and resist doing something when you know better."	['Peer pressure']
"We always use words like "" _ "" to begin the writing."	"Do you know how to write an English letter? It is different from the Chinese letter.

Then we can begin the letter at the left corner. We always use words like ""Dear sir"", ""Dear Mr/Miss/Mrs ...""to begin the writing. At the end of the letter, we usually use expressions as ""Yours"", ""Yours ever"" or ""Yours sincerely"". Then sign the writer's name. It is also different to write an English envelope.

In the author's mind, her mother is _ .	"In the kitchen of my mother's houses there has always been a wooden stand with a small notepad and a hole for a pencil. I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother. Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely the original one. ""I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years."" I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. ""You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?"" My mother replies a little sharply. ""It works perfectly well. I've always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days."" Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, ""One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on."" This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards. Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics. Those symbols have travelled unaffected through fifty years, rooted in the soil of a cheap wooden breadboard, invisible exhibits at every meal."	['keen on her research']
In the writer's opinion, _ .	From Monday until Friday most people are busy working or studying, but in the evenings and on weekends they are free to relax and enjoy themselves. Some watch TV or go to the movies; others take part in sports. It depends on _ interests. There are many different ways to spend our spare time. Almost everyone has some kinds of hobbies. It may be anything from collecting stamps to making model airplanes. Some hobbies are very expensive, but others don't cost anything at all. Some collections are worth a lot of money; others are valuable only to their owners. I know a man who has a coin collection worth several thousand dollars. A short time ago he bought a rare fifty-cent piece worth $250! He was very happy about his buying and thought the price was reasonable . On the other hand, my youngest brother collects matchboxes. He has almost 600 of them but I doubt if they are worth any money. However, to my brother they are very valuable. Nothing makes him happier than to find a new matchbox for his collection. That's what a hobby means, I guess. It is something we like to do in our spare time simply for the fun of it. The value in dollars is not important, but the pleasure it gives us is.	"[""some hobbies don't cost anything""]"
According to the passage, we know that _ .	"Drinking a lot of water does not do any good to the body, according to two experts in the United States. In fact, they warn, drinking too much water could be, in certain cases, harmful. In a study, Dr Stanly Goldfarb and Dr Dan Negoianu, both of the Renal, Electrolyte and Hypertension Division at the University of Pensylvania, the United States, have denied the popular belief that drinking a lot of water clears body toxins better, improves skin, and helps reduce weight. Dr Goldfarb and Dr Negoianu say that they found little proof to back the public opinion that drinking 8 glasses of water every day benefits health. At the same time, they fond little proof of harm in drinking 8 glasses of water every day. It is widely believed that in some cases-such as athletes, people who live in hot, dry environments, and those with certain medical conditions-drinking a lot of water indeed helps, but no studies have been done to prove the benefits of this practice in average, healthy people, the website medheadlines.com reports. The study at the University of Pennsylvania also examined reports that some people experienced increased headaches when their consumption of water was low. In one small study, which the doctors reviewed, the group drinking the most water reported fewer headaches than the control group, ""but the difference in the number of headaches was o small between the two groups as to be considered unimportant."" The researchers concluded that there is no scientific proof to support that average, healthy people need to drink at least 8 glasses of water each each day. The website medheadines.com says that, according to an Indian doctor, drinking too much water is harmful. If water enters the body more quickly than it can be removed, problems can occur."

What can we learn from the passage?	Mexico City sits on an inland plateau surrounded by volcanic peaks, which makes air quality a constant concern for people who live here. In April, the country took a decisive step toward improving air quality by enacting a temporary ban on private and federal vehicles in the city. The rule forbids people from driving in the city one day each week and one Saturday each month. Electric vehicles, government service vehicles, public transport options and school buses are not included in the ban. Mexico City isn't the first urban centre to be involved in car-free living. But the ban is more than an awareness-raiser; it was enacted with the direct aim of solving air pollution. In March, the city sank into a deep brown haze of smog when pollution levels passed the 200 mark. The city ordered some 1.1m of the area's 4.7m cars off the streets and also offered free bus and subway rides. Mexico City's temporary vehicle ban raises questions about the best ways to improve urban air quality. India, whose citizens breathe some of the world's dirtiest air, has tried a variety of solutions. Earlier this year, the Indian government started a 4% sales tax on new-car purchases. Beijing also has experience with cleaning the air. The city introduced alternate-day rules in advance of the 2008 Olympic Games, which produced good, if short-lived, results.

The charge has had a measurable effect on air quality. For now, Mexico City--named by the United Nations as the most polluted city on the planet in 1992--can look forward to the start of the region's rainy season, when daily showers will help to clean the air.

The best seats for those who need fresh air are _ .	Things Your Pilot Won't Tell You You may not be getting the airline you paid for. You may go to an airline website and buy a ticket, and get onto an airplane that has a similar name painted on it, but half the time, you're really on a regional airline.The regionals aren't held to the same safety standards as the majors: their pilots aren't required to have as much training and experience, and the public doesn't know that. --Captain at a major airline If you're a nervous flier, book a morning flight. The heating of the ground later causes bumpier air, and it's much more likely to thunderstorm in the afternoon. --Jerry Johnson , pilot, Los Angeles The smoothest place to sit is often over or near the wing. The bumpiest place to sit is in the back.If you're in the middle, you don't move as much. --Patrick Smith, pilot, and author of Cockpit Confidential Sit in the front if you want fresher air. The general flow of air in any airplane is from front to back.So if you're really concerned about breathing the freshest possible air or not getting too hot, sit as close to the front as you can.Planes are generally warmest in the back. --Tech pilot at a regional airline, Texas You never know where the safest seat is. There is no safest place to sit.In one accident, the people in the back are dead; in the next, it's the people up front. --John Nance, aviation safety analyst and retired airline captain, Seattle I've been struck by lightning twice. Most pilots have.Airplanes are built to take it.You hear a big boom and see a big flash and that's it.You're not going to fall out of the sky. --Charlotte, pilot for a regional earner,.North Carolina People don't understand why they can't use their cell phones. Well, what can happen is 12 people will decide to call someone just before landing, and I can get a false reading on my instruments saying that we are higher than we ideally are. --Jim Tilmon, retired American Airlines pilot, Phoenix	['in the front']
Why did the Obama administration start the initiative last fall?	The popular college rankings focus primarily on prestige as measured by the SAT scores of incoming students and how many applicants are turned away. An initiative started last fall by the Obama administration could help families go beyond these limited, and far too easily exploited, indexes to learn quickly and easily how a college is compared with its competitors nationally on important criteria like graduation rates, what a degree actually costs and how much debt a student can expect to run up by graduation day. If the federal government makes it legally necessary to disclose this information in a clear and consistent way, as it should, families will be better able to make informed college choices. And this will help put pressure on colleges that perform poorly to improve. Critics may regard this initiative as an example of government overreach. But given that the federal government spends nearly $190 billion a year on higher education aid to students, it has a legitimate interest in making sure that the money flows to the schools that best meet their responsibilities to families and students. Congress has taken some steps to require greater transparency from colleges. The 1990 Student Right to Know Act, for example, required colleges and universities that receive federal aid to disclose graduation rates. And the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act required schools to offer a way for consumers to determine actual costs after student aid is taken into account. But many colleges have done a poor job of obeying federal disclosure rules, and much of the available information is not in one place. The administration's new efforts would enforce reporting requirements and provide some new tools. President Obama wants to expand campus-based aid to about $10 billion from the current $2.7 billion. He has proposed moving money away from colleges that fail to control tuition increases or provide good value to others that do a better job. That is a worthy idea in principle, but he will need strong data-based evidence to determine how colleges are doing. The transparency initiatives are a good place to start and should be embraced by both parties in Congress. If students and families, facing higher tuition and rising debt, are to make sound choices, they need more and better information.	['To help parents and students make better choices of colleges.']
What do you know about CRP?	"They say that sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt you. Yet childhood bullying really can damage your long-term health. Gone are the days when bullying was considered an unavoidable and finally harmless part of growing up -- just last month we learned that childhood bullying can lead to poorer mental health even into middle age. Now William Copeland at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues have shown that it can have lasting physiological effects too. They tracked 1,420 nine-year-olds right through their teens. Each child was seen up to nine times during the study and asked about bullying. The team then measured levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in their blood. CRP is a marker of inflammation linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease and problems like diabetes. ""Because we were collecting biological samples throughout, we were able to look at CRP levels in subjects _ their bullying involvement."" says Copeland. ""This really gives us an idea of the changes bullying brings about."" Although CRP levels naturally rise in everyone during adolescence, levels were highest in children who reported suffering from bullies. Even at the ages of 19 and 21, children who had once been bullied had CRP levels about 1.4 times higher than peers who were neither wrongdoers nor victims. In a cruel twist, the bullies had the lowest levels of all, suggesting they didn't suffer the same health risks. They may even see a benefit from their behavior, though Copeland stresses it doesn't defend their actions. ""The goal would instead be to find other ways to produce this protective effect without it being at someone else's expense."" he says. Andrea Danese at King's College London has before shown that ill-treatment during childhood can lead to high levels of inflammation in adult life. ""This new study is a helpful addition in showing that these effects extend to another important childhood stressor."" he says. He suggests that care workers monitor levels of CRP in children having psychotherapy to see if it is helping to reduce the stress of being bullied."	['It is a sign of the inflammation.']
The passage may come from _ .	While all cultures share the same basic emotions, the body language used throughout different cultures of the world vary enormously. What can mean one thing in one country can often mean something completely different in another. For example, in North America and Europe people tend to prefer direct eye contact. But in some Asian countries longer eye contact is considered rude. So when communicating with people, always be aware of different cultural customs that may exist. A V sign in the US could mean victory, but in England, it stands for a rude challenge, which has the same meaning as showing the middle finger in the US. The OK gesture in America and England is given to mean everything is good or well. But in Latin America is looked on as a rude sign. The thumbs up sign in America and most of Europe means that something is good or well done, but it is considered rude in many Asian countries. Putting your feet on the table is generally not thought to be rude in America and England. However, in Thailand it is really rude. Telling someone to come to you by curling your index finger is acceptable in America and England, but this gesture signifies death in Singapore. Raising your hand up means stop in America and England. In some Asian countries this gesture is used when asking for permission to speak. In most westernized countries it is considered normal for two men to shake hands. In some Asian countries it is quite normal for men to kiss each other, while in most westernized countries men kissing in public would be viewed as homosexual behavior.

In writing the passage,the author intends to _ .	"President Abraham Lincoln often visited hospitals to talk with wounded soldiers during the Civil War.Once,Lincoln went over to the bedside of a young dying soldier. ""Is there anything I can do for you?""asked the President. The soldier obviously didn't recognize Lincoln, and with some effort he was able to whisper, ""Would you please write a letter to my mother?"" So the President carefully began writing down the soldier's words,""My dearest mother, I was badly hurt while doing my duty. I'm afraid I'm not going to recover. Don't _ too much for me, please. Kiss my sister Mary for me.May God bless you and Father."" The soldier was too weak to continue, so Lincoln signed the letter for him and added, ""Written for your son by Abraham Lincoln.""The young man asked to see the note and was astonished when he discovered who had written it.""Are you really the President?""he asked. ""Yes, I am,""replied Lincoln quietly.Then he asked if there was anything else he could do.""Would you please hold my hand?""asked the soldier.""It will help to see me through to the end."" In the quiet room, the tall gaunt President took the soldier's hand and spoke warm words of encouragement until death came."	['tell us Lincoln was great']
The main purpose of the passage is to _ .	"KFC , one of the most famous fast-food chains, saw its reputation in China shaken because of ""quick chicken"". Recent years, KFC has ever shocked us more than once because of its food safety, which made itself in severe trust crisis. Now it greatly surprised us again owing to the poultry incident. We could never believe it should have cheated us again and again. In fact, as a well-known restaurant chain, KFC's business records at China's is not very good. There's no doubt that the very incident has made things worse and worse. However, what surprised us is that although a series of misdeeds had reduced KFC's reputation, its business is increasing. What's more, KFC just made a so-called apology after what had happened, the content of which is not responsible at all for the public. As a matter of fact, this is not an ordinary chance incident. Recent years have seen so many food-safety problems in China, such as wasted oil, lean meat powder , melamine , which has done great damage to people's life. We don't know what can be eaten and how much harmful food we have eaten. Now it is not wars and natural disasters but everyday food safety that has been a great risk to human health. So what can be done to prevent our health from being damaged? To begin with, the related departments should strengthen laws to stop such illegal products from being produced. In addition, it would be a good idea to call on the media to perform its further function to monitor the businesses, factories and traders. Besides, everybody should be made aware of the risks of harmful food and only in this way can people improve their self-protection. In a word, everyone should play a role in making our food safer and better in quality. Meanwhile, the government and the related departments should take their responsibilities for people's health."

Which is NOT the writer's view?	"Being outgoing is good for your life. Those who are more outgoing like to meet lots of people and have more fun in life. In fact, being outgoing is not as hard as you think. Even shy people can be outgoing. You can start becoming outgoing with your best friend or a group of friends. But the real challenge comes when you meet strange people or new friends. Smile more, and usually they will return your smile. In this way, you may have some talks. Start a talk. Just a smile ""Hello"" or ""How is it going"" is a good start. If you want to make interesting talks, you should read news in newspapers and prepare your views, or surf the Internet for new information and then keep that in mind. The easier way to become more outgoing is to go out. This is also the most important step . Go to a park, beach, club, party or any other place that you think can be fun, and you may make new friends there."	['Being outgoing is really difficult.']
An earthquake shook San Francisco in the past because _ .	Why do earthquakes happen? Scientists explain that the outside of the earth is made of a number of different plates . For example, at San Francisco the Pacific Plate which is moving towards the northwest meets the North American Plate. The Pacific Plate is moving very slowly-at 5. 3 centimetres a year. Sometimes these two plates stop and do not move for years. Then suddenly, they jump and an earthquake is felt. As the movement of these plates, West America near the sea has always been a bad place for earthquakes. When the 1906 earthquake happened, the Pacific Plate jumped 5-6 metres to the north. We cannot stop earthquakes, but we can do things to make sure they don't destroy the whole of cities. First ,it is not a good idea to build houses along the lines, where two of the earth's plates join together. Second, if you think there may be an earthquake, it is better to build houses on rock not on sand. Third, you must make the houses as strong as possible. Weak buildings will fall down in an earthquake, but strong ones may stay up.	['San Francisco stands along between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate']
Why did the conversation soon turn into complaints?	"The conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and in life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and a variety of cups -- plastic, glass, crystal, some plain-looking, some expensive, some fine -- telling them to help themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said: ""If you noticed, all the nice-looking, expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress."" ""What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups."" ""Now consider this: Life is the coffee and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life, and do not change the quality of life. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee. So, don't let the cups drive you... enjoy the coffee instead."""	['Because life was not easy for everyone.']
Which section of a website does this passage belong to?	One person can make a difference -- purchase your copy of For America and discover simple ways to improve your life, your country, even the world. But a simple and attractive way to cut energy costs, improve air quality, and ensure public health is to grow a garden in the sky. Each time a city building is set up, the grass in that spot and trees that once reached up to the sky are replaced by a layer of asphalt or a tar roof . The lost green space can have a very real effect on a city's air temperature, air quality, and energy costs. On a summer day in most American cities, a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven . But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden? Whether it holds vegetable gardens, wildflowers, or grasses, a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees, which can reduce the building's energy costs and, if used more widely, could decrease a city's total energy costs, and improve air quality and public health. But that's not all -- green roofs are a great way to handle water management in urban areas by taking in much rainfall, provide shelters for urban wildlife, and actually extend the life of the roof itself. And green roofs also do something else: they beautify the city -- whether you're on the 3rd floor or the 30th. Now that's a brilliant achievement. The non-profit group Earth Pledge is promoting a Green Roofs Program. To learn more about a green roof, just click here: EarthPledge.com.	['Enuironment']

How did scientists find out the horses' earliest appearance millions of years ago?	"""Global warming could make humans shorter,"" warn scientists who claim to have found evidence that it caused the world's first horses to shrink nearly 50 million years ago. In fact, a team from the universities of Florida and Nebraska says it has found a link between the Earth heating up and the size of mammals - horses, in this case. The scientists used fossils to follow the evolution of horses from their earliest appearance 56 million years ago. As temperature went up,their size went down, and vice versa ;"" At one point they were as small as a house cat,"" said Dr Jonathan Bloch, curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History, which was quoted by the ""Daily Mail"" as saying. The scientists say that the current warming could have the same effect on mammals and could even make humans smaller.""Horses started out small, about the size of a small dog . What's surprising is that after they first appeared, they then became even smaller and then dramatically increased in size, and that exactly _ the global warming event, followed by cooling"" ""It had been known that mammals were small during that time and that it was warm, but we hadn't realized that temperature specifically was driving the evolution of body size,"" Dr Bloch said in the ""Science"" journal."

According to professor Lei, _ .	"SHE dresses in saggy pants and is crazy about the pop star, Rain. Bin Xue is in love with South Korean culture. The 19-year-old from Sichuan Province feels a strong connection with the neighbouring country. ""The two nations have a long history of friendship and there are many similarities between them,"" she said. ""But Koreans are iron-willed, and we could learn this quality from them."" Bin is not the only Chinese deeply affected by Korean culture. A recent survey shows that most Chinese teenagers think highly of their eastern neighbour. However, Koreans do not view the Chinese in the same good light. In a recent survey, only 5.5 per cent of Korean teens thought the Chinese people friendly. The survey among high school students in China, Japan, South Korea and the United States, was conducted in 156 high schools. More than 7,000 teenagers were questioned on success, family, their self-identity , as well as their opinions about the world at large. Results showed that most Korean teens gave a low score to the Chinese for patriotism , responsibility and honesty. In their eyes, Chinese people are not hard-working and don't obey the rules. ""The result is surprising, but it does reflect a real information gap between teenagers in the two countries,"" said Lei Li, a psychology professor from the Capital Normal University. Experts say that Chinese students' positive feelings about South Korea were a result of the booming popularity of Korean pop music. Korean movies and TV series have flooded China. And 73 per cent of the Chinese respondents said they watched Korean TV serials and cartoons. On the other hand, Lei added, Korean teenagers don't have much access to China. The survey found that only 6.7 per cent of Korean students have ever read Chinese books or news magazines or watch Chinese TV programmes.1 Professor Lei thinks that Chinese teens should give themselves a better basis for appreciating the cultures of their neighbours. It's not enough to simply enjoy their music, TV and fashion sense. ""The survey shows that Chinese teens should make friends with their foreign peers . They shouldn't judge other countries by their media alone,"" said Lei. Luo Xi'er, 17, from Hunan Province, hopes Chinese people can improve their image. ""In my opinion, it is the bad behaviour of Chinese tourists which has destroyed our image abroad,"" she said. The girl has read several online articles in which Koreans put Chinese tourists' bad manners under the spotlight. ""I would like to go to South Korea some day and show them that most Chinese are good-mannered."""	['Chinese teens should help Korean peers learn more about China']
According to the text, the author has taught English in China for _ .	"I started teaching English abroad when I was 22, soon after I graduated from university. I'm 35 now and have been doing it ever since. If you want to travel the world, there're a few ways to earn money while you do so. You can pick fruit, pull pints or teach English. The third one has definitely suited me best. I've taught in Russia, Argentina, Spain and Slovakia and stayed an average of two years in each country. Our flat is in the Sanlitun area, not far from the main football stadium, and I work at various schools in the city. The demand for the English language teachers is _ .Basically, if a Chinese person wants a job in an international company, then English is a must. In Beijing there aren't enough teachers to go round. Both the Chinese government and the business world are investing heavily in getting people to speak English. In China there's no shortage of work, though the pay can be different. If you teach English as a second language at an international school, you can earn 22,000 yuan a month, about PS2,200 or PS1,500. If you're short of cash, you can always do a bit of extra private tuition, which pays really well - about PS30 an hour. It's a bit shock the first time you find yourself in a foreign country but the training can help. And people often ask how it's possible to teach English in a country where you don't speak the local language, but there's no such thing. In China, for example, everyone knows words like ""dollar"" or ""I love you"". The best thing about Beijing is that you aren't going to be lonely. There's a huge expat community here, mostly based in Sanlitun and growing all the time. I don't know my way around Dublin or London very well, but I can tell you Beijing is the restaurant capital of the world."	['5 years']
In the writer's opinion, the characteristics of Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure are the following EXCEPT _ .	"If there's a child in your house who likes pixies , nature, or magic, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is sure to be a hit. This beautifully animated film is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone.The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's attention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship.What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised. The promising Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan.Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper, it doesn't _ itself immediately, and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering ( ), so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter ,for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration.The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass, supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead. For days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist. When Terrence accidentally breaks the Moon Stone, Tinker Bell ""explodes and sends him away.One of Tinker's more literal friends finds this extremely concerning, as she doesn't' quite understand that the outburst was emotional rather than physical - very funny indeed. After hearing the legend of the lost treasure, Tinker Bell strikes out on her own to find a new Moon Stone.She faces many difficulties and meets new friends along the way, but when Terrence comes to the rescue at Tinker's darkest hour, she realizes the value of a truly loyal friend. Though the film offers a positive message to young viewers, it's the animation that makes Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure stand out.Pixie Hollow is a charming, visually stunning world basked in lush colors.It's so lovely, so detailed, so three - dimensional that you almost want to step inside."

What we can infer from the passage is that _ .	Why read, and sometimes even write poetry? That question is not difficult to answer if we change the word poetry to songs. I sing when I feel good. When I sing my favorite songs, I feel even better. Sometimes when I am listening to music and to the song words, I feel that it was written for me. A good song always makes me feel something. There are songs that I sing in my head between classes and songs that I want to sing when the school bell rings by the end of the day. They help me get through the day. _ I like songs about love and friendship. The extraordinary thing is that my feelings are more special when I sing my favorite songs in English. I also like reading. I used to avoid poetry until an e-friend told me I should recite poems and not look up the meaning of the words. Poetry uses many difficult words and idioms, but the best thing is to just forget about them. In the beginning I felt quite strange. Now I always lock the door. Reading aloud gives you a strange feeling, but when you have some practice and fall into the rhythm, and the sounds of the words, it is really a special experience. I started with small poems, but now I think I most like long poems. I have different feelings with different poems. When I have had a bad day at school, I read Keats and forget everything. When I am sad I read Wordsworth by the light of a candle. When the poem is finished, I close the book and my sadness is gone.	['songs and poems can help get over bad emotions']

The passage is probably taken from _ .	"FIVE Americans _ the three Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine last week. It was the first American sweep of the Nobel science prizes since 1983. It's rare for Americans not to receive any of the science prizes, especially in recent years. In 2004, seven Americans were among the 10 laureates for the science prizes. Last year, the figure was five out of 10. The huge sums of money invested in scientific research is one factor that has helped many Americans to win awards. Another reason is the vast number of researchers working in the US. American universities also often have a more ""creative university environment""where people can focus on research for a long period without any pressure, said Anders Liljas, member of the Nobel Committee. New hope for AIDS patients? AMERICAN scientists Craig Mello (top) of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Andrew Fire (above) of Stanford University School of Medicine won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine last Monday. Their discovery is a process that researchers hope to use to silence disease-causing genes . It offers new ways for disease treatment. Scientists now hope to develop a new technique that could be used to treat diseases, such as cancers, AIDS and Parkinson's disease. Like father, like son? AS the son of a Nobel Prize winning professor, Roger D. Kornberg (left) had a lot to live up to. But, nearly half a century after his father, won his award, Kornberg, 59, a Stanford University professor, won his own last Wednesday: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His research into how cells read their genes is very important. It could help lead to the development of new drugs to fight cancer , heart disease and other illnesses, experts said. First light of the universe TWO Americans won the Nobel Prize in Physics last Tuesday for measuring the oldest light in the heavens.

What does the writer suggest you do if your friend makes a mistake?	Many people often lose their friends and they don't know how to keep a long friendship. So how can you keep a long friendship? The following passage explains very well about this matter. The first thing you need to do is to become a good listener. In this way, you show your friends that you are interested in their lives. You want to know more about them and you want to help them solve their problems. They will cherish the friendship more if they know you care about them. The next thing is that you should respect other people's privacy. People usually don't like others to know about their private life, so you should show respect toward their privacy. Sometimes, they need some suggestions from others, but this does not mean that others can know about their entire life. So respect for privacy is a must for keeping a long friendship. The third important thing is that you need to be able to forgive. You must remember that nobody is perfect in this world. It is important to forgive others not to blame them for the mistakes they have already made. You are not perfect either. Thus you need to apologize to others for the mistakes you may have made. Pay attention to the three things above, and you will be able to have long friendship.	['Forgive him.']
What does this passage mainly talk about?	"Confucius said, ""In a group of three people, there is always something I can learn. Choose to follow the strengths of others, and use their shortcomings to reflect upon ourselves."" As you can see from what Confucius said, everyone that we come across can teach us something useful. As long as we reflect on the lessons learnt from and by other people, we can continuously improve ourselves. But take note that when you reflect on these lessons, you apply some wisdom to each lesson because each situation is unique although they share some common principles. We can learn a lot from everyone. We always tend to think that we can only learn from those who are higher in status or have more knowledge than us, but that is not really the case. We learn from those who are lower in status than us as well, because the experience and knowledge of each person is very different. The best thing about _ learning, reflecting other people's strengths and shortcomings onto ourselves, is that we do not pay for the mistakes that are made. The only cost to us is the time that is needed to learn about and reflect on these lessons from other people's lives. As we all know, some mistakes can be ones which people cannot afford to make, for instance, a broken friendship or a financial loss. Thus constantly using other people's strengths and shortcomings to reflect upon ourselves makes us realize the costs of these mistakes and reduces the possibility that we will make similar mistakes. What can we do now to learn from others? By keeping our eyes and ears open. Be observant and able to realize what strengths and shortcomings other people have. A lot of people in this world like to complain about their lives. Listen to them and make you own assessment and from your own assessment, reflect upon your life and make improvements where necessary."

What's the best title of the passage?	BEIJING,Feb.5,2013(Xinhua)-Chinese health authorities on Tuesday launched a campaign to fight against assisted reproductive technology (ART:) abuse.Unauthorized ART use,surrogate motherhood and the illegal collection and supply of sperm and eggs,as well as the illegal sale and abuse of ovulation induction medicine,will be targeted. The Ministry of Health and health department of the People's Liberation Army General Logistics Department jointly announced the campaign at a conference.Both departments also ordered all of their local branches to _ permits for new organizations that wish to offer ART treatments.That is,new organizations will not appear recently.Official figures showed that at the end of 2012,China had 358 organizations authorized to conduct ART treatment. The health ministry also delivered a brief statement of the country's current infertility rate and ART use.The infertility rate in China is now between 7 and 10 percent,the ministry said.Some 70 to 80 percent of women who are suffering from infertility can be pregnant after changing their lifestyles and receiving medical treatment.Around 20 percent of infertile couples have to resort to ART to have babies.In 2011,about 350,000 people received ART treatment and more than 60,000 infertile couples successfully had children with the help of ART,the ministry said.

If there is an English exam two weeks later, you should go over English _ for days before that.	"Most of us seem to reach our peak of alertness around noon. Soon after that, alertness declines, and sleepiness may set in by mid-afternoon. Your short-term memory is best during the morning--in fact, about 15 percent more efficient than at any other time of day. So, students, take notice: when you are faced with a morning exam, _ to review your notes right before the test is given. However, long-term memory is different. Afternoon is the best time for learning materials that you want to recall days, weeks or months later. Politicians, business executives or others who must learn speeches would be smart to do their memorizing during that time of day. You should try to do most of your studying in the afternoon, rather than late at night. Many students believe they memorize better while burning the midnight oil because their short-term recall is better during the early hours of the morning than in the afternoon. But short-term memory won't help them much several days later, when they face the exam. By contrast, we tend to do best on tasks related to the process of knowing, understanding, and learning numbers during the morning hours. What about sports? During afternoon and early evening, you're able to react the quickest to an outside stimulus--like a baseball speeding toward you. Studies have also shown that late in the day, when your body temperature is peaking, you will consider PE easier and less tiring--whether it actually is or not. That means you are more likely to work harder during a late afternoon or early evening workout, and therefore benefit more from it. In fact, all of your senses--taste, sight, hearing, touch and smell--may be at their keenest during late afternoon and early evening. That could be why dinner usually tastes better to us than breakfast. While all of us follow the same general pattern of ups and downs, the exact timing varies from person to person. It all depends on how your ""biological"" day is structured. Each of us can increase our knowledge about our individual rhythms. Learn how to listen to the inner beats of your body; let them set the pace of your day. You will live a healthier and happier life."	['in the afternoon']
JustShareIt wants to make itself more attractive by _ .	"Americans love their cars. There are more than eight cars for every 10 Americans, but most of the time, they sit idle , parked in a driveway or on the street. Now, several companies on the U. S. West Coast are helping people rent their personal car to someone else when they don't need it. Eric Loebel is one of those people. For a small price, he wants to let his Oregon neighbors ""borrow"" his car. It's a dark blue, model year 2000 Volvo car. The sales and marketing consultant says he doesn't use it much. ""My wife and I are huge bike commuters and almost don't need a car,"" he says. Loebel is one of the first car owners in Portland to list his wheels for rent through a so-called ""peer-to-peer car sharing"" service called Getaround. Com. ""Cars are so expensive to own,"" he says ""This can definitely offset some of the cost."" The website lets car owners decide for themselves how much to charge borrowers to rent by the hour, day or week. Person-to-person rentals began in Germany a decade ago, and there are a handful of similar companies in Europe and Australia. The concept caught on quickly in California over the past year according to John Atcheson, vice president of Getaround, one of four carsharing startups in the San Francisco area. ""We have had amazing cars leaping into our system,"" Atcheson says. ""Not just 1995 pickup trucks but we have had late model Mercedes, Audis, any type of car you can imagine. We actually have a Tesla Roadster--a $150,000 sports car."" Another service called JustShareIt plans to stand out by going beyond cars. Its founder says the company will offer person-to-person rentals of power boats, jet skis and snowmobeles( ) too."	['offering other things for rent']
As to energy use, the new research from UKERC stresses the importance of _ .	"The behavior of a building's users may be at least as important as its design when it comes to energy use, according to new research from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). The UK promises to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, part of which will be achieved by all new homes being zero carbon by 2016. But this report shows that sustainable building design on its own--though extremely important--is not enough to achieve such reductions: the behavior of the people using the building has to change too. The study suggests that the ways that people use and live in their homes have been largely ignored by existing efforts to improve energy efficiency, _ instead focus on architectural and technological developments. ""Technology is going to assist but it is not going to do everything,""explains Katy Janda, a UKERC senior researcher, ""consumption patterns of building users can defeat the most careful design."" In other words, old habits die hard, even in the best designed eco home. Another part of the problem is information. Households and bill payers don't have the knowledge they need to change their energy use habits. Without specific information, it's hard to estimate the costs and benefits of making different choices. Feedback facilities, like smart meters and energy monitors, could help bridge this information gap by helping people see how changing their behavior directly affects their energy use; some studies have shown that households can achieve up to 15 percent energy savings using smart meters. Social science research has added a further dimension, suggesting that individuals' behavior in the home can be personal and cannot be predicted--whether people throw open their windows rather than turn down the thermostat , for example. Janda argues that education is the key. She calls for a focused program to teach people about buildings and their own behavior in them."	['the behavior of building users']
Which of the following is NOT the purpose of the bike rental scheme?	"London started its first major bike hire scheme on July 30th. Transport For London (TFL), the agency responsible for moving people around England's capital, put 5,000 bicycles in 400 different places around the city. The idea is to cut traffic, reduce pollution and provide a greener way of getting around London's streets. The scheme had a few small problems on its first day as people could not lock the bikes properly once they had finished riding them. As a gesture of goodwill, London Mayor Boris Johnson announced all rentals on the first day would be free of charge. The bikes are available for free for the first 30 minutes but costs go up sharply since then. Renters have to pay $1.60 for the first hour and $78 for 24 hours. The bikes are clearly designed for very short trips. TFL says it sees a ""cycle revolution"" happening in London. It predicts there will be around 40,000 new cycle journeys every day on the rental bikes. Mr. Johnson says he wants to see a return to the turn of the 20th century, when 20 per cent of journeys in London were made by bicycle. The scheme has received a lot of positive feedback in the first two days. Many Londoners believe it is a great alternative to London's overcrowded and overpriced trains and buses. One person, Andy Clark, told the Reuters news agency, ""It's a great idea. I've seen it operating in Paris and Barcelona and thought why don't we have one?"" The Londonist Blog said the bikes were very strong and were ""designed to bear a beating from both careless cyclists and drunken people""."	['To make the city beautiful.']
"The best title for this passage is "" _ ""."	"Three friends, Tom, David and John, came to New York for their holiday. They stayed in a very large hotel. Their room was on the 45thfloor. In the evening, the three men went to the cinema and came back to the hotel very late. ""I'm very sorry,"" said the man of the hotel, ""but our lifts do not work tonight.

But I know how to make it easier. On the way to our room, I'll tell you some jokes. Then you, David, will sing us some songs. Then you, John, will tell us some stories, all right?"" So they began to walk upstairs. Tom told them many jokes. David sang them some songs. At last they came to the 34thfloor. They were tired and had a rest. ""Well,"" said Tom. ""Now it's your turn, John. After all these jokes and songs, tell us a long and interesting story with a sad ending. "" ""OK, I'll tell a sad story,"" said John, ""It's not long but very sad.

How did the author feel at the beginning of his experiment?	"Earthquake in Japan.Donald Trump is accused of planting story about actress's height after she rejected him. Mexico arrests ex-police chief in case of 43 missing students. Do you really need to know all these things? Three years ago, I began an experiment. I stopped reading all newspapers and magazines. Televisions and radios were rejected. I deleted the news apps from my iPhone. I didn't touch a single free newspaper and deliberately looked the other way when someone tried to offer me any such reading material. The first weeks were hard. Very hard! I was constantly afraid of missing something. But after a while, I had a new understanding. The result after three years: clearer thoughts, more valuable ideas, better decisions, and much more time. And the best thing? I haven't missed anything important. A dozen reasons exist to _ . Here are the top three: First, our brain reacts differently to different types of information. Shocking, people-based, fast-changing details all appeal to us. News producers capitalize on this. The result: Everything complex, abstract, and profound must be systematically singled out, even though such stories are much more relevant to our lives and to our understanding of the world. As a result, we walk around with a misrepresented mental map of the risks and threats we actually face. Second, news is irrelevant. In the past year, you have probably consumed about ten thousand pieces of news. Be very honest: Name one of them, just one that helped you make a better decision--for your life, your career, or your business--compared with not having this piece of news. No one I have asked has been able to name more than two useful news stories--out of ten thousand. News organizations claim that their information gives you a competitive advantage. Too many fall for this. If news really helped people advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid. Third, news is a waste of time. An average human being spends half a day each week reading about current affairs. This is a huge loss of productivity. Take the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai. Let's say a billion people viewed the minute-by-minute updates and listened to the chatter of a few ""experts"" and ""commentators."" Thus our conservative calculation: One billion people multiplied by an hour's distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. News wasted around two thousand lives--ten times more than the attack. I would predict that turning your back on news will benefit you as much as removing any of the other ninety-eight errors we have covered in the pages of this book. Read long background articles and books. Nothing beats books for understanding the world."	['He was in constant fear.']

It's time for us to learn a lot more about fire, especially what to do if we are caught in a fire: 1. Shout out If you smell smoke or see fire, shout out ""Fire!""

What will the current economic crisis eventually do to some married couples?	"In times of economic crisis. Americans turn to their families for support. If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate. But this won't necessarily represent. an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same. We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses, By 1932. when nearly one-quarter of the workforce was unemployed, the divorce rate had declined by around 25% from 1929 But this doesn't mean people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn't afford to divorce. They feared neither spouse could manage alone. Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households, Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes. After financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities, A 1940 book. The Unemployed Man and His Family, described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job ""with tireless search for work.""He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do. The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale . For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold. Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment. Today's economic crisis could well generate a similar number of couples whose relationships have been irreparably ruined. So it's only when the economy is healthy again that we'll begin to see just how many broken families have been created."	['It will irreparably damage their relationship']
What do most school directors see as a possible disadvantage for pupils?	"How to deal successfully with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift.Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their children's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are specially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school--especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity.Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction.They aim to provide an environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory.They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms,sometimes with a teacher.The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths,basic sciences and languages.All five British specialist schools are independent,classes are small by normal school standards,with a high teacher/pupil ratio .Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders,leaving home to live,eat and sleep fulltime at school. What are the disadvantages?An obvious problem is the cost;the fees are high(PS12,000PS17,000 a year for boarders).However,each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance,to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees.Secondly,not all parents want to send their children to boarding school,especially at a very early age.Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment.They stress,however,that their main aim is to turn out ""rounded and wellbalanced"" individuals. There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress.Early signs of musical ability may disappear in their teenage years,while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a deep sense of failure.But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils,and offer help and advice if needed."

What was wrong with Timothy?	As a first -year teacher at a Christian school ,I was expecting my fifth grade students to be prefect , perfect in behavior , in attitude , and I even expected the home-life of each student to be nearly perfect . I found , of course , that these students were not different from the children I taught in public school .These kids had behavior problems , bad attitudes ,and some even had strikingly difficult family lives . One of my students in particular stands out in my mind .I'll call him Timothy for safety's sake. During the first day of class , I noticed that Timothy was different .Not only in physical appearance , but he also spoke strangely , as though a 35-year-old man were trapped inside his tiny , weak body .On many occasions , I heard Timothy speak of hate, how he hated his family . I observed Timohy for several months and read up on his background and searched for any clue that would lead me closer to understanding this child's strange behavior .Finally I was directed to Timothy's older brother's cheating in an exam and had taken his anger out on Timothy at home .Timothy's parents , in turn , had contacted the school, blaming them for Timothy's problems. I had written a letter to the administration asking that Timothy see a counselor . The school was in the process of contacting a counselor when Timothy was transferred to another school. His father hurried around my room collecting Timothy's things and left. That is the last we have seen or heard from Timothy. I was left with an empty desk and a broken heart. I cried for days afterwards. I felt as though I had done Timothy a _ ...I did not help him when he needed me. I still think about Timothy every day, and pray for him every morning.

What played the biggest part in the changes of the writer according to the passage?	I was an only child up until the age of eight.Every time I saw other girls playing or sharing their secrets with their sisters or brothers,I would feel sad for myself .At Christmas I found out that I was soon to be a big sister.I had no idea how I would deal with a baby in our house.The little experience I had with kids taught me that I didn't really like them.They were always making trouble. My parents set off to the hospital one evening and planned to have the rest of my family and I come to the hospital later .To this day, I don't think I have gone through a more nerve-wracking experience than sitting in the hospital's waiting room.I was sleepless all night .When I was finally allowed to see my new baby sister , I was so scared.I reached out and when I got a hold of her,I fell in love with her. For the first time,holding my sister had an effect on whom I want to be and because of her,rather than my parents' frequent requests.I have set out goals to improve my future.I want to be her role model,someone she can respect.The past two years has seemed to go by very fast.I've watched her grow older;I have seen her learn to walk and learn to talk.The fear that she held over me seems so small now. Now you can see that the family is such an important part of my life:it has influenced who I am and who I want to be in my future.	['Her parents and sister.']

How many kinds of future food are introduced in the passage?	With rising food prices, growing population and environmental problems, many people are worrying about how we will feed ourselves in the future. Don't worry. Scientists are trying to find some answers. Some scientists believe insects will become a staple of our diet. Insects provide as many nutrients as ordinary meat and a great source of protein , they also cost less to raise than cows and use less water. About 1,400 species are suitable as food for humans. Many people have already eaten insects as a part of their diet. Locusts are popular in Africa, wasps are a dish in Japan, and crickets are eaten in Thailand. The Dutch government is preparing for insect farms and has invested one million euros into research. In the future, land and fresh water will be in short supply. It is possible that people need to find a reliable food source in the ocean. Scientists have already found one at the bottom of the food chain---seaweed. It has long been a staple in Asia, and countries including Japan have huge seaweed farms. Such farms can easily work in other countries and be very successful. The great thing about seaweed is that it grows at an amazing rate. It's the fastest growing plant on earth. Scientists are also working in the lab to solve the problem of food shortage. A few years ago, European scientists successfully produced lab meat, also known as cultured meat. They grew muscle tissue using stem cells taken from cows. The experiment was funded by NASA to see if lab meat was a food astronauts could eat in space. In 20 years' time , lab meat is likely to become a popular dish of our diet. According to research, growing meat in a lab rather than slaughtering animals can greatly reduce greenhouse gases, along with energy and water use. People can also reduce fat from the meat and add nutrients.	['Three']
What does the writer feel about boys?	"What Is a Boy? Between the innocence of babyhood and the seriousness of manhood we find a delightful creature called a ""boy"". Boys come in different sizes, weights, and colors, but all boys have the same belief: to enjoy every second of every minute of every hour of every day and to fill the air with noise until the adult males send them off to bed at night. Boys are found everywhere --- on top of, under, inside of, climbing on, swinging from, running around, or jumping to. Mothers spoil them, little girls hate them, older sisters and brothers love them, and God protects them. A boy is TRUTH with dirt on its face, BEAUTY with a cut on its finger, WISDOM with chocolate in its hair, and the HOPE of the future with a snake in its pocket. When you are busy, a boy is a trouble-maker and a noise. When you want him to make a good impression, his brain turns to jelly or else he becomes a wild creature destroying the world and himself with it A boy is a mixture - he has the stomach of a horse, the digestion of stones and sand, the energy of an atomic bomb, the curiosity of a cat, the imagination of a superman, the shyness of a sweet girl, the brave nature of a bull, the violence of a firecracker , but when you ask him to make something, _ He likes ice cream, knives, saws, Christmas, comic books, woods, water (in its natural habitat), large animals, Dad, trains, Saturday mornings, and fire engines. He is not much for Sunday schools, company, schools, books without pictures, music lessons, neckties, barbers, girls, overcoats, adults, or bedtime. Nobody else is so early to rise, or so late to supper. Nobody else gets so much fun out of trees, dogs, and breezes. Nobody else can put into one pocket a rusty knife, a half eaten apple, a three-feet rope, six cents and some unknown things. A boy is a magical creature - he is your headache but when you come home at night with only destroyed pieces of your hopes and dreams, he can mend them like new with two magic words, ""Hi, Dad!"""

The best title for the passage is _ .	"The hole in the Earth's ozone layer has until now protected Antarctica from the worst effects of global warming. But scientists have warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3oC on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea level increase of up to 1.4 metres. In the past decades the western Antarctic has seen rapid ice loss as the world has warmed, but the other parts of the continent have, _ , been cooling, resulting in a 10% increase in ice in the seas around the region. This is because the hole in the ozone layer has increased cold winds in Antarctica, making much of the continent surface colder than usual. But now that the gasses that cause the ozone hole have been banned, scientists expect the hole to repair itself within the next 50 to 60 years. By then the cooling effect will have faded out and the Antarctic will face the full impact of global warming. This means an increase in average air temperatures of around 3OC and a reduction in sea ice by around a third. The biggest threat to the continent comes from warming seas. Robert Johnson, a scientist who monitors Antarctica ice sheets, said, ""The ice sheets in Antarctica are hundreds of metres thick. But once warm ocean waters start flowing underneath, the ice will begin thinning and could break up very quickly. ""Thinning ice sheets cause ice to break away from the continent and to melt even faster. Escaping ice from western Antarctica has already resulted in a 10% rise in global sea level in recent decades. Johnson believes that international action to reduce global warming is required immediately or it may be too late. ""Everything is connected - Antarctica may be a long way away but it is an important part of the Earth's system,"" said Johnson. ""It contains 90% of the world's ice, 70% of the world's fresh water and that is enough, if it melts completely, to raise sea levels by 63 metres."" Even in a worse-case situation scientists don't expect the ice to entirely disappear, but predict that, because of the melting ice sheets, average sea level rise will be around 1.4 metres higher by the end of the century."

How many brothers and sisters does the writer have?	I grew up in one of the poorest areas in Bradford. I live in a three-bedroom house with six brothers and sisters. I studied very hard . I got the best results in the history of the school. Other students would be happy with receiving such results. Their parents would give them an MP5 player as a prize or take them for a trip. What about me? In fact it made me sad. It was because my application to Imperial College London didn't pass. It is my dream to study medicine there. I know that nothing in life is easy. I won't give up. I will apply again the following year. While some students are traveling during the holiday, I am working hard. I help the doctors look after sick people in a hospital .

Which fact does the article lead you to believe?	"As late as 1800, women's only place was in the home. The idea of woman in the business world was unthinkable. Men were certain that no woman could do a good job outside her home. This was such a widely accepted idea that when the well-known Bronte sisters began writing books in 1864, they had to sign their books with men's names instead. Teaching was the first profession open to women soon after 1800. But even that was not an easy profession for women to enter because most schools and colleges were open only to men. Oberlin College in Ohio was the first college in America to accept women. Hospital nursing became respectable work for women only after Nightingale became famous. Seeing that she was not only a nurse but also a rich and well-educated woman, people began to believe it was possible for women to nurse the sick and still be ""ladies"". Miss Nightingale opened England's first training school for nurse in 1860. The invention of the typewriter in 1867 helped to bring women out of the home and into the business world. By 1900, thousands of women were working at real jobs in schools, hospitals and offices in both England and America. Some women even managed to become doctors or lawyers. The idea that women could work in the business world had been accepted."	['There are more men than women in professional jobs.']
Why did NASA fund the experiment of creating lab meat?	With rising food prices, growing population and environmental problems, many people are worrying about how we will feed ourselves in the future. Don't worry. Scientists are trying to find some answers. Some scientists believe insects will become a staple of our diet. Insects provide as many nutrients as ordinary meat and a great source of protein , they also cost less to raise than cows and use less water. About 1,400 species are suitable as food for humans. Many people have already eaten insects as a part of their diet. Locusts are popular in Africa, wasps are a dish in Japan, and crickets are eaten in Thailand. The Dutch government is preparing for insect farms and has invested one million euros into research. In the future, land and fresh water will be in short supply. It is possible that people need to find a reliable food source in the ocean. Scientists have already found one at the bottom of the food chain---seaweed. It has long been a staple in Asia, and countries including Japan have huge seaweed farms. Such farms can easily work in other countries and be very successful. The great thing about seaweed is that it grows at an amazing rate. It's the fastest growing plant on earth. Scientists are also working in the lab to solve the problem of food shortage. A few years ago, European scientists successfully produced lab meat, also known as cultured meat. They grew muscle tissue using stem cells taken from cows. The experiment was funded by NASA to see if lab meat was a food astronauts could eat in space. In 20 years' time , lab meat is likely to become a popular dish of our diet. According to research, growing meat in a lab rather than slaughtering animals can greatly reduce greenhouse gases, along with energy and water use. People can also reduce fat from the meat and add nutrients.	['Because they wanted to solve the problem of food shortage.']

Rockets without men in them have reached _ .	Scientists have always wanted to know more about the other _ in space. Years ago, they knew many facts about the moon. They knew how big it was and how far away it was from the earth. But they wanted to know more about it .They thought and thought. At last they found the only way to know more was to send men to the moon. The moon is about three hundred and eighty-four thousand kilometers away from the earth. A plane can not fly to the moon because the air reaches only 240 kilometers. Then there is no air. But something can fly even when there is no air. That is a rocket. How does a rocket fly? There is gas in the rocket. When the gas is made very hot inside the rocket, it will rush out of the end of the rocket, so it can make the rocket fly up into the sky. Rockets can fly far out into space. Rockets with men in them have already reached the moon. Some rockets without men in them have flown to other planets much farther away than the moon.

What can we learn about the woman?	"She was returning from teaching out in a small community . It was a moonless night, and a heavy snow was falling. She remembered back to when she had first started teaching out in small communities. In those days she had always picked up hitchhikers , until the day her sister told her of a friend who had been shot in the head by a hitchhiker, all because she had stopped out of kindness to help him during a storm. Her family didn't become concerned about her safety over the hitchhikers until the family heard the promise: ""No more hitchhikers!"" The snow that night was making her think back to this. Then she saw a man waving. She slowed down for him, but now as he ran toward the car in the dark she shook with fear. Yet she thought that if he was truly in need she couldn't leave him here in this storm. The stranger explained that his car was dead, and she told him to get in. They drove for an hour into the next city and she took him to a telephone booth . She waited until he had made a call.

Why did Long retire 14 years ago?	"When someone told 85-year-old Johnny Long that he was called a living legend, he replied, ""I don't know about that, but I'm living, and that's important."" Starting in 1949 as a high school band director and later as director of the Troy University band, Johnny Long became known as one of the most inspirational band directors in America. More than three hundred of his students went on to become band directors them-selves. ""I have been a band director for more than 60 years and all I know about the word band is that you spell it F-U-N,"" Long said. ""And if you change that, it's over."" Long retired 14 years ago to spend more time with his wife Mary Lynn. But his passion for bands never went away. He dreamed of forming a top-notch community band in Troy. But Troy is a small town -- with not a ton of top-notch talent. ""I didn't think it would work, I really didn't,"" Long said. Fortunately, there was one thing Johnny hadn't considered: the devotion of his former students. Now, once a week during the concert season, they drive in from all over the south and across the decades. 65-year-old Bobby Johnson was in Long's first college class. He lives in Atlanta and drives 3 hours to practice. Johnson said he does it because Long's ""such a unique character and I just admire him so much."" Many people do it for the same reason. ""He's the single biggest influence on my career."" ""He was a father figure to me. He's just a genuine person."" Long said he wanted to be remembered as a teacher. ""I think 'teacher' is the greatest word in the English language, next to 'mother'."""	['Because he hoped to spend more time with his wife.']
Which of the following can be the title for this passage ?	"An old English saying goes: Cold hands, warm heart, It is generally used to describe how a cool outlook often disguises a kind heart. However, Yale University researchers seem to disapprove of the old saying. They found how physically warm you are has a direct relation to ho how nice you are to people . To test the theory the scientists carried out two studies involving a total of 94undergrauates.For the first they gave half the unwitting participants a glass of hot or cold coffee and then asked what they thought of a stranger after a brief meeting They found that holding a hot cup of coffee led people to judge the stranger to be a ""warmer ""person, in terms of generosity and kindness, compared to a group of people who held a cup of iced coffee. In the second study the researchers had people , who thought they were evaluating a product, hold either hot pads or cold pads. Then they give the participants a choice of reward for reward for participating in the study: either a gift for a friend, or a reward for themselves. They study found that people who held the hot pad were more likely to choose the gift for a friend, and people who help the cold pads were more likely to choose the reward for themselves. ""It appears that the effect of physical temperature is not just on how we see others, it affects our own behavior as well,"" said Professor John Bargh, a psychologist who carried out the study. ""Physical warmth can make us see others as warmer people, but also causes us to be warmer -more generous and trusting -as well."" The researchers believe the effect relates to childhood when emotional warmth given by a parent was often accompanied by the physical warmth of being held or hugged."

Which of the following ideas would Ms Fraser agree with?	"Girls should take part in competitive sport to build confidence, the leader of a group of girls' schools will argue this week. Helen Fraser, director of the Girls Day School Trust (GDST), will tell the group that sport can help girls cope with failure. ""All girls and not just the sporty ones should take physical exercise"", Ms Fraser will say. Research that girls are far less active than boys is worrying, she argues. Ms Fraser will tell the group that she backs ""sport for all"". ""That's why I love it when our schools have A, B ,C and D teams and beyond"", she will say. The GDST draws on research from the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation which suggests only a quarter of girls in England meet basic levels ( )of activity each week. One in five girls do no activity at all, twice the proportion of boys, the research suggests. Ms Fraser says other research suggests that more than 80% of women business leaders played sports while growing up. She uses the examples of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, once a skater and tennis player, while the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, was in the French national swimming team. Ms Fraser says Olympic medallists like Jessica Ennis, Katherine Grainger and Nicola Adams are excellent role models for young women but says women's sport needs more money and more news reports..

"What can we learn about the ""jewel"" development Singapore's change Airport?"	"Singapore is building an airport where indoor trees, waterfalls and a 'rain vortex' sit alongside check-in queues, waiting rooms and baggage carousels . Where once sat a car park, there will soon be thousands of trees and plants across 22,000 sq metres of landscaped indoor parklands. This will be joined by a 40m-high indoor waterfall, expected to be the world's tallest. These are the plans for the new 3.5 hectare 'Jewel' development at Singapore's Changi Airport, scheduled to open in 2018; a five-storey, 134,000 square metre complex, mixing natural outdoor plants with modern airport facilities. ""The aim behind the introduction of such lush landscaping is purely to provide all visitors with a memorable experience, one where they are surrounded by nature and greenery,""says Philip Yim, Chief Executive Officer of Jewel Changi Airport Development. Promised sustainability measures include ""extensive usage of photovoltaic panels ""to produce renewable energy, as well as encouraging the use of natural lighting and a ""high efficiency"" air-conditioning system. The indoor waterfall, named the ""Rain Vortex"", will make use of special lighting effects to change at night into what is promised to be a dramatic light and sound show. ""The Rain Vortex is one example of how sustainable design plays an important role in the planning of the attraction,"" says Yim. 'In the event of a rain storm, the power of the rain water will flow naturally through the oculus. The excess rain water collected will be used for irrigation of the landscaping at Jewel.' Yim quotes the popular reputation Singapore enjoys as ""the garden city"", where greenery is recognised as an essential part of the urban landscape, an attractive image which clearly inspires Jewel's design. However, it remains to be seen whether, beyond the aesthetic appeal, Jewel can add genuine environmental things to something as un-environmental as an international airport."

What is the passage mainly about?	"Pessimistic,anxious and depressed people may have a higher risk of dementia ,US researchers reported on Thursday. A study of a group of 3,500 people showed that those who scored high for pessimism on a standardized personality test had a 30 percent increased risk of developing dementia 30 to 40 years later. Those scoring very high on both anxiety and pessimism scales had a 40 percent higher risk,the study showed. ""There appears to be a doseresponse pattern.That is,the higher the scores,the higher the risk of dementia,""Dr Yonas Geda,a neuropsychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,Minnesota who led the study,said in a statement. Geda and his colleagues looked at the medical records of 3,500 men and women who lived near the clinic between 1962 and 1965. They all took the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,a standard personality and life experience test,Geda's team told a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Miami. In 2004,the team interviewed the participants or family members. Those who scored higher for anxiety and pessimism on the test were more likely,as a group,to have developed dementia by 2004,including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. This did not mean a person who is pessimistic could assume he or she has a higher risk of developing dementia. ""One has to be cautious in interpreting a study like this,""Geda said. ""One cannot make a leap from group level data to the individual.Certainly the last thing you want to do is to say,'Well,I am a pessimist;thus,I am doomed to develop dementia 20 or 30 years later,'because this may end up becoming a selffulfilling prophecy ."" And there is NOT any specific way to prevent dementia,although many studies have shown that a healthy diet,exercise,keeping active in other ways,doing puzzles and other activities lower the risk."

The text is likely to be found in _ .	"It is a finding which is certain to be hotly discussed. According to the latest research, women are brighter than men. For the first time in IQ testing, psychologists have found that female scores have risen above those of men. Since IQ testing began a century ago, women have been as much as five points behind. But that gap has been narrowing in recent years and this year women have moved ahead, according to James Flynn, leader of the research. ""In the last 100 years the IQ scores of both men and women have risen but women's have risen faster,"" said Mr. Flynn. ""This is a result of modernity, which is making our brains adapt and raising our IQ."" One possible explanation is that women's lives have become more demanding as they multitask between raising a family and doing a job. Another is that women have a slightly higher potential intelligence than men and are only now realizing it. Mr. Flynn, who will publish his findings in a book, said more data was needed to explain the trend. ""The full effect of modernity on women is only just starting,"" he added. He compared IQ result from countries in western Europe and from the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and Estonia. These showed that in westernized countries the gap in scores between men and women had become minimal . The data for making comparison was limited and could be carried out for only a few countries. It included Australia, where male and female IQs were found to be almost the same. In New Zealand, Estonia and Argentina, women scored slightly more than men. Mr. Flynn said, ""As the world gets more complex, people are adapting."" He added, ""I suspect that the same trends are happening in Britain, although the data is too limited to be true."""

The massage is mainly about _ .	Many textbooks are not written in the kind of English that we speak every day. In fact, sometimes the reading is so difficult that it almost seems like a foreign language. In a way, it is--the language of science. You should not expect to be able to read a difficult science passage the same way you read an interesting story; you should not expect to read it easily and all at once. Instead, you may have to read it several times through, catching on the meaning of difficult words, going back over difficult sentences, and finally putting the whole thing together. Do not be discourages if the whole passage don't make sense to you at first. You need to pick it apart patiently until you can understand it. These are the steps to follow when you are reading something difficult: 1. Start to read normally until you _ a sentence that doesn't make sense to you. 2. When a sentence doesn't make sense, go back and read it again more slowly. 3. Look for any word you don't know in the sentence. Try to understand their meanings using word parts and context clues . If necessary, look them up in the dictionary. 4. Look at the next few sentences to see if they explain more about the sentence you are working on. Do not read very much farther ahead until you understand what is being said. 5. Finally, read the sentence again. Try to put it into simpler words. 6. Read through the passage once. Try to understand all the hard parts well. Then read the whole passage once more at a usual speed. This helps you to put all ides together. The stops sound a lot harder than they are. It is really just the normal way good readers understand anything that is difficult to read. After you have done the best you can this way, you should always feel free to ask for help from your teacher, if you have one.	['ways of reading science passages']
Which of the following does NOT belong to factors contributing to happiness?	"Happiness pays off, studies show.

Diener regards happiness as ""subjective wellbeing""--in other words, the person evaluates his or her own quality of life. The question to ask is, ""Is my life going well, according to the standards I choose to use?"" If the answer is ""yes"", then that person is judged to be happy. Because people evaluate their lives based on happiness, subjective wellbeing is very important. Though necessary, it is not enough for having a good life. ""Subjective wellbeing seems quite necessary for the 'good society', although it is not enough for that society because there are other things we also value and would want in such a place."" says Diener. Can subjective wellbeing be measured scientificall? Diener points out three parts contributing to happiness: pleasant emotions and moods, lack of negative emotions and moods, and satisfaction judgment, to which other factors including cheerfulness and feelings of fulfillment may be added. There is no magic formula for happiness. Diener suggests steps you can take to ensure you are as happy as you can be. Surrounding yourself with good friends and family--people who care about you and whom you care about--is a start. Joining in activities you enjoy and value is also important; whether it's work or play, keeping busy in an environment enjoyable to you will contribute much to your subjective wellbeing. In addition, a healthy outlook is necessary."	['Negative emotions.']
"What is the writer's opinion about ""No pain, no gain"" in exercising?"	There have always been a lot of commonly believed but false ideas about being fat and doing exercise. Some people believe that they can't help putting an weight as they get older, while others hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles will turn into fat. Here are some more myths. I'll never lose weight--I come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are born with, we can't blame our genes for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habit of eating too much and exercise too little. I am fat because I burn calories slowly Wrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume more energy than slim people, they also fail to realize how much they eat. Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately . Exercise is boring Wrong! Anything will become boring if you do it again and again. The key is to develop a balanced and varied program that's fun as well as progressive . If you enjoy a Sunday walk, take a different mute. If you do yoga , try a tai chi class. No pain, no gain Wrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury . You may experience mild discomfort as you begin to exercise regularly, but this is your body _ the positive changes in your lifestyle and the aches should disappear quickly. If they don't, rest and ask for medical advice.	['Exercise should be stopped if continuous pain is felt.']
According to Mr. Clarke, some good ways to save water are as follows EXCEPT _ .	"We use an average of 158 liters of water a day in Britain, for which we pay a bargain price of 28p a liter, but much of this is just cash down the drain, according to water companies. Most are campaigning to cut the amount we use. And the frontline weapon in their campaign is the water meter . They want us all to have one and one company is seeking powers to make this compulsory. The Government is anxious for us to use less water, too. Elliot Morley, the Environment Minister, says he is impressed by the savings when a meter is installed. In most homes, consumption drops by 20 percent. He also thinks consumers get a good deal from meters. He said, ""Most people would find that they would either be exactly the same or better off with water meters and it is a fairer way of paying for water."" At present, only 25% of households have meters and most of those are in East Anglia. They are installed by water companies, and households then have about PS43 added to each bill to cover the cost of installing and reading the meter. Barrie Clarke, a spokesman for Water UK, said, ""We want everyone to be more water wise--to think about the amount of water they use. But with our climate change and different weather patterns, over time it will make economic and environmental sense to think how we use water. This may mean meters."" Mr. Clarke believes the easiest way to save water is to use less in the garden. In one hour, a sprinkler uses the same amount of water as the average family of four uses in a day--about 632 liters. He said that gardeners should water in the evening so that it dose not _ in the heat of the day and that every household should have a water butt to collect rainwater for use in the garden."

Why are we humans the most developed of all living beings?	"Since the pre-historic times, man has had an urge to satisfy his needs.For food, shelter or a mate, he has always controlled the circumstances to the best of his advantages.Probably this might be the reason why we human are the most developed of all living beings on the earth, and probably also in the universe.As we climbed the steps of evolution, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking--we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of time. If you are hungry, what do you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things.So it silently began to pay attention to your needs and never let itself grow.When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading.Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to get help from reading.You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all, your ""How to?"" questions.Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but even your mind decodes it and explains it to you.The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas.The same seed if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would never have thought in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity.The larger number of books you read, your mind will open up like never before.Also this improves your speaking skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary.Within no time you start speaking English or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time. Actually, I had a problem in sped king English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly.I am still on the path of improvement.So, give food to your thoughts by reading."

When did the writer and her son usually stop at the local store?	"A few years ago, I worked at a church . Since my son was home schooling, he went with me to the church every day. Most mornings, we'd stop at a local store, and get a chocolate drink for him and a cup of coffee for me. The clerk at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer . When a customer brought cakes to the counter, any other clerk could have asked: ""Would you like some milk with those cakes?"" Instead, she asked: ""Would you like a lottery ticket with those cakes?"" She might have asked me if I wanted sugar with my coffee. But instead, she asked: ""Would you like some batteries with that coffee?"" Yes, life is what you make of it. This clerk's method of dealing with what some think is a boring job, and with the customers she met daily, made the hours in her day more enjoyable. In doing that, she also refreshed the lives of others and made them laugh. Sometimes, if my day at the church had been very tiring, we'd stop at that store before going home. We'd giggle as we left the store, the clerk's words echoing behind us. ""Would you like some shampoo with that orange juice?"""	['In the morning.']

What happened to the James when Super Storm Sandy hit the East Coast?	"Many pets got separated from their families almost two years ago, when Superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast. A New Jersey family was one of them. They lost their dog. He got away from their backyard during the storm. Chuck James said that his family searched for the brown-and-white dog named Reckless for months after the October 2012 storm. Reckless was a cute dog which brought much pleasure to the whole family, and the youngest daughter Tiffany loved him most. They played together, watched TV together, ate popcorn together and Reckless even saw Tiffany off when she headed for the kindergarten every morning. Chuck James kept searching for the lovely dog in every possible way, but no luck ""We reported him missing and called the shelters from time to time, just hoping they had him,"" James said. ""We always kept our hopes up, but finally it was time to move on."" James said the family had planned to get a new dog. The dog was to be a tenth birthday surprise for their eldest daughter, Ally. The family of five went to the Monmouth County SPCA( Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) to adopt a new animal. When James and his wife walked close to the first cage, they saw a familiar face inside. ""He was a little bigger than I remembered because they had fed him well,"" James joked. ""But then he was lying on my wife's feet and I knew it was him. It was unbelievable. I know this dog is meant to be with our family."" When SPCA officials asked if they could prove the animal was their dog, a friend sent a _ showing the family, with their dog before Sandy hit the East Coast. ""We're all so happy to have him back."" James said. The family is living in hotel while their home is being repaired. This weekend, the James went on camping trip with Reckless to celebrate the dog's return"	['Their pet dog Reckless went missing.']
Which of the following is true according to the information in the passage?	Boxing is a fist fighting sport between two matched combatants wearing padded gloves. A boxer's primary aim is to land as many blows as possible to the head and torso of the opponent, using strength and speed to dominate the contest. One of the oldest sports still practiced, boxing dates back to thousands of years ago. Today the sport is popular in many parts of the world and encompasses both amateur and professional matches. For most of the 20th century boxing attracted huge fan and media attention in the United States. Some boxing champions became legendary, larger-than-life figures, such as Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, and Muhammad Ali. Criticized to varying degrees throughout its history for its violent nature and high injury rate, boxing has somehow always managed to survive----and even thrive----as a sport. Modern boxing regulations are based upon the 12 rules set out by British boxing officials in the mid-19th century. These rules became known as the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, named after the 8th Marquess of Queensberry, John Sholto Douglas, who sponsored and published them. In addition to in-the-ring rules, modern boxing also has specific regulations regarding eligibility for the fighters themselves. The modern rules for professional and amateur boxing differ, but both types of contests are divided into time periods called rounds. In professional boxing, each round lasts three minutes; in amateur boxing, two minutes. A one-minute rest period between rounds is standard. Amateur contests consist of three rounds; professional contests may consist of up to 12 rounds. A bell is usually sounded by a timekeeper to begin and end each round. A key step in making boxing safer and more respectable was the introduction of gloves, ending brutal bare-knuckle competition. Boxing gloves are heavily padded to soften the impact of the blow and to protect the hands of the boxer. As an added protection, the hands are taped before being placed in the gloves, which are essentially huge mittens. Professional gloves usually weigh between 170 and 226g; amateur gloves average 226 to 340g.	['Boxing is a violent sport with high injury rate.']
What can be inferred from the text?	"To learn an instrument such as the violin or accordion takes years. The job opportunities for musicians are scarce and competition is fierce. Then why are more people than ever before paying a lot of good cash to get their children the best music teaching they can afford? The secret lies in the influence of music on the whole person. It has been found that learning a musical instrument actually increases a person's IQ over time. Different instruments and different trypes of music have varying effect, with classical music and the string family coming out on top, potentially increasing you IQ by up to 12 points! When is a good time to start learning music? Experts have found that even the fetus can benefit from listening to classical music. Surround yourself and your family with good music from the first. The Suzuki Piano Method teaches children from the age of 3 years piano, with two lessons per week. From preschool, children can learn to read music and play from sheet music. Progress in learning your instrument is directly proportional to the amount of practicing. Is there such a thing as an unmusical child? Shinichi Suzuki proposes that music is the native home language of all human beings and therefore nobody can be ""unmusical"". Of course there are exceptional talents, compared to which others may seem to be slower learners. Is there any benefit for adults in starting an instrument? Apart from the purely relaxing aspect, yes. Learning an instrument can earn even adults additional IQ points, and as an added benefit in improves your health by reducing your stress levels. Your social life may benefit too, if you are prepared to come out of your box and join occasions such as Ceilidhs (musical get-togethers) or arrange house concerts. It has been established that people who play instruments tend to be more emotionally balanced and more patient with themselves, others and life in general. So go ahead, sign up for that amateur orchestra, dust off your old trombone or take your first real six-string down from the attic ; get out there and play!"

If you get lost in the forest, you should _ .	If you go into the forest with your friends, stay with them. If you don't, you may get lost. What should you do if you really get lost? You should sit down and stay where you are. You mustn't try to find your friends. Let them find you. If you want your friends to find you, you need to stay in one place. You can also shout three times. Then stop. Then shout three times again. Keep up shouting. Always three times together. When people hear you, they will know you need help and where you are. If you don't think that you can get help before night comes, you should make a little house with some small trees or branches or something else. And make yourself a bed with leaves or grass. When you need some water and you have to leave your little house to look for it, don't just walk away. Leave small branches or something else on the way and then you can find your way back easily.

What is the purpose of the passage?	It's no secret that doing good makes others happy - but did you know it can make you happy as well? According to a study, people participating in meaningful activities were happier and felt that their lives had more purpose than people who only engaged in pleasure-seeking behaviors. Try giving these four things to others to start your journey to a happier and healthier lifestyle. 1. Your Time With a busy life, it can be hard to find any time to give away. However, volunteering your time has great benefits, including making new friends and connections, learning new skills and even advancing your career. According to a paper about the link between health and volunteering, volunteering is connected with lower instances of depression and reduces the risk of dying by 22 percent. 2. Your Attention Most of us think we're good listeners, but according to psychologist Paul Donoghue, most people are aware that others don't listen as well as they could. In addition, they're not fully aware that they themselves aren't listening. When practicing mindfulness meditation , you focus on what you experience in the moment and let your thoughts and emotions pass through without judgment. Did you know that giving someone your undivided attention helps you also? When done well, active listening strengthens your focus-which is a major part of good meditation. 3. Your Compassion The psychological meaning of compassion is the ability to understand another person's emotional state. Compassion differs from empathy in that those who experience compassion not only put themselves in another person's shoes, but also want to reduce that person's suffering. A brain-imaging study showed that the brain's pleasure centers are equally active when we give money to the poor as when we receive money ourselves. 4. Your Money According to an experiment, those who spend money on other people are significantly happier than those who spend the same quantity of money on themselves. Whether or not you can offer other gifts, donating money helps make real change happen. It represents time spent, compassion and careful attention to the needs of others.

Which is the best title for the passage?	"People seem to have a natural need for friends and with good reasons. Friends increase your enjoyment of life and relieve feelings of loneliness. They even can help reduce stress and improve your health. Having good friends is especially helpful when you are going through any kind of hard time such as when you are experiencing anxiety, panic attacks, or depression. When you are with good friends you feel good about yourself, and you are glad to be with them. A fiend is someone who-- l you like, respect, and trust, and who likes, respects and trusts you l doesn't always understand you, but accepts and likes you as you are, even as you grow and change l allows you the space to change, grow, make decisions, and even make mistakes l listens to you and shares with you both the good times and the bad times l respects your need for secrets, so you can tell them anything l lets you freely express your feelings and emotions without judging, teasing, or criticizing you l accepts the limitations you have put on yourself and helps you to remove them A person once said, ""Friendship is a continuing source of bonding ,releasing, and creating in yourself and with the other person. There is an emotional bond between the two people."" A good friend or supporter may or may not be the same age or the same sex as you, and may not have the same educational, cultural, or religious background, or share interests that are similar to yours. Friendships also have different depths. Some are closer to the heart and some more superficial, but they're all useful and good."	['To Be a Good Friend']
What can we infer from the passage?	Advertising gives useful information about which products to buy. But modern advertising does more than gives news about products and services. Today's advertisements, or ads, try to get consumers to buy certain brands. Writers of advertising are so skillful that they can, sometimes persuade a consumer to wear a certain kind of clothing, eat a special kind of cereal, or see a movie. Consumers might never even want a product if they did not see or hear advertisements for it. For example, you probab1y do not need the newest cereal in the supermarket. There are probably many cereal brands on your kitchen shelves. You may not have space on a shelf for another. But if you see ads about a new cereal that is your extra-tasty and has a free prize in the box, you may want it. Advertising must get attention. To be effective, it must be exciting, entertaining, or provide some pleasure. The secret of writing good advertising copy is to offer a good idea as well as a product. The idea is what the ad is really selling. One example is an ad that says eating a certain cereal will make a person do well in sports. That cereal brand may sell better if consumers think it offers strength and energy.	['Customers can easily be persuaded by advertisements.']
According to the text, at a graduation ceremony you'll most probably hear _ given by the speaker.	"One of the requirements of every graduation ceremony speaker is that they offer some advice. Well, get ready, here it comes. Soon you will be leaving the company of those who think they have all the answers -your professors, instructors and counselors-and going out into what we like to call the real world. In time you will meet up with other people who think they have all the answers. These people are called bosses. My advice is: humor them. A little later you'll meet additional people who think they have all the answers. These are called spouses . My advice is: humor them, too. And of all goes well, in a few years you will meet still another group of people who think they have all the answers. These are called children. Humor them. Life will go on, your children will grow up, go to school and someday they could be taking part in a graduation ceremony just like this one. And who knows, the speakers responsible for handing out good advice might be you. Halfway through your speech, the graduate sitting next to your daughter will lean over and ask, ""Who is that woman up there who thinks she has all the answers?"" Well, thanks to the reasonable advice you are hearing today and that I hope you will all pass on, she will be able to say, ""That is my mother. Humor her."""	['proposals']
Upon receiving their letters, the two daughters _ .	"A mother had two daughters. She loved them very much, but two girls would fight with each other from their earliest years. As they grew older, they became total strangers. They had no contact with each other when they were adults. This caused the mother great pain. Then, later, she had an idea. She decided to write a letter to them. In this letter, she told them how much she loved them, and how she wanted them to love each other in this way. She also gave them news of herself and some guidance on how to live happier lives. When the letter was ready, she wrote out one copy for each daughter, but these copies were special. Each copy contained only every second sentence of the original letter: the copy for one daughter had only the even sentences, and the other daughter's copy contained only the odd sentences. Neither contained the fullness of the mother's message. When the two daughters received their letters, they were puzzled. To understand the half-letter, they would have to put the two letters together and read them as one, which meant they must approach one another again in love and respect. But they each blamed the other for not helping them when trying to read the half-letter. For a long time, the mother waited in vain. Then one day, when the mother had almost given up hope, there was a knock at the door. There they stood, together. ""We've come home,"" they said at the same time. ""We've finally put our letters together, and we've come to say how much we love you, Mum."" Then she hugged them both, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks, and welcomed them back home."

How long does Thanksgiving Day usually last in America?	Thanksgiving Day is an American national holiday. It usually lasts four days. Americans celebrate it on the fourth Thursday of November each year. It's a time for people to give thanks to God, and it's also a time for family members to get together. Thanksgiving Day is like a warm family meeting. On the Eve of Thanksgiving, members of the family will drive and even fly home. The next day, they sit around the table, enjoying a traditional dinner together. Turkey ,sweet potatoes and a pudding are always ready for the Thanksgiving dinner. Thanksgiving Day is also a day for students to give thanks to parents and teachers who give them help and who love them very much.	['For four days.']
How many coal fires are there in the world?	"Mr. Brown first went to look at the underground-fire when he was seven. ""Through the hole in the earth you could see the orange fire, but you had to look fast because it was so hot,"" said Mr. Brown. In 1898,he saw the fire once more. Now, we can only see the smoke. The fire Mr. Brown saw is not the underground-fire. In fact ,there are 260 coal fires in the world. They are harmful and dangerous. Then how to put them out? Scientists have tried to set fire to underground coal to speed up the fires. In this way, the burning of underground coal would be soon finished."	['There are 260']
Which one of the following isn't mentioned in the passage?	"Camp memories last forever! We make sure they are unforgettable! Shadow Ridge Summer Camps offer so many exciting things for campers to do.

We should first _ when we meet a stranger in close proximity.	"It's what people who don't know each other talk about on elevators. And not about the weather at all. Chatting about the weather with strangers is about emotional comfort (,). When someone says ""Beautiful day today, isn't it?"" as you settle into that narrow elevator space, or at the bus stop, or waiting in line at the supermarket, the conversation is about feelings. The person is speaking to feel more comfortable with you and offering you a chance to feel more comfortable with him or her. Being in close proximity with strangers creates interpersonal tension. We can't help it. Tension automatically seeks resolution. What will you do? Do you notice the person now only a short distance away, or pretend not to notice? Avoidance is one strategy: never make eye contact and act as if nobody is there, even when your feelings tell you. In a supermarket checkout line you might leaf through a magazine. On elevators, we often avoid others by looking up at the floor numbers. The other strategy is to break the tension by noticing the other person. It starts with eye contact. Then we have a choice: smile, nod, make a remark or strike up a conversation. If we choose to talk, the most non-controversial subject to talk about is the weather. A remark about the weather evokes agreement and feelings of sympathy. ""What a nice day!"" shares a tiny sliver of happiness. ""I wonder if this rain will ever end."" shares the bad feelings with each other. Both ends of the mini-conversation feel a tiny bit more connected by experiencing this emotion of liking or disliking the weather at the same moment."	['make eye contact']
In order to support a balanced life style, which measure has the company NOT taken?	"McDonald's Corp, founded in 1940 with a restaurant opened by Dick and Mac McDonald, which was bothered by criticism of its fatty foods, says it will remove Supersize French fries and soft drinks by the end of the year, to please health-minded customers. McDonald's Supersize option, which includes a 7-ounce fries carton and 42-ounce fountain soda, has also been targeted by critics as contributing to a growing obesity crisis in the United States where more than half the population is considered _ . From a neighborhood restaurant established in Des Plaines, Illinois in 1955 to today, more than 30,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries worldwide, McDonald's is the largest quick service restaurant organization in the world, selling primarily variations on meals consisting of hamburgers, carbonated drinks besides French fries. As the first international fast food company, McDonald's has become a focal point in public debate about rising obesity rates and consumer responsibility. Most standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. The larger McDonald's grows, the more sensitive it becomes to negative customer understanding. According to this, McDonald's has tried to cater to varying cultural requirements, such as by customizing its menu to each country. The company, which began offering Supersize portions widely in 1994, said it is making the menu changes to ""support a balanced lifestyle"" approach that is in keeping with other recent moves to promote healthier behavior. These include a planned national launch of a Happy Meal for adults called Go Active! In the past year, it has introduced several health-oriented foods, such as entree-sized salads and healthy alternatives in children's Happy Meal, including milk and fruit. A new documentary film, called Super Size Me illustrates the negative effects of over-consumption of McDonald's food. The film has been released, but a McDonald's spokeswoman said that the menu changes are not related to any impact of the film on public awareness. McDonald's recognized that to be successful, it would have to be flexible and adapt to social changes. The company has been reducing complexity of its menu, part of a broader push to improve operations and service in its more than 13,000 US restaurants. Analysts said the change will allow McDonald's to continue its emphasis on foods with higher-quality elements and more money-earned, such as entree-sized salads and all-white-meat Chicken McNuggets."

According to the passage, Rodrigo Cruz _ .	Should people be allowed to use cellphones while driving? Alejandra Pachecho from Venezuela: No. Why not? That is because in this world some people drive very crazily. Also, most people who use cellphones to talk in the car usually pay more attention to what they are talking about than to driving. One of the reasons that I feel this way is that ny friend had a car accident while using a cellphone. He lost his life and his friends did, too. Rodrigo Cruz from Colombia: That depends. The a dvantages of using a cellphone while driving are that you can call the police if there is a car accident, call for help when somebody's car breaks down, and call when somebody needs something before arriving home or at the office. The disadvantages is that people get distracted when they are driving at the same time they are talking on a cellular phone. It can cause car accidents. Carl Khalid from Saudi Arabia: No. I would recommend if you want to use a cellphone while you're driving, pull over and take your time. You will avoid a lot of trouble. There are many advantages of using cellphones in cars. In emergencies such as accidents, a flat tire or engine problem, the cellphone is useful for calling 911 for help. Using the cellphone while driving can save time, but using it while driving can alsocause a lot of problems such as missing a red light or signs, not observing cars, or not paying attention to the speed limit. It causes a lot of problems. All these problems could cause loss of concentration. Mirna Hazim: Yes. A cellphone is helpful; it is one of the most important communication devices. For example, if you want to talk with somebody for an important reason, you can. One time when I was coming back from work at 10 o'clock at night, I had a problem with my car. It wouldn't move. I was scared to go into a store to call my brother because I didn't know the places there. I thought it could be dangerous. That night, I found out that owning a cellphone is important.

What conclusion could be drawn from the passage?	"Learning a second language can improve brain power, scientists believe. US researchers from Northwestern University say bilingualism is a form of brain training -- a mental ""work out"" that adjusts the mind finely. Speaking two languages well affects the brain and changes how the nervous system reacts to sound, lab tests showed. Experts say the experiment performed by the National Academy of Sciences provides ""biological"" evidence of this. In an attempt to prove the guess that speaking two languages is good for one's mind, the team monitored how the brain of 48 healthy student volunteers reacted to different sounds. Twenty three of these volunteers were bilingual. The scientists used special equipment to trace the pattern of brainwaves. Under quiet, laboratory conditions, the bilingual students responded in a similar way to the English-only-speaking students, who formed the control group. But the bilingual group were far superior at processing sounds even when there were a lot of people talking in the room. They were better able to focus on to the important information -- the speaker's voice -- and block out other _ noises. Prof Nina Kraus, who led the research, said: ""The bilingual's better experience with sound results in a hearing system that is highly efficient, flexible and focused in its automatic sound processing, especially in challenging or novel listening conditions."" Co-author Viorica Marian said: ""People do crossword puzzles and other activities to keep their minds sharp. But the advantages we've discovered in double language speakers come automatically simply from knowing and using two languages.'' Musicians appear to gain a similar benefit when rehearsing , say the researchers. According to some theories, being bilingual might help avoid dementia ."	['Being bilingual strengthens brain power.']

According to the passage, we can know _	"BC Social Report, August 14, 2010 Scandinavians may spend a lot of the winter in darkness but they are the happiest people in Europe, according to a study showed this month. Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of life. The survey entitled: ""No Man is an Island"" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10. Danes --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' ""Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,"" the study said. Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness. Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks. ""People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,"" she said."

From the reading we know that Father's Day comes _ .	Each year, we celebrate many holidays here in America. On January 1, we welcome the coming of a new year like many people in other countries. And we have another four holidays on the first day of a month: April Fool's Day, May Day, Friendship Day (Aug.1) and Grandparents Day (Sep. 1). The most important holiday for the young people comes in February. It is Valentine's Day. Lots of boys give red roses to girls as a present. People celebrate some holidays for their family members. We say thanks to our mother in May and celebrate Father's Day in the following month. In November many people return home for Thanksgiving Day, so the whole family can stay together. There are also some interesting holidays for children. For example, Halloween comes at the end of October. Children often play with pumpkin lanterns and put on all kinds of masks. Of course, the most important festival is Christmas. After a year of work and study, people can enjoy a long holiday, eat big meals, and visit family and friends.	['in June']
How much food did the man get?	"A little old couple walked slowly into McDonald's one cold winter evening. They were so old that they looked out of place amid the young families and young couples eating there that night. Some of the customers looked admiringly at them. You could tell what the admirers were thinking. ""Look, there is a couple who has been through a lot together, probably for 60 years or more!"" The little old man walked right up to the cash register, placed his order with no hesitation and then paid for their meal. The couple took a table near the back wall and started taking food off the tray. There was one hamburger, one order of French fries and one drink. The little old man unwrapped the plain hamburger and carefully cut it in half. He placed one half in front of his wife. Then he carefully counted out the French fries, divided them in two piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down between them. As the man began to eat his few bites of hamburger the crowd began to get restless. Again you could tell what they were thinking, ""That poor old couple. All they can afford is one meal for the two of them."" As the man began to eat his French fries one young man stood and came over to the old couple's table. He politely offered to buy another meal for the old couple to eat. The old man replied that they were just fine. They were used to sharing everything. Then the crowd noticed that the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite. She just sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking turns sipping the drink. Again the young man came over and begged them to let him buy them something to eat. This time the lady explained that, no, they were used to sharing everything together. As the little old man finished eating and was wiping his face neatly with a napkin the young man could stand it no longer. Again he came over to their table and offered to buy some food. After being politely refused again, he finally asked a question of the little old lady. ""Ma'am, why aren't you eating? You said that you share everything. What is it that you are waiting for?"" She answered, "" The teeth""."	['One hamburger, one French fries and one cup of tea']

For auditory learners, to memorize better and faster, what is the most important?	How to Memorize Things Quicker Than Other People? The following is my advice for you. Step 1: Preparation To improve your memorization, pay close attention to which environment you choose. For most people, this means choosing an area with few distractions, though some people do advance greatly by learning in public areas. Figure out what is most conducive to your learning so that you can get started. Next, start drinking some tea. I could link you to many scientific studies that confirm green tea as a natural catalyst for improving memory. Mechanically speaking, our ability to recall information comes down to the strength between neurons in our mind. The more you exercise the repetition, the stronger it is, resulting in the ability to memorize. As we get older, poisonous chemicals will damage our neurons, leading to memory loss. Green tea contains compounds, however, that block this poison and keep your brain cells working properly a lot longer. Step 2: Record what you're memorizing This is especially useful if you're trying to memorize information from a lecture. Use a tape recorder to track all of the acquired facts being spoken and listen to it. If you're trying to memorize a speech, record your reading of the speech and listen to the record. Obviously, this is most helpful for auditory learners, and it's also useful because it ensures that you're getting more context from a lecture that will help you learn the information faster. Step 3: Write everything down Before you start trying to recall everything from memory, write and re-write the information. This will help you become more familiar with what you're trying to memorize. Doing this while listening to your tape recorder can also help you keep a lot of the data. This is most useful for experiential learners. Step 4: Section your notes. Now that you have everything written down in one set of notes, separate them into sections. This is ideal for visual learners, especially if you use color1 coding to distinguish between subjects. This will help you break everything down and start classing the information being recorded in your brain. Step 5: Apply repetition to cumulative memorization For each line of text, repeat it a few times and try to recall it without looking. As you memorize each set of text, be cumulative by adding the new information to what you've just learned. This will keep everything within your short-term memory from fading. Keep doing this until you have memorized that section and you are able to recall the entire thing. Do not move on to another section until you have memorized that one completely. This is mostly visual learning, but if you are speaking aloud, then you are also applying auditory. Step 6: Teach it to someone (or yourself) The most effective method for me when I was in school was to teach the information to someone else. You can do this in a variety of ways. You can lecture the knowledge to someone sitting right in front of you (or the mirror, if you can't convince anyone to sit through it) and explain everything from your memory. If what you've learned needs to be recited word by word, then do this in front of someone as well in order to get a feel for what it will be like to recite the text to the intended audience.	"[""To record and listen to what they're to memorize.""]"
Why did Luca and his colleagues probably never receive an invitation to the island?	"When Luca first heard of the Island of Inventions, he was still very young. But its wonders sounded so incredible that they were forever burned in his memory. From that moment, he never stopped searching for clues which might lead him to the island. He read hundreds of adventure books, histories, volumes of physics and chemistry, even music. Over time, he pieced together his idea of what the Island of Inventions was like. It was a secret place, where all the great wise men of the world would meet to learn and invent together. Access to the island was totally restricted. To join, you had to have created some great invention for humanity. Only then could you receive the special invitation -- which came with directions to the island. So Luca spent his youth studying and inventing. Every new idea he got, he made it into an invention, and if there were something he didn't understand, he'd seek others to help him. Soon he met other young inventors and he told them about the Island of Inventions. They too dreamed of one day receiving an invitation letter. As years passed, the disappointment of not receiving their invitation made Luca and his friends work harder and co-operate more. They would meet in Luca's house, share their ideas and build new machines. Their inventions became known throughout the world, and improved the lives of millions. But still, no invitation came. They didn't lose heart. They continued learning and inventing every day, trying to come up with more and better ideas. Fresh young talent joined their group, as more inventors dreamed of getting to the island. One day many years later, Luca, already very old, was speaking with a brilliant young man named Roberts, who had written to him, asking him to join the group. Luca started telling the man of the wonderful Island of Inventions, and of how he was sure that some day they would receive an invitation. Surprised, the young inventor interrupted: ""You mean this place isn't the Island of Inventions? Isn't the letter you sent me the real invitation?"" It was only then that Luca realised that his dream had become true in his very own house. No island could exist which would be better than where he was now. No place of invention would be better than what he and his friends had created. Luca felt happy to know that he had always been on the island, and that his life of invention and study had been a truly happy one."	['The island was not a real place.']
Why is a special material painted on the tree ?	Trees should only be pruned when there is a good and clear reason for doing so and , he number of such reasons is small . Pruning involves the cutting away of overgrown and unwanted branches , and the inexperienced gardener can be encouraged by the thought that more damage results from doing it unnecessarily than from leaving the tree to grow in its own way . First , pruning may be done to make sure that trees have desired shape or size . The object may be to get a tree of the right height , and at the same time to help the growth of small side branches , which will thicken its appearance or give it a special shape . Secondly , pruning may be done to make the tree healthier . You may cut out diseased or dead wood , or branches that are rubbing against each other and thus cause wounds . The health of a tree may be encouraged by removing branches that are blocking up the center and so preventing the free movement of air . One result of pruning is that an open wound is left on the tree and this provides an easy entry for disease , but it is a wound that will heal . Often there is a race between the healing and the disease as to whether the tree will live or die , so that there is a period when the tree is at risk . It should be the aim of every gardener to reduce that risk of death as far as possible . It is important to make the area , which has been pruned , smooth and clean , for healing will be slowed down by roughness . You should allow the cut surface to dry for a few hours and then paint it with one of the materials available from garden shops produced especially for this purpose . Pruning is usually done in winter , for then you can see the shape of the tree clearly without interference from the leaves and also it is very unlikely that the cuts you make will bleed . If this does happen , it is , of course , impossible to paint them properly .	['To prevent disease entering a wound .']

There are few tips to help you at college: Just find the place where you will not be disturbed.Grab your reading material,note pad, pen and other necessities.Distraction is a biggest hurdle in focusing.You need to ask yourself what distracts you the most.Is it music from the neighbors,presence of someone at home, internet or anything else? Try to be aware of your weakest points and then stay away from them as much possible during your study time.The distraction may also include your friends and some other things.It is only you who can decide that what is best for you. When you are ready for studying,then arrange the reading material and decide what things you need to study first.Put maximum time on your weak and major subjects.Set aside your minor ones for few hours as you know that these are comparatively less important than the majors. Make a realistic study plan which you can follow and stick to it.There is no point of making all 8hr study schedule daily as you know that it's not possible for you.Start the preparation at least 4 weeks before the exams. While making a study plan,don't forget the breaks after every 90minutes of study.It will help your eyes to relax and focus in an effective manner.Make a checklist of small milestones and put this on your table so you can see them frequently.When you are done with one or more cross them from the list and focus on the new ones.

What is the best title for the passage?	Fashion isn't very environmentally-friendly because it makes people buy things they don't need, just because they're new. We want to take care of the environment, we don't want to pollute the air and we don't want to waste energy and resources. But we also want to be fashionable. How can we buy fashionable clothes and protect the environment? Old styles are fashionable again, so one way is to buy second-hand clothes -- recycled clothes. Another way is to buy' fair trade clothes. These clothes are either recycled or made in a ' way that protects the environment. They also protect the people who make the clothes. Surprisingly, white cotton is one of the least environmentally-friendly crops of all. To protect the cotton, the growers use chemicals that pollute water, make farm workers ill and kill wildlife. New materials, such as hemp and bamboo, grow quickly and are more environmentally-friendly. These materials are very soft, and look fantastic. The best materials are coloured using natural dyes, made from plants. Environmentally-friendly clothes are practical but until now they were often dull. Now fashion-designers are working with these materials and the clothes are beautiful as well. So now we can buy fashionable clothes that are also environmentally-friendly.

But without pain, everyday activities can be hazardous for Ashlyn. In fact, they could kill her. When Ashlyn was born, no one knew that she couldn't feel pain. But soon there was hints that something was wrong. When Ashlyn's teeth grew in, she almost chewed off part on her tongue. Ashlyn's parents took her to doctor for tests. The doctors discovered that Ashlyn couldn't feel pain, a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain(CIPA). Fewer than 100 people in the United States have it. There is no cure. . ""Sometimes it's frustrating,"" she admits. But Ashlyn doesn't let anything stop her from doing things she wants to do. ""I just have to be careful,"" she says.

What does the passage mainly talk about?	I used to live in Kobe in Japan. On my way home on the bus every evening I used to look for an old man who often played his saxophone near the river. I couldn't hear his music because the windows were closed on the bus but I imagined it to be loud and clear. I wanted to be like that man. One night I went to Himeji, a city not far from Kobe. As I walked with my family along the river I saw a statue. It was a young man who looked just like me. He was wearing a cap and smiling. Around his neck was a leather strap and in his hands was a saxophone. He was lifting the saxophone to his lips and he was just about to play. I stayed there for a long time by the statue dreaming of playing a saxophone on TV. Two weeks later it was my birthday. Imagine my joy when I opened my present from my parents and found that it was a saxophone! I put it to my lips to play, but it wouldn't make a sound. Then Dad told me to read the instruction book to find out what to do. After about 15 minutes the saxophone was ready to play. I raised it slowly to my lips as my family watched. But still there was no sound. I blew and blew but I couldn't get the saxophone to play. I was almost crying when suddenly the saxophone made the most beautiful sound--loud and clear like I imagined the music of the man by the river in Kobe. I blew again, I moved my fingers on the saxophone and I made more sounds. I was happy because I was playing very interesting sounds. But I wasn't playing music yet. Then came the lessons. Night after night, week after week my teacher made me practice. Slowly I started to improve and at last there came the magic day when I started to play music. Now I'm in the TV studio with my saxophone strapped to my neck and my cap on my head. I'm always thinking of the man by the river in Kobe and the statue smiling at me in Himeiji. I'm a happy man.

It can be concluded from Larry Rosen's research that _ .	"Phantom vibrations-the phenomenon where you think your phone is vibrating but it's not-have been around since the mobile age. Today, they're so common that researchers have devoted studies to them. For Valerie Kusler, who works on a cattle farm, the feeling is complicated by the cows""The cows'moo is very muffled, it kinda sounds like...errrr,""she says.""So that's very similar to what my phone sounds like when it vibrates on my desk or in my purse."" Other people may not confuse cows for their phones, but research shows phantom vibration symptom is a near-universal experience for people with smartphones. Nearly 90 percent of college undergraduates in a 2012 study said they felt phantom vibrations. The number was just as high for a survey of hospital workers, who reported feeling phantom vibrations on either a weekly or monthly basis. ""Something in your brain is being triggered that's different than what was triggered just a few short years ago,"" says Dr Larry Rosen, a research psychologist who studies how technology affects our minds. ""If you'd asked me 10 years ago, or maybe even five years ago if I- felt an itch beneath where my pocket of my jeans was, and asked me what I would do, I'd reach down and scratch it because it was probably a little itch caused by the neurons firing ,""he says. Now, of course, the itch triggers him to reach for his phone. Rosen says it's an example of how our devices are changing how our brains process information. ""we're seeing a lot of what looks like obsessive behavior. People who are constantly picking up their phone look like they have an obsession. They don't look much different from someone who's constantly washing their hands. I'm not saying that it is an obsession, but I'm saying that it could turn into one, very easily,"" Rosen says. While 9 out of 10 participants in the study of college students said the vibration feeling bothered them only a little or not at all, Rosen still recommends backing away from our phones every once in a while to keep our anxiety levels down. ""One of the things I'm really _ about in spite of being very pro-technology, is just away from the technology for short periods,"" Rosen says.""And by short periods. I mean; maybe just 30 minutes or an hour."""	['phantom vibrations could probably result in obsessive behavior']

In transactive memory, people _ .	"As Internet users become more dependent on the Internet to store information, are people remember less? If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how. In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood thatthe computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it. In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder . Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called ""transactive memory "". According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date. This doesn't mean we are becoming either more or less intelligent, but there is no doubt that the way we use memory is changing."	['remember how to find the information']

Perhaps he has sent you to a hospital, but all the advanced equipment there shows that there is nothing wrong with you. Then, consider this: you might be in a state of sub-health. Sub-health, also called the third state or gray state, is explained as a borderline state between health and disease. According to the investigation by the National Health Organization, over 45 percent of sub-healthy people are middle-aged or elderly. The percentage is even higher among people who work in management positions as well as students around exam-week. Symptoms include a lack of energy,depression,slow reactions,insomnia,anger,and poor memory.Other symptoms include shortness of breath,sweating and aching in the waist and legs. The key to preventing and recovering from sub-health,according to some medical experts,is to from good liwing habits,alternate work and rest,exercise regularly,and take park in open air activities. As for meals,people are advised to eat less salt and sugar.They should also eat more fresh vegetables,fruits,fish because they are rich in nutritional elements--vitamins and other elements that are important to the body.Nutrition experts point out that it is not good to eat too much at one meal because it may cause unhealthy changes in the digestive tract. They also say that a balanced diet is very helpful in avoiding sub-health.	['When you are in a state of sub-health, you should find out the reasons and relax yourself.']
How does Ellen feel about the Vendee Globe race?	"Britain's Solo Sailor Ellen MacArthur started sailing with her aunt when she was eight. She loved it so much that she saved her money for three years to buy her first small sailing boat.When she was 18,she sailed alone around Britain and won the ""Young Sailor of the Year"" award. But Ellen really became famous in 2001.Aged only 24,she was one of only two women who entered the Vendee Globe round the world solo race,which lasted 100 days.Despite many problems,she came second in the race out of 24 competitors and she was given a very warm welcome when she returned. Ambition and determination have always been a big part of Ellen's personality.When she was younger,she lived in a kind of hut for three years while she was trying to get sponsorship to compete in a transatlantic race.Then she took a one-way ticket to France,bought a tiny seven-meter Class Mini yacht,slept under it while she was repairing it,and then she raced it 4,000 kilometers across the Atlantic in 1997,alone for 33 days. Ellen has had to learn many things,because sailing single-handed means that she has to be her own captain,electrician,sail maker,engineer,doctor,journalist,cameraman and cook.She also has to be very fit,and because of the dangers of sleeping for long periods of time when she's in the middle of the ocean, she has trained herself to sleep for about 20 minutes at a time. And she needs courage.Once,in the middle of the ocean,she had to climb the mast of a boat to repair the sails at four o'clock in the morning with 100 kph winds blowing around her.It took her many hours to make the repairs.Ellen says,""I was exhausted when I came down.It's hard to describe how it feels to be up there.It's like trying to hold onto a big pole,which for me is just too big to get my arms around,with someone kicking you all the time and trying to shake you off."" But in her diary,Ellen also describes moments which make it all worthwhile: ""A beautiful sunrise started the day,with black clouds slowly lit by the bright yellow sun.I have a very strong feeling of pleasure,being out here on the ocean and having the chance to live this.I just feel lucky to be here."""

What is the best title of this passage?	It is curious that our own faults should seem so much less heinous than the faults of others. I suppose the reason is that we know all the conditions that have caused them and so manage to excuse in ourselves what we can't excuse in others. We turn our attention away from our own mistakes, and when we are forced by unexpected events to consider them, find it easy to accept them. For all I know we are right to do this; They are part of us and we must accept the good and bad in ourselves together. But when we come to judge others, it is not by ourselves as we really are that we judge them, but by an image that we have formed ourselves .To take a little instance: how scornful we are when we catch someone out telling a lie ; but who can say that he has never told not one, but a hundred? There is not much to choose between men .They are all a mix-up of greatness and littleness, of kindness and unkindness, of goodness and badness. Some have more strength of character ,or more opportunity ,and so in one direction or another give their instincts( ) freer play ,but potentially they are the same. For my part, I don't think I am any better or any worse than most people, but I know that if I set down every action in my life and every thought that has crossed my mind, the world would consider me a monster. The knowledge that these thoughts are common to all men should inspire one with tolerance to oneself as well as to others. If they enable us to look upon our fellows, even the most great and respectable, with humor, and if they lead us to take ourselves not too seriously, it is well.	['Good and Bad? Accept It!']
Some students will do little in an open classroom because _ .	Roughly speaking, teachers in traditional education may feel that students are too young to know much about the world, and have to be told what to do most of the time. By contrast, open education offers teachers quite different feelings. Students are expected to be responsible for their own education--to discover subjects by themselves instead of being made to study them. This way of teaching allows the students to grow independently and to develop their own interests in many subjects. Some students who do badly in a traditional classroom will be happier in an open classroom and enjoy learning. They will not have to worry about grades or rules at all. However, many students won't do well in an open classroom. For these students, they will do little in school if there are too few rules. They will not make good use of open education, which is so different from traditional class, because they may have a problem getting used to making so many choices on their own. For them it is important to have some rules to direct them. They may worry about the rules even when there are no rules. In addition to that, some traditional teachers do not believe in open education and do not like it either. Since both of some good points and bad points of the open education have been explained clearly, you may have your own opinion on the issue. Personally, I think that the concept of open education is good only in theory. In actual fact, it may not work very well in a real class or school. I believe, most students, but of course not all students, need some structure in their classes. They may want and need to have rules. In some cases, they must be made to study some subjects. Many students are pleased to find subjects they have to study interesting. They would not study those subjects if they did not have to.	['there are too few rules']
Something that weighs 15kg on Earth weighs about _ on Mars and _ on Jupiter.	"If you look at the night sky, you'll often see stars moving very quickly. In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high. But many believe the reason is that much of the universe is made of something called ""dark matter"". Groups of stars called galaxies, such as the Milky Way, might even be made up of 90 percent dark matter. How much something weighs depends on where it is. The same object weighs only half as much on Mars as it does on Earth and almost three times as much on Jupiter. So scientists prefer to talk about the mass of something rather than how much it weighs, because mass does not change. They can work out the mass of galaxies by measuring the distance between them and the speed they move at. Recently, Jorge Penarrubia, a senior academic at Edinburgh University, UK, and his team discovered something interesting: The mass of the Milky Way is only half as much as the mass of another nearby galaxy, Andromeda. This seems strange, and dark matter may explain why. Finding out more about dark matter could help us understand how the universe began, but this is not easy. Lots of scientists with different types of expert knowledge are working on the problem. We can't see dark matter, it's very difficult to measure and we can't find out its mass. Unlike stars, dark matter doesn't produce or reflect light. But we can make a good guess that it is there because of the way things move and the way light bends. Experts now think dark matter may be very different from the matter that we find on Earth. There may also be five times as much dark matter in the universe as ordinary matter."	['7.5 kg; 45 kg']
The big event in the writer's life _ .	I am the mother of a five-year-old girl now, but I'll never forget some of the best lessons my mother taught me. Lesson 1---Always be there for your child I can't tell you the last time my parents missed a big event in my life; it never happened. Whether it was a play, or even just a practice---my parents were always there for me. As an only child, they _ everything in my life. Lesson2---Hide in the bathroom For years I wondered why my mother had made the bathroom her own personal library and would stay there forever. Now I know it's the only place for her to have at least two minutes of peace and quiet. Well, I try to, but that's quite difficult with two cats, a dog, a kid, a husband and only one bathroom. Lesson3---Get involved I was lucky in having parents who let me do anything they think was good. Now today, I am fond of being active and involved. Whether it is a sports game or a volunteering group, or just playing with my daughter, I love to be involved. Lesson4---It's OK to fail My parents weren't perfect and that was OK. I know I'm not perfect and I hope my daughter knows that's OK. Families love one another no matter what happens. If you fail, you learn from the mistakes and keep right on going. Parents are so important to a child's growth and development and I'm so glad that I had great parents to follow.	['was never missed by her parents']
How many times did the young man try before the bird flapped its wings?	"One day, a young man visited a small farm in the countryside. As he got closer to the farm, he saw many chickens and an eagle playing together. He then went up to the farm house and talked to the farmer, ""Sir, I was just passing by and I saw that you have many chickens and an eagle."" The farmer smiled and said, ""That's not an eagle. It's a chicken."" The young man kept saying that it was an eagle. He said to the farmer, ""Sir, that is an eagle! I can proveit to you."" The farmer laughed, ""Sure, go ahead."" The young man then pulled that big bird out and climbed a high mountain. He held the bird in his hands and said, ""You are an eagle, fly!"" But the bird failed. The young man tried the second time. He said to the bird, ""I don't care you have been _ as a chicken for those years. But I know what you were created to be. You are an eagle, now fly!"" After the young man tried another three times, the bird began to flap its wings. Finally, it flew high and began to fly around the farm. It is true to us. Some people around us have continued to keep us down by lying to us. Over all of those years, we were told to be a failure, not to be good enough and to accept the ""reality"". They are wrong. We should try our best to reach our highest potential to prove that we are eagles."	['Five.']
If it takes 1 hour to cook a dish using a conventional oven, how much time will one need on average to cook the same dish using a convection oven?	Convection vs. Conventional Ovens If you are in the market for a new oven and you've already begun shopping for one, you've probably noticed that there are a few different types. Two of the most popular oven types are conventional and convection. The difference in these two types of ovens is the way in which the heat in the oven is spread during the cooking process. Convection ovens A convection oven uses a fan which is usually located on the back side of the oven. The purpose of the fan is to force the heated air inside of the oven and circulate it around the item being cooked. The heater air is constantly pushed over and around the food, and therefore a convection oven cooks food much faster than a conventional oven. Not only does a convection oven cook food more quickly than a conventional oven, but it can also thoroughly cook food at lower temperatures. The average amount of time saved when cooking with a convection oven is about 20 percent of the food's normal cooking time. The temperature a convection oven uses to cook food is also about 20 percent lower than a recipe's suggested cooking temperature. Convection ovens are speedier and more efficient than conventional ovens, and therefore may be more expensive. However, professional chefs from around the world swear by them and rely on them for delicious tasting food. Also, since the air circulation in a convection oven is the same throughout, food will cook at the same rate no matter where it is placed in the oven....on the top or bottom rack or near the front or back. Conventional Oven Traditionally, most personal residences in the United States come equipped with a modern conventional oven. These are the most common types of household ovens, and are used every day to cook all sorts of meals, desserts, breads, and many other types of food. Conventional ovens are similar to convection ovens in that they both cook food using heat. They both have the ability to use either gas or electricity, depending on the hook-up in a home. Some may use either gas or electricity simply depending on what is plugged in to them, and some are made to be either gas specific or electricity specific. In a conventional oven, the heat circulation in the oven can become blocked by pots and pans inside of the oven, which will result in uneven cooking. Uneven cooking is especially noticeable when both the bottom and top racks in the oven are being used at the same time. The items on top will cook faster because heat rises to the tops and when there is a lot in the oven, the heat gets trapped there. There are pros and cons to both conventional and convection ovens. Conventional ovens have been serving people for years and years and food has been cooked successfully in them for many decades. Convection ovens have many followers and fans, but these types of ovens can be hard to get used to...especially for novice cooks.	['48 minutes.']
How many elective courses had the school offered by last month?	"Liu Jiaoyang, 16, carefully winds a bobbin with thread, places it on her sewing machine and then presses her foot down to begin sewing.While she' s doing this, she pretends to guide fabric through the machine.Liu looks forward to the class when she can work on a piece of real cloth, and make a beautiful dress. Each Tuesday afternoon, after the bell rings for the fourth period, Liu becomes a fashion designer.At the same time, the rest of the students at the High School Attached to Yunnan Normal University in Kunming are also having classes a little bit different from the usual ones.Some students dance, others create robots, and still others review films.These are just a few of the other 27 elective courses besides Liu's sewing class that the school began to offer last month. ""The fashion design class has become the bright point of my week.I learn how to choose colors and fabrics as well as sewing and sketching skills.It's all helping me to realize the dream of becoming a fashion designer I' ve had since I was a little girl, "" Liu said. Design is Liu' s favorite, but for other students the electives are interesting lessons which relieve the pressures of schoolwork.Some students, for example, are learning how to play bridge.Chen Xi,15, is one of them.She said, ""Many people think that playing a card game like this in class is a waste of time.But in fact, bridge is a very challenging game that helps develop memory and math skills."""

What is the direct influence of the plastic continent?	Plastics are considered one of the most serious pollutants causing environmental problems. The garbage containing plastics end up in the waterways that eventually flow into the oceans. Accumulation of plastic in the ocean endangers marine life and pollutes the water. Does a plastic continent exist? Yes, a plastic continent does exist and was discovered by Captain Charles Moore a decade ago. The plastic continent is twice the size of Britain and it is the region between the Hawaii Islands and California in the central Pacific Ocean. One of the causes of the lack of marine life in this region is due to pollution and pollutants are none other than plastics. Captain Charles Moore believes plastic waste started accumulating in the 1950s. The plastic continent is the man-made continent of floating plastic waste. The fisher men and the sailors have avoided this region for years. The reasons are: 1. There are no fish here because of the lack of nutrients. 2. The zone also lacks the wind that is essential for sailing. To do research on the ocean pollution, Captain Moore founded Algalita Marine Research Foundation. Other organizations such as Greenpeace supported his cause. The reports of The United Nations Environment Program show that millions of seabirds and marine animals are dying due to the invasion of plastics. The waste plastics can be recycled, but in fact they are being thrown into the oceans. The marine animals mistake these for food and eat them. This leads to their death that affects the marine food chain. To save the oceans from the plastic continent you need to reduce the use of plastics, reuse plastic bags and recycle plastics.

The key point of this speech is about	Hello, children and parents. Thank you all for coming to this meeting. I'd like to start by confirming that we will receive some money from the government for our school trip to Indonesia. We will receive approximately $1,300 per child, which will reduce the overall cost to you. Now that we are sure to get the money, it is time to do some serious planning. We are sure that the trip will be very exciting for the children, especially if they have not traveled overseas before. There are many benefits to having some exposure to different places and cultures. Your children will be able to learn a lot about other people and cultures on this trip. Leanne is with us tonight. Leanne, where are you? Put up your hand, Leanne, so that the people can see who you are. Thank you. Leanne went on the trip last year and will be happy to tell you .of her experiences and answer any questions you might have. We will hear from her a bit later in the meeting. We only have five months to organize the trip. From past experience I can tell you that the time will go very quickly! So we need to start organizing the trip. This is the agenda for tonight's meeting: * Passport: when and how to apply for one * Schedule: what places we will visit * Health matters: what precautions you need to take, plus any special needs that your child may have * Studying: description of the school and type of lessons your child will attend * Money: paying for the trip, plus how much money your child should take * Hotel: where we will be staying *Clothing and personal items: what your children should take with them Are there any other items that you would like to place on the agenda?

John's father respond to his son's puzzlement by _ .	"I have a friend named John Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Ysidro.The last time I was there he shared a story with me. ""It is a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer. When he was a senior,he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up."" That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings,the stables and the track. ""The next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'"" ""The boy went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?'"" ""The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'"" ""The boy went home and asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.'"" ""Finally,after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.'"" John continued, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.""

The Mangrove Rivulus is a type of fish that _ .	"GUATEMALA CITY(Reuters)---- A fish that lives in mangrove swamps across the Americas can live out of water for months at a time, similar to how animals adapted to land millions of years ago, a new study shows. The Mangrove Rivulus, a type of small killifish, lives in small pools of water in a certain type of empty nut or even old beer cans in the mangrove swamps of Belize, the United States and Brazil. When their living place dries up, they live on the land in logs , said Scott Taylor, a researcher at the Brevard Endangered Lands Program in Florida . The fish, whose scientific name is Rivulus marmoratus, can grow as large as three inches. They group together in logs and breathe air through their skin until they can find water again. The new scientific discovery came after a trip to Belize. ""We kicked over a log and the fish just came crowding out,"" Taylor told Reuters in neighboring Guatemala by telephone. He said he will make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year. In lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating. Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in an inactive state. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and remain active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at Canada's University of Guelph. Further studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time. ""These animals live in conditions similar to those that existed millions of years ago, when animals began making the transition form water onto land, "" Wright said."

What happens AFTER a star dies?	How many things can you see in the night sky? A lot! On a clear night you might see the Moon, some planets, and thousands of sparkling stars. You can see even more with a telescope. You might see stars where before you only saw dark space. You might see that many stars look larger than others. You might see that some stars that look white are really red or blue. With bigger and bigger telescope you can see more and more objects in the sky. And you can see those objects in more and more detail. But scientists believe there are some things in the sky that we will never see. We won't see them with the biggest telescope in the world, on the clearest night of the year. That's because they're invisible. They're the mysterious dead stars called black holes. You might find it hard to imagine that stars die. After all, our Sun is a star. Year after year we see it up in the sky, burning brightly, giving us heat and light. The Sun certainly doesn't seem to be getting old or weak. But stars do burn out and die after billions of years. As a star's gases burn, they give off light and heat. But when the gas runs out, the star stops burning and begins to die. As the star cools, the outer layers of the star pull in toward the center. The star squashes into a smaller and smaller ball. If the star was very small, the star ends up as a cold, dark ball called a black dwarf. If the star was very big, it keeps squashing inward until it's packed together tighter than anything in the universe. Imagine if the Earth were crushed until it was the size of a tiny marble . That's how tightly this dead star, a black hole, is packed. What pulls the star in towards its center with such power? It's the same force that pulls you down when you jump - the force called gravity. A black hole is so tightly packed that its gravity sucks in everything - even light. The light from a black hole can never come back to your eyes. That's why you see nothing but blackness. So the next time you stare up at the night sky, remember: there's more in the sky than meets the eyes! Scattered in the silent darkness are black holes - the great mystery of space.

From the passage, we know that _ .	"When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. ""She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,"" a swimming official told her team, ""or you will be disqualified."" Everybody on her team started screaming, ""Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!"" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. ""You have to put the sock on,"" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right."

Playing bridge can help one to fight off diseases because it can _ .	New findings suggest that brainy card games such as contract bridge may temporarily raise production of a key blood cell including in fighting off illness. After 90 minutes of play, bridge players had increased levels of immune cells, according to the research reported last week. A researcher, Diamond, studied bridge players from a women's bridge club. She chose bridge players because the game includes skills stimulating a part of the brain called the dorsolateral cortex. Earlier animal research suggests that this part of the brain may play a role in the immune system. The findings are based on blood samples drawn from 12 women players. Their blood samples showed a rise in levels of white blood cells called T cells after they played bridge for 90 minutes. T cells are produced by the thymus gland and used by the immune system against diseases. The T cell count jumped significantly in eight of the bridge players, and slightly in the other four. The findings contribute to the field of neuroimmunology , whose name reflects the fact that the nervous system and the immune system are not considered separate and isolated systems. What isn't clear is whether the help to the immune system from an activity like contract bridge is lasting or temporary. It is also not clear whether the increase in T cells could finally be targeted against special illnesses.	['raise production of a key blood cell']
What's the main idea of the passage?	"Speaking two languages can actually help offset some effects of aging on the brain, a new study has found. Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism ""a beautiful natural experiment"", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. ""Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,"" he said. ""Actually, it's beneficial. """	['Researchers found that bilingual people can slow down the speed or aging on the brain and respond fast.']
Mr. and Mrs. Green _ the country very much, because it was a quiet clean place.	"Mr. and Mrs. Green lived in a big city, and one summer they went to the country for their holiday. They enjoyed it very much, because it was a quiet, clean place. One day they went for a walk early in the morning and met an old man. He lived on a farm, and he was sitting in the warm sun in front of his house. Mr. Green asked him, ""Do you like to live in this quiet place?"" The old man said, ""Yes, I do,"" Mr. Green said, ""What are the good things about it?"" The old man answered, ""Well, the people here know each other. They often come and visit me, and I often go and visit them. And there are also lots of children here."" Mr. Green said, ""That's interesting. And what are the bad things?"" The old man thought and thought and then said, ""Well, the same things, are they?"""	['liked']
According to the text, Tom Williams .	"As a published author with a degree in English, 33-year-old Tom Williams has achieved more than many people will in a lifetime. What makes those achievements more impressive is that he's dyslexic. At school Tom, who has worked as a literary agent and now has a full-time job with a digital publishing company, would often find keeping up in lessons so tiring that he would fall asleep. ""I found it quite frustrating that everybody else had neat handwriting and could spell and I just couldn't do what they could,"" says Tom, who has written a respected biography of crime writer Raymond Chandler. It wasn't until the age of 17 that he was given a test for dyslexia that showed why he'd struggled for so long. He was always studying for A-levels including English. ""My teacher didn't think I'd get the grades I was capable of,"" he says. ""So she pushed for me to be tested and I'm grateful that she did."" Until his diagnosis Tom had been ranked somewhere in the middle of his classes at school. He couldn't understand why assignments would come back covered in red ink. However, after Tom's diagnosis, when his condition began to be taken properly into account, he found himself at the top of the class. To study English well, he wrote down new words as he came across them and tried to find somewhere quiet and well lit to read and write. He says people were often surprised that someone with dyslexia wanted to pursue a degree in English. Similarly, when he went to study at University College London, the tutors were initially taken aback at his degree choice. Not everyone understands dyslexia so well. ""If teachers aren't trained to recognize signs of dyslexia, they'll think children are less able,"" he says. To make sure that doesn't happen and to encourage a deeper understanding of the condition among those affected by it, Tom becomes a supporter of the charity Dyslexia Action."

What moved the author most according to the text?	"It was the day when the UPSR results would be released. Sleepless nights, pounding hearts... Pupils were laughing with their peers or talking non-stop as their eyes searched for their parents. They looked pale, as if someone had squeezed the air from their lungs. Now I was among the anxious parents. I sat behind my daughter. She looked back, saw me and waved. I nodded. As the teachers walked in, the noise subsided. The year's results were read out. Then came the moment of truth. Pupils who had scored 5As were called out one by one and each of them stepped up on stage. When my daughter went up, I felt fine, but she was crying. I wondered why; maybe she didn't expect to score 5As. Anyway, I said a thankful prayer quietly. After the last name was called, what I saw made an impact on me. One mother just dashed from the back, crying. I thought she was the parent of the last pupil, but I was wrong. She hugged her daughter seated in the front row, saying it was all right that she hadn't scored all As. Her kid was crying. This morn kissed her daughter's forehead and walked straight to the back of the hall, wiping her tears as she walked. She didn't care about the other parents looking at her. How much pressure do we put on these 12-year-olds? All they did was studying and doing endless homework and countless practice questions. Where was the joy that they rightfully needed? As a parent, I think scoring top marks is not the main thing in life. Survival skills are more important than just chewing school texts and regurgitating them in an exam. So let your kids be kids. Let them play, cycle and climb trees. They will be children only once in their lifetime, so don't rob them of their childhood. Let's teach our kids how to be human, how to interact with others, how to help others and recognize ""bad people"". Teach them how to survive in this cruel world!"

According to the passage,which of the following is TRUE?	"One evening,June Griffith was on her way to pick up her son.Almost immediately,she realized that she had gone the wrong way.She'd driven onto railroad tracks and the underside of her car was caught. As Griffith tried to remove the car,its headlights attracted the attention of a passerby,Jordan Ricks,a college student.He ran over. Ricks,22,tried to appear calm as he instructed Gdmth to remove the car.Both of them could now see the wheel between the rails and the uneven track bed.Ricks put his hands under the front fender and gave it a push.It didn't move. He pushed it again with all his strength,Still,no movement. From about 50 feet away,a group of students from the nearby university watched the scene.Ricks signaled to them,and five of the guys came over. He directed them to different sides of the car,and they all put their hands under the flame. ""One,two,three"" Ricks yelled.They all pushed. ""One,two,three!"" he yelled again.The car didn't move. At that moment,they felt the ground begin to shake.Then four dings signaled an on coming train,apd the railroad gates dropped down.In the distance,an unclear line of light appeared,followed by the loud noise of a horn . The guys started yelling,""Get out of the car!Get out of the car!""But Griffith felt _ . When Griffith glanced in the mirror,she saw the train lights approaching.But she worried that the Arthritis in her feet would prevent her from escaping in time and that her car would bedamaged.One of the students,Tommy Stackhouse,20,saw her shocked face and knew he had to act.He reached for the car door and forced it open. The train was just a few hundred feet away.In the last few seconds,Stackhouse grasped Griffith's arm and pulled her from the car.His friend,Frank DiPietrapaul,18,grasped her other arm,and the pair pulled Griffith aside. They watched as the train,crashed into the car,cutting it into half its original size and sending metal pieces flying.Griffith sat crying as the police arrived and sorted through the ruins--and wrote her a ticket for no attention to driving.Eventually,the students went home. A few days later,a reporter asked the young men and Griffith to reunite at a local coffee shop.There a tearful Griffith hugged her rescuers.""These boys are heroes,""she would later tell anyone who would listen.""They saved my life."" Ricks feels only grateful for the outcone.""It was one of those moments,"" he says,""when we could have been gone together.It makes you think how precious life is."""

Tricia Baldwin opposes paid leave because it will _ .	The United States does not require business to pay workers who are sick or caring for a new baby. President Obama and some other U.S. lawmakers want to change time-off policies. Supporters say paid leave is the right thing to do. Opponents say it will kill economic growth. In 2014, the United Nations reported that Papua New Guinea and the U.S. are the only two -- out of 185 -- countries in the world that do not offer workers paid time off to care for newborns. However, several state governments and some private businesses in the U.S. have provided the benefits for their workers. Not every American agrees that requiring businesses to pay workers for leave is a good idea. Tricia Baldwin is a business woman. She is secretary and treasurer for her family's company. Her company employs 400 workers. She says giving all of them paid leave would ruin her company. Instead, Reliable Contracting gives paid leave to employees who have stayed with the company for at least five years. She says paid leave is simply another government order that adds more costs to doing business. President Obama supports paid leave for workers. Recently, he proposed a measure called the Healthy Family Act. It would allow workers to earn up to seven paid days of sick leave a year to care for themselves or family members. Mr. Obama also wants Congress to approve a measure giving all workers six weeks of paid leave to have and care for a new baby. U.S. lawmakers who support the proposed measure say paid leave is good for the families and for businesses. Representative Don Beyer says paid leave is an encouragement to parents to return to the job. Mr. Beyer says training a new employee can cost a company a year's worth of income. But U.S. lawmakers who oppose the bill say they do not want to restrict businesses by requiring them to provide paid leave. They are offering a different measure. The Working Families Flexibility Act would allow employees to work extra hours and earn either time off or more pay.	['add more costs to doing business']

"The reason why there isn't ""earthquake weather"" is that. _ ."	"An earthquake is a trembling or shaking of the ground caused by the sudden release of energy stored in the rocks below the surface. Generally, earthquakes last only seconds. Strong ground shaking during a medium to large earthquake generally lasts about 10 to 30 seconds. Aftershocks can occur once in a while for weeks or even months. Many people think that there is an ""earthquake season"" or a kind of "" earthquake weather "".As a matter of fact, there isn't. Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year and at time of day or night. Earthquakes occur under all weather conditions-sunny, wet. or cold without any special weather tendency . Also, you don't need to worry that the ground will open up and swallow people when earthquakes occur. Open ground cracks may form during an earthquake, for example, to land sliding or ground falling. However, such cracks tend to be open gaps (they don't "" swallow"") that a person could stand in afterwards. The safest place in an earthquake is an open field because buildings and falling objects can injure or kill you. If you are indoors, when you feel the ground start to shake, take cover immediately under a table or strong piece of furniture, placing something between falling objects and yourself. Don't "" attempt to use the stairs or an elevator to get out of the building.."	['an earthquake can happen at any time and in any kind of weather.']
In the author's opinion, _ .	"However urban life strikes you, cities worldwide have been growing ever more rapidly. Some of this growth has occurred in the developed world, but the most dramatic increase has been in the Third World. Almost all the world's population growth over the next 30 years will take place in the cities of developing countries By the year 2030, for the first time in history, 60 percent of the world's people will be living in cities. This is actually good news in some ways. ""Cities are the fundamental building blocks of prosperity,"" says Marc Weiss, chairman of the Prague Institute for Global Urban Development, "" both for the nation and for families."" Industrial and commercial activities in urban areas account for between 50 and 80 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries of the world"" there's the crazy notion that the way to deal with a city's problems is to keep people out of them,""Weiss continued. ""But the problems of the rural life are even more serious than those of the city."" For better or worse, urban-watchers are clear on one point: The quality of life for most people in the future will be determined by the quality of cities. Those cities will be bigger than ever. And yet, population numbers by themselves don't determine a city's prospects; after all, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Hamburg, Germany, have the same population. Nor is explosive growth necessarily the determining factor. ""City problems,"" one authority points out, ""mostly have to do with weak, ineffective, and usually unrepresentative city governments."""

The writer thinks of the past all the more when he sees those who had grown up with him _ .	"About this time every year, I get very nostalgic . Walking through my neighborhood on a fall afternoon reminds me of a time not too long ago when sounds of children filled the air, children playing games on a hill, and throwing leaves around in the street below. I was one of those children, carefree and happy. I live on a street that is only one block long. I have lived on the same street for sixteen years. I love my street. One side has six houses on it, and the other has only two houses, with a small hill in the middle and a huge cottonwood tree on one end. When I think of home, I think of my street. Only I see it as it was before. Unfortunately things change. One day, not long ago, I looked around and saw how different everything has become. Life on my street will never be the same because neighbors are quickly grown old, friends are growing up and leaving, and the city is planning to destroy my precious hill and sell the property to contractors. It is hard for me to accept that many of my wonderful neighbors are growing old and won't be around much longer. I have fond memories of the couple across the street, who sat together on their porch swing almost every evening, the widow next door who yelled at my brother and me for being too loud, and the crazy old man in a black suit who drove an old car. In contrast to those people, the people I see today are very old neighbors who have seen better days. The man in the black suit says he wants to die, and another neighbor just sold his house and moved into a nursing home. The lady who used to yell at us is too tired to bother any more, and the couple across the street rarely go out to their front porch these days. It is difficult to watch these precious people as they near the end of their lives because at once I thought they would live forever. The ""comings and goings"" of the younger generation of my street are now mostly ""goings"" as friends and peers move on. Once upon a time, my life and the lives of my peers revolved around home. The boundary of our world was the gutter at the end of the street. We got pleasure from playing night games or from a breathtaking ride on a tricycle. Things are different now, as my friends become adults and move on. Children who rode tricycles now drive cars. The kids who once played with me now have new interests and values as they go their separate ways. Some have gone away to college like me, a few got married, two went into the army, and one went to prison. Watching all these people grow up and go away makes me long for the good old days. Perhaps the biggest change on my street is the fact that the city is going to turn my precious hill into several lots for new homes. For sixteen years, the view out of my kitchen window has been a view of that hill. The hill was a fundamental part of my childhood life; it was the hub of social activity for the children of my street. We spent hours there building forts, sledding, and playing tag. The view out of my kitchen window now is very different; it is one of tractors and dump trucks tearing up the hill. When the hill goes, the neighborhood will not be the same. It is a piece of my childhood. It is a visual reminder of being a kid. Without the hill, my street will be just another pea in the pod. There was a time when my street was my world, and I thought my world would never change. But something happened. People grow up, and people grow old. Places changes, and with the change comes the heartache of knowing I can never go back to the times I loved. In a year or so, I will be gone just like many of my neighbors. I will always look back to my years as a child, but the place I remember will not be the silent street whose peace is interrupted by the sounds of construction. It will be the happy, noisy, somewhat strange, but wonderful street I knew as a child."	['leave the neighborhood they grew up in']
"What does ""go Dutch"" mean? It means _ ."	"When you discuss about eating out with your friend, first of all, you must make it clear who will pay for the meal.If somebody suggests having lunch with his friend, he might simply say something like this ""I'm afraid it'll have to be some place nearby ,as I have little money."" The other person may say. ""OK. I'll meet you at Mcdonald's."" This means he has agreed that the two will go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He may say ""Oh, no. I want to take you for lunch at Johnson's "" This means the person is to pay the bill for both of them. Although the other person is pleased with the invitation, there is one reason why he shouldn't accept it by simply saying ""Thank you."" American customs are much the same as those in other parts of the world. American women used to expect men to pay for all the meals. But today, some of them like to. However, if a woman is asked to attend a dinner or a dance outside, the invitaton itself means ""Come as my guest"". So, as you see, it is a polite thing to make the situation clear at the very beginning."	['each person pays for himself']
Why do some Japanese parents send their children to university-based kindergartens?	"Many Americans are turning to Japan, they think, a country of high academic achievement and economic success, for possible answers. However, the answers provided by Japanese preschools are not the ones Americans expected to find. In most Japanese preschools, surprisingly little emphasis is put on academic instruction. In one survey, 300 Japanese and 210 American preschool teachers, child development specialists, and parents were asked about various aspects of early childhood education. Only 2 percent of the Japanese respondents listed ""to give children a good start academically"" as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools. In contrast, over half the American respondents chose this as one of their top three choices. To prepare children for successful careers in first grade and beyond, Japanese preschools do not teach reading, writing, and mathematics, but rather skills such as determination, concentration, and the ability to work as a member of a group. The huge majority of young Japanese children are taught to read at home by their parents. Like in America, there is diversity in Japanese early childhood education. Some Japanese kindergartens have specific aims, such as early musical training or potential development. In large cities, some kindergartens are attached to universities that have elementary and secondary schools. Some Japanese parents believe that if their young children attend a university-based program, it will increase the children's chances of eventually being admitted to top-rated schools and universities. Several more progressive programs have introduced free play as a way out for the heavy intellectualizing in some Japanese kindergartens."

What is the best title for this passage?	"Have you ever been in a situation, where you felt uneasy because of something you think you may have forgotten to do or perhaps a feeling that you annoyed someone whom you wanted to get along with really well. If you have experienced such feelings and worse on a regular basis, then you most probably are a victim of anxiety attacks. All of us, to some extent, have experienced anxiety at different levels. There are somethings you may know about anxiety, and some things that you may not be familiar with. So in order to be prepared for your unexpected feeling of anxiety, you need to get to know what anxiety is before it _ into a panic attack. Anxiety is simply the feeling of discomfort, uneasiness or fear of what may eventually happen resulting from an imagined, or a real threatening condition. On the extreme end panic attacks can occur due to heightened feelings of anxiety. There are two main symptoms during an anxiety / panic attack and these are physical and emotional symptoms. Physical symptoms include difficulty in breathing, shaking, direct feeling of heat, rapid heartbeat and tiredness while emotional symptoms deal with worrying, depression, fear, and lack of focus. In spite of the negative impression we have for anxiety, it is not dangerous in any way whatever. The feeling of anxiety is not bad, in fact it's more of a defensive feeling which protects us from possible danger by engaging a response within us in fight or fight situations. So it's not the ""bad guy"", you just have to learn how to control it. Panic attacks, however, are far more dangerous and should be a concern to your health. Panic can sometimes result in blurred vision, difficulty in breathing due to a tight chest. The best way to different anxiety from any serious illness is to ask a medical expert for advice on a regular basis."	['Getting to know Anxiety']
What's the writer's attitude towards the scheme?	"Hundreds of secondary schools are using a _ reward scheme which ""bribes"" pupils with iPods and DVD players to turn up in classes and do homework. Almost one million schoolchildren have been issued with supermarket-style reward cards which allow them to collect good-behavior ""points"" and cash them in for prizes. Schools taking part in the ""Vivo Miles"" scheme are spending several thousand pounds a year in an attempt to cut truancy and promote achievements. The prizes are ultimately funded by the taxpayer, through school budgets. Nearly 500 secondary schools, one in six, have decided to take part in the scheme, which is intended to replace old-style rewards such as stickers and golden stars. But the extent of rewards being offered in schools brought a warning that a generation of children is growing up expecting to be rewarded at every stage. Many youngsters are collecting points for ordinary achievements such as remembering to bring their PE kit and wearing the correct uniform. Under the scheme, teachers award Vivo points--worth 1 penny each--according to the school's policy. Schools typically spendPS4 toPS6 on prizes per pupil each year, although some commit considerably more. Most pupils accumulate between 400 and 600 Vivos a year. Vivo Miles insists it is ""pretty rare"" for a pupil to accumulate enough points to buy an iPod, which requires 3,100 Vivos. But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the scheme amounted to ""bribery"". ""It misleads children into thinking anything which requires effort has to have a special reward,"" he said. ""This 'all must have prizes' view is damaging to children in the long-term."" The scheme amounted to an ""admission of failure"" by schools. He said. ""It shows a school has failed to convince children education is important."""	['Opposed.']
By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that _ .	"An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles). Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun. What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment."

Which of the following is FALSE?	"Four Simple Keys to Transform Your Life The Power of Choice.Every one of us makes countless choices every day.Every choice we make has an impact on our lives.Even insignificant choices can affect what we experience and how we feel.When hunger strikes, we can reach for a healthy, nutritious snack, or we can choose the sugar high of junk food.The more important the decision, the greater its effect.For instance, how do I act towards that person who treated me badly? Do I generally choose to be passive, or do I actively set clear intentions and create what I want in my life? Every choice we make, however big or small, affects us in some way. How Do You Make Choices? If you are interested in living a richer, fuller life, there is a foundation upon which you can base all of your decisions which can make life better not only for you, but also for those around you.This foundation is to choose based on what's best for all.Imagine a world where every parent, spouse , friend, teacher, business person, and politician truly did their best to choose what's best for all involved in every decision they made. We would certainly live in a more caring, supportive world. It's the Intention.""But how do I know what is really best?"" you might ask.The answer is simple.It doesn't matter.What matters is not the choice you make, but rather the intention beind your choice.What matters is that whatever decision you make, you are clear in your intention of choosing based on what's best for all.If it later turns out that you made what appears to have been a bad choice, there's no need for guilt.Knowing that you did your best to choose with a sincere desire for what's best for all, your conscience stays clear and open.This then allows you to more easily learn from your mistakes, and to live with a clear heart and mind. What's Best for Me, Too! Choosing what's best does not mean you have to always sacrifice yourself for others.An overly exhausted mother can lose her temper easily.Some time off for this mother might seem selfish, yet in the long run, it can help her to be a better mother to her children.So as we move through each day of our lives, let us remember to include ourselves as we do our best to choose what's best for all."	['Whenever hunger strikes, we will reach for a junk snack']
What will happen to students praised for being smart in face of choosing tasks compared to students praised for working hard?	"We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them, but we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes need to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned. As Thomas Edison said, ""I am not discouraged, because every abandoned wrong attempt is another step forward. "" Furthermore, we often make mistakes because we try new things-we wander away from accepted paths. Teflon, penicillin-these are examples of great discoveries made by mistake. Take a page from Albert Einstein, who said, ""Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. """	['He will choose a less challenging task.']
The author would probably agree that _ .	"Who taught you to speak English? Your parents, while you were a child? Your teacher at school? Perhaps even the BBC as a grown-up. Whoever it was, somehow you have developed an understanding of what is rapidly becoming a truly global language. There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of "" mono-culturalism"", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music? Does it matter if an increasing number of people speak the same language? I would have thought the other way around although I have never accepted the argument that if only we all understood each other better, there would be fewer wars. _ ... If we all speak English, will we then all start eating McDonalds burgers? Surely not. If English becomes more dominant , it will kill other languages? I doubt it. When I travel in Africa or Asia, I am always surprised by how many people can speak not only their own language but often one or more other related languages, as well as English and perhaps some French or German as well. When we discussed this on Talking Point a couple of years ago, we received a wonderfully poetic email from a listener in Ireland. ""The English language is a beautiful language. Maybe it's like a rose,"" he said. ""But who would ever want their garden just full of roses?"" Well, I love roses, and I think they make a beautiful addition to any garden. But the way I see it, just by planting a few roses, you don't necessarily need to pull out everything else. If more and more people want to plant English roses, that's fine by me."

What may be the best title for the passage?	"As an experienced photojournalist in Nashville, Tennessee, I was hired by USA Today newspaper to photograph a spinal bifida corrective surgical procedure. It was to be performed on a twenty-one week old fetus in uterus at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. At that time, in 1999, twenty-one weeks in uterus was the earliest that the surgical team would consider for surgery. The worst possible outcome would be that the surgery would cause premature delivery, and no child born earlier than twenty-three weeks had survived. The tension could be felt in the operating room as the surgery began. A typical C-section cut was made to access the uterus, which was then lifted out and laid at the junction of the mother's thighs . The entire procedure would take place within the uterus, and no part of the child was to breach the surgical opening. During the procedure, the position of the fetus was adjusted by gently moving the outside of the uterus. The entire surgical procedure on the child was completed in one hour and thirteen minutes. When it was over, the surgical team breathed a sigh of relief, as did I. As a doctor asked me what speed of film I was using, out of the corner of my eye I saw the uterus shake, but no one's hands were near it. _ was shaking from within. Suddenly, an entire arm thrust out of the opening, then pulled back until just a little hand was showing. The doctor reached over and lifted the hand, which reacted and squeezed the doctor's finger. As if testing for strength, the doctor shook the tiny fist. Samuel held firm. I took the picture! Wow! It happened so fast that the nurse standing next to me asked, ""What happened?"" ""The child reached out,"" I said. ""Oh. They do that all the time,"" she responded. The surgical opening to the uterus was closed and the uterus was then put back into the mother and the C-section opening was closed. It was ten days before I knew if the picture was even in focus . To ensure no digital manipulation of images before they see them, USA Today requires that film be submitted unprocessed. When the photo editor finally phoned me he said, ""It's the most incredible picture I've ever seen."""	['An Amazing Moment']
According to the passage,Karen Turner may agree that _ .	"Moving to a new neighborhood,town,state,or even country can be a pretty scary experience. All you know is that things will be different and chances are you won't know the kids at your new school. The experiences that go with moving make many kids feel nervous and worried. This is perfectly normal but don't let these emotions overrun your thoughts! You will soon get used to your surroundings and find new friends at your new school. Leaving old friends and familiar places behind can be difficult. However,as you begin the moving process,keep in mind that saying goodbye to your old house,school,and friends does not mean that you have to forget them or that your farewell is permanent!If you're moving to a new state or even a different country and won't see your friends for a long time,don't despair. Make sure to ask everyone for their address so you can write them letters. Also,thanks to the Internet,it is very easy to stay in touch through email or instant messaging technologies. With your parent's permission,you can even create a blog or web page to chronicle all of your new experiences. Include your thoughts,tales of your new adventures,even pictures of new friends,your new house,and new town. Your old friends will love seeing what you are busy with. Many schools have an orientation program where a student already established at the school shows a new student around for their first week. This can help you to find your way around the school and to make new friends faster. While moving is tough on kids of any age,high school counselor Karen Turner says moves can be particularly difficult for teens .""I think moving during adolescents is an extremely stressful experience,especially if you are into your junior high or senior year. Students tend to have established a very strong peer network during that period in their lives. Often this has more influence on them even than their families in some cases,and when they are torn from that there's often resentment .""However,Turner adds that while moving isn't easy,there are things that your parents and the school can do to help you deal with the change."

The sales of the life extension drugs so far clearly show that _ .	Here is some news of the future. March 20, 2035 There was a lot of news around the life extension drugs that hit the market a decade ago. They didn't promise that you would like forever, but they gave you a chance to extend your life an extra five to ten years. Even though the life expectancy rate at birth has increased greatly, the life expectancy for seniors hasn't improved that much. Basically, you have a greater chance to become a senior, but you will not have a much longer lifespan, and this is where the anti-aging drugs intend to kick in. So, do the anti-aging drugs work? Well,it is too early to tell. But the sales so far are very good. April 19, 2035 Of the total US population of 378 million, people over 65 years of age now make up 20% for the first time. The senior ratio of only 4.1% by year 1900, and 12.4% 30 years ago. The number of people above 65 compared to those of what is considered working ages, between 15 and 64, is currently 33.7%. This is up from 18.5% since year 2005, which means that for every retired person there are now two workers, compared to four workers 30 years ago. The number of people above the age of 80 has grown to 23.8 million, making them 6.3% of the total population compared to 3.6% in 2005. April 12, 2040 Although introduced in the market only five years ago, 10% of all hydrogen fuel now sold in the US is of the environmentally friendly Re-Hydro label, produced through eletrolysis based on a source of 100% renewable energy. Several producers have turned to producing Re-Hydro, mainly because of lower tax, which also keeps the price of Re-Hydro on the same level as regular hydrogen. Most analysts believe that Re-Hydro will be the dominating fuel in the future.	['people want to give them a try']

They have the largest collection of Chinese plants in the world outside China. ""Ever since people in Britainstarted gardening for pleasure they have used Chinese plants,"" Patterson told English Corner. ""There are probably Chinese flowers in nearly every garden inBritain. This is a good chance to give something back."" The garden has been carefully designed to mix traditional British skills with the local Chinese environment. David Patterson describes the garden as ""formal but gentle"". It contains a raised flower bed, a summer house and a lot of local trees. The garden is contained behind a wall of local, yellow stone. It is intended to be a place of serious thinking and quiet enjoyment. ""You could say that we've painted a picture,"" said David Patterson. ""And we have designed the garden to continue for a long time, so that the people of Kunmingwill be able to enjoy it long after the Expo is over."""	['an introduction to the British Garden']
The bike brake lever was designed for the purpose of_.	"Inspired by a 9-year-old cyclist who uses only part of one hand, a group of University of Guelph students has won an international award for their invention--a bike brake lever . It pulls both the front brake and the back brake at the same time. Lauren Turner was able to ride her bike, but not as confidently and quickly as her friends. ""She couldn't use the front brake. She was only using the back brake, but the front brake makes you stop twice as fast,"" says Micha Wallace, who with Katie Bell, Anina Sakaguchi and Andrew Morris won second prize in the James Dyson Awards for their single-handed bike braking lever. ""She used it all last summer and she had no problems. She said it helped her go faster because she felt more confident in her braking abilities. She felt safer."" says Wallace. The invention was the fourth-year design project for the four students. They designed, tested and created a prototype within a four-month period. When Wallace heard about the James Dyson Awards on the news, she and her co-inventors entered their project in the UK-based contest. The contest mainly rewards student designers who create products that improve the way we live. The Guelph students collected the second prize -PS2,000 for them, plus PS500 for their school. As well, they had a chance to meet James Dyson, a UK inventor. While praising the students for their creativity, Dyson said the single-handed lever could improve safety for all cyclists. ""By using both brakes at once,"" he explains, ""you could prevent the possibility of flying over the handlebars and ending up with an injury."" The students are hoping to sell the patent to a major company. It may be used in other devices that require two hands for operation."	['helping the disabled ride their bike safely']
What can't we do by Wechat ?	In our daily lives, Wechat is really hot now. Many people express themselves, exchange ideas and deliver information by Wechat. There are a number of reasons for Wechat to be popular. To begin with, Wechat is a cheap way of communication, which cuts down a great deal of the cost made by phone calls. Next, Wechat is to the taste of the most of people. Its attractive and lots of functions are loved widely. What's more, convenience also leads to its popularity. It is _ no matter where we are. However, it has problems, too. First of all, our IDs might be revealed when we use Wechat and we could be in danger. Secondly, we may spend more time on Wechat instead of with our family. As a result, relationship could break down. The last problem is that our attention might be drawn too much and sometimes we may find it difficult to focus on study. There is no doubt that Wechat will improve as time goes by. So let's look forward to the better Wechat and have more fun with it.	['Make phone calls.']
What is the author's attitude towards homeownership?	"Homeownership has let us down. For generations, Americans believed that owning a home was undoubtedly good. Our political leaders hammered home the point. Franklin Roosevelt held that a country of homeowners was ""unconquerable."" Homeownership could even save babies, save children, save families and save America. A house with a lawn and a fence wasn't just a nice place to live in or a risk-free investment; it was a way to transform a nation. No wonder leaders of all political types wanted to spend more than $100 billion a year on subsidies and tax breaks to encourage people to buy. But the dark side of homeownership is now all too apparent: Indeed, easy lending stimulated by the cult of homeownership may have caused the financial crisis. Housing remains a drag on the economy. Existing-home sales in April dropped 27% from the prior month, worsening fears of a double-drop. And all that is just the obvious tale of a housing bubble and what happened when it popped. _ For the better part of a century, politics, industry and culture lined up to create a fetish of the idea of buying a house. Homeownership has done plenty of good over the decades; it has provided stability to tens of millions of families. Yet by idealizing the act of buying a home, we have ignored the downsides. In the bubble years, lending standards slipped dramatically, allowing many Americans to put far too much of their income into paying for their housing. And we ignored longer-term phenomena too. Homeownership contributed to the hollowing out of cities and kept renters out of the best neighborhoods. It fed America's overuse of energy and oil. It made it more difficult for those who had lost a job to find another. Perhaps worst of all, it helped us become casually self-deceiving: By telling ourselves that homeownership was a pathway to wealth and stable communities and better test scores, we avoided dealing with these frightening issues head-on. Now, as the U.S. recovers from the biggest housing bust since the Great Depression, it is time to rethink how realistic our expectations of homeownership are--and how much money we want to spend chasing them. Many argue that homeownership should not be a goal pursued at all costs."	['Cautious.']
The problem Howe was trying to solve was _ .	"Early one morning,more than a hundred years ago,an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep.He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem: It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Though he was tired,Howe slept badly.He turned and turned.Then he had a dream.He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine.When he tried to do so,Howe ran into the same problem as before.The thread kept getting caught around the needle.The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe.They came up towards him with their spears raised.But suddenly the inventor noticed something.There was a hole in the tip of each spear.The inventor awoke from the dream,realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem.Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle,he should make it run through a small hole in the center of the needle.This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Elias Howe was not the only one in finding the answer to his problem in this way.Thomas Edison,the inventor of the electric light,said his best ideas came into him in dreams.So did the great physicist Albert Einstein.Charlotte Bronte also drew in her dreams in writing Jane Eyre. To know the value of dreams,you have to understand what happens when you are asleep.Even then,a part of your mind is still working.This unconscious ,but still active part understands your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.It stores all sorts of information that you may have forgotten or never have really noticed.It is only when you fall asleep that this part of the brain can send messages to the part you use when you are awake.However,the unconscious part acts in a special way.It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first.This is why dreams are sometimes called ""secret messages to ourselves ""."

In Britain in the 1890s, _ .	"In Britain in the 1890s there was a postcard ""craze "". People formed clubs and collected and exchanged postcards. Even Queen Victoria had her own private collection. When Edward was the king, the British had a cheap and good postal system. If anyone wanted to tell a friend that they were coming for tea in the afternoon, they would send a postcard in the morning. ""Drop me a card"" was as common then as ""give me a ring"" as now. In 1902 an important step was taken. The government said that half of the side that was used for the address on the postcard could be used for messages, and the whole of the other side could be used for a picture. It was then that the simple postcard, as we know now, was created."	['people were interested in collecting postcards']

What percentage of the participants noticed the big bear?	"We usually believe what our brain tells us, but there are some amazing facts which show that the brain tricks us. As a result, we think we can see something that is not actually there or we ignore things that actually are there. Scientists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris have researched this phenomenon , which they call ""change blindness"". Their experiments show how we sometimes just do not see what is in front of our eyes because _ . Here is one of their most famous experiments. In this experiment, the participants were shown a video of two groups of people (one group in white T-shirts and one group in black T-shirts) who passed basketballs around in a hallway. Each group had three members. Simons and Chabris asked the participants to count how many times the white team passed the ball. While the two teams were passing their balls around, a person dressed up as a big bear walked through the group and stopped to look at the camera. Simons and Chabris found that about half of the research participants did not notice the big bear."	['About 50%.']
What does inflation mean?	It is a matter of common observation that although incomes keep going up over the years,people never seem to become much better off! Prices are rising continuously.The condition is termed one kind 0f inflation, the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable.People have got used in recent years to higher and higher rates of inflation. What could be bought ten years ago for one dollar now costs well over two dollars. It seems that this rate of inflation is tending to rise rather than to fall.If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices,one might think that inflation does not matter.But it does when money is losing value,it lacks one of the qualities of a good money---stability of value.It is no longer acceptable as a store of value;and it becomes an unsuitable standard of deferred payments.Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession,so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore stimulates people spending,and prevents people from saving.	['Money keeps losing its value.']
The government has decided to allow scientists to clone human embryos because they think that _ .	"According to an English newspaper, scientists could begin cloning human embryos in Britain in 2001. It is understood that the government has already agreed to use Frankenstein's technology, believing the benefits are more important than ethical concerns .Researchers think it will be possible to grow brain tissue to cure the diseases that are likely to get worse as time passes like Alzheimer's , and produce ""spare part"" organs like hearts and kidneys for transplant . Ministers are aware that the change in the law will be as controversial as the law which legalized abortion more than 30 years ago. Some politicians reacted angrily , arguing that the government had already made up its mind without discussion. Church leaders and anti-abortion campaigners have long expressed their horror at the plans, arguing that even the earliest embryos are forms of human life.They believe that getting an embryo from cells is morally unacceptable . And it will also cause arguments about how far scientists should interfere with nature and lead to accusations that _ are ""playing God"". The cloning of human embryos to provide spare parts is regarded by most experts to be the most important step forward in the 21stcentury medicine. Scientists say treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's will be the first application of cloning. The ability to clone embryos was first achieved by scientists in Scotland in the late 1990s and now the ability to grow stem cells into tissues and organs is being developed by American researchers. Combining the two technologies will mean an end to long waits for organs from donors and problems caused by rejection of transplanted tissues by the body. Ian Wilmut, the man who cloned Dolly the sheep, has warned that British experts will go to America, where such work is legal, if the government does not permit it."

What can we learn from the text?	"The deadly earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11 damaged two nuclear power stations. Officials are now working to prevent dangerous radiation from poisoning the air in the area surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The Japanese government has ordered people living within 12 and a half miles of the plant to , and asked those living 12 and a half to 20 miles away to stay indoors. Nuclear power plants create energy using a chemical reaction that produces large amounts of heat. Reactors in Japan have many long, thin rods, called fuel rods , which must be kept cool. If the reactor's fuel rods aren't cooled, the reaction can burn out of control. That's what happened at the two Japanese plants after the quake caused a power failure and the cooling systems malfunctioned . This overheating could cause radiation to escape and sicken many people. Japan's 54 nuclear reactors are built to withstand the many small or moderate earthquakes the country faces each year. But Friday's earthquake was one of the most severe earthquakes ever recorded. People exposed to unsafe levels of radiation have a higher than normal risk of getting cancer. The Japanese government has been distributing potassium iodide pills to people in the surrounding areas to protect those who may have come in contact with radiation from the power plant. The pills flood the body with healthy potassium iodide. The potassium iodide works to crowd out ""bad"" iodine in the body that may have been poisoned by radiation. On Tuesday morning, 750 workers left the Fukushima Daiichi plant. However, 50 workers stayed behind to use sweater to cool the fuel rods. These dedicated employees are risking their own lives to save many others. On Thursday, officials used helicopters, fire trucks, and water cannons to spray water on the reactors to cool the fuel rods. But it's not clear whether these efforts were successful. Officials are now working on a power line to restore electricity to the plant. They hope this will help restart the plant's cooling system and stop the fuel rods from leaking radiation."

What does the author say is the general view about health care?	"Our risk of cancer rises dramatically as we age. So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors -- or doesn't it? While such vigilant tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it's important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing. In many cases, screening can lead to additional biopsies and surgeries to remove cancer, which can cause side effects, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not pose serious health problems in patients' remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so ingrained that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a riotous reaction among doctors, patients and advocacy groups. It's hard to uproot deeply held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or prior personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the remainder, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy . A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening- especially considering the explosion of the elderly that will soon swell our population. It's not an easy calculation to make, but one that make sense for the whole patient. Dr. Otis Brawley said, ""Many doctors are ordering these tests purely to cover themselves. We need to think about the rational use of health care and stop talking about the rationing of health care."" That means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better."	['The more, the better.']

At about 3 pm, drinking water can clean out the _ in your body.	Drinking water is good for your health. There are some scientific ways of drinking water. 1. It is the best medicine to drink two glasses of water in the morning. 2. Drink clean water. 3. Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water. Your blood gets thicker when you sleep. Water will make your blood less thick. Besides, we should drink 2L of water every day. Water is so important for our life. We should drink water often.

What must we do in order to make our vocabulary large?	"A rabbit is running into its hole. You may ask, ""What happened?"" Well, when a rabbit sees something dangerous, it runs away. Its tail moves up and down as it runs. When other rabbits see this tail moving up and down, they run too. They know that there is danger. The rabbit has told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal. Many other animals use this kind of language. When a bee found some food, it goes back to his home. It cannot tell the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance in the air. This tells the bees where the food is. Some animals say things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, each with its own meaning. But human beings have something that no animals have --- a large number of words about things, actions, feelings or ideas. We are able to give each other information, to tell or inform other people what is in our mind or how we feel. By writing words down we can remind ourselves of the things what have happened, or send messages to people far away. No animals can do this. No animals has the wonderful power of language. No one knows how man learned to make words. Somehow he learned to make them. As centuries went by, he made more and more new words. This is what we mean by language. People living in different countries made different kinds of words. Today there are about fifteen hundred different languages in the world. A very large English dictionary, for example, contains four or five hundred thousand words. But we do not know all these. The words we know are called vocabulary. We should try to make our vocabulary larger. Read as many books as possible. When we meet a new word, look it up in the dictionary. A dictionary is the Most useful book."	['Try to read as many books as possible.']
According to the passage, complex artificial bacteria, which will follow the first simple man-made bacteria, are intended to _ .	"Scientists have not come close to understanding all the different kinds of life on the planet, but US researcher Craig Venter is already working on creating the first artificial life. Venter and his researchers made a breakthrough this August. They successfully moved the DNA of one type of bacteria to a yeast cell, changed it, then put it into another bacterial cell. ""Bacteria have systems that protect them from foreign DNA,"" Venter explained to the BBC. In the experiment, the team managed to block this system. The experiment was performed on a simple type of bacteria called Mycoplasma mycoides. The team took the bacteria's genes and put them into a yeast cell. Putting the DNA in a yeast cell allowed the team to change the genes----in this case, taking out a gene that was not necessary for the bacteria to live. They then put the gene into a host bacteria cell. The cell went on to divide normally, producing new healthy bacteria. In January, the team created artificial genes of a new type of bacteria. Their next goal is to put the artificial DNA into a host cell to create a new species, according to a report inSciencemagazine. ""If we don't make any errors, I think it should work and we should have the first artificial species by the end of the year,"" Venter said in the report. The first artificial life from is likely to be a simple man-made bacteria, to prove that the technology can work. But that form will be followed by more complex bacteria that turn coal into cleaner natural gas, or algae that can take in carbon dioxide and change it into fuel. Many scientists think it's good news to have this artificial life, but others are worried that the technology to create new organisms might end up in the wrong hands, with dangerous results."

Which of the following words can best describe Gladys?	"Mr. Hungerton, her father, really was absolutely centered upon his own silly self. If anything could have driven me from Gladys, it would have been the thought of such a father-in-law. I am convinced that he really believed in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a week for the pleasure of his company, and very especially to hear his views upon bimetallism . For an hour or more that evening I listened to his tiring talk about bad money driving out good, and the true standards of exchange. ""Suppose,"" he cried, ""that all the debts in the world were called up at once, and immediate payment insisted upon,--what under our present conditions would happen then?"" I gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man, upon which he jumped from his chair, scolding me for my thoughtless quickness, which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in my presence. At last I was alone with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come! She sat with that proud, delicate figure of hers outlined against the red curtain. How beautiful she was! Gladys was full of every womanly quality. I was about to break the long and uneasy silence, when two critical, dark eyes looked round at me, and the proud head was shaken disapprovingly. ""I have a feeling that you are going to propose, Ned. I do wish you wouldn't; for things are so much nicer as they are."" I drew my chair a little nearer. ""Now, how did you know that I was going to propose?"" I asked in wonder. ""Don't women always know? Do you suppose any woman in the world was ever taken unawares? But--oh, Ned, our friendship has been so good and so pleasant! What a pity to spoil it! Don't you feel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to face as we have talked?"" She had sprung from her chair, as she saw signs that I proposed to announce some of my wants. ""You've spoiled everything, Ned,"" she said. ""It's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing comes in! It is such a pity! Why can't you control yourself?"" ""But why can't you love me, Gladys? Is it my appearance, or what?"" ""No, it isn't that."" ""My character?"" She nodded severely. ""What can I do to mend it?"" She looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my mind than her whole-hearted confidence. ""Now tell me what's amiss with me?"" ""I'm in love with somebody else,"" said she. It was my turn to jump out of my chair. ""It's nobody in particular,"" she explained, laughing at the expression of my face: ""only an ideal. I've never met the kind of man I mean."" ""Tell me about him. What does he look like?"" ""Oh, he might look very much like you."" ""How dear of you to say that! Well, what is it that he does that I don't do? I'll have a try at it, Gladys, if you will only give me an idea what would please you."" ""Well, it is never a man that I should love, but always the glories he had won; for they would be reflected upon me. Think of Richard Burton! When I read his wife's life of him I could so understand her love! And Lady Stanley! Did you ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband? These are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul, and yet be the greater, not the less, on account of her love, honored by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds."" ""And if I do----"" Her dear hand rested upon my lips. ""Not another word, Sir! You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour ago; only I hadn't the heart to remind you. Some day, perhaps, when you have won your place in the world, we shall talk it over again."""	['Lovely, confident, and idealistic.']
Before the study, which of the following was unclear?	"Six-month-old babies are strictly limited in what they can remember about the objects they see in the world. If you hide several objects from babies, they will only remember one of those objects. But a new study, which was published in an issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, finds that when babies ""forget"" about an object, not all is lost. Researchers used to think that babies less than two years old did not understand that an object continues to exist when it is not in the baby's view. But in mid-1980s, new ways of doing experiments with babies found that they do, in fact, know that objects don't disappear when they do not look at them -- a concept known as object permanence. But it was still unknown what babies needed to remember about objects in order to remember their existence. Now Melissa Kibbe, of John Hopkins University, and Alan Leslie, of Rutgers University, are working to figure out exactly what it is that babies remember about objects. For the new study, they showed six-month-old babies two objects, a disk and a triangle. Then they hid the objects behind small screens, first one shape, then the other. Earlier research has shown that young babies can remember what was hidden most recently, but have more trouble remembering the first object that was hidden. Once the shapes were hidden, they lifted the screen in front of the first object. Sometimes they showed babies the shape that was hidden there originally , but sometimes it was the other shape, and sometimes the object had _ completely. Psychologists measure how long babies look at something to see how surprised they are. In Kibbe and Leslie's study, babies weren't particularly surprised to see that screen had changed, for example, from a triangle to a disk. But if the object was gone altogether, the babies looked significantly longer, indicating surprise at an unexpected outcome: ""This shows that even though babies don't remember the shape of the object, they know that it should continue to exist,"" Kibbe says. ""They remember the object without remembering the features that identify that object."" This helps explain how the young brain processes information about objects, Leslie say. He thinks the brain has a structure that acts like a kind of pointer, a mental finger that points at an object."	"[""What made babies remember objects' existence.""]"
From Paragraphs 2 and 3, we can learn that Derrius _ .	"Derrius Quarles, 19, had an unhappy childhood. But the Chicago teen didn't give up. He tried his best and won $1 million in college scholarships ! Now Derrius is a successful college student with a bright future. When Derrius was 4, his father was killed. His mother couldn't take care of him because of taking drugs. Derrius and his 9-year-old brother sometimes had to steal food to eat. Derrius felt different from other kids. In seventh grade, Derrius went to live in a foster home . His foster parents weren't nice to him. They told him that he'd never be anything in life. Derrius didn't do his best in school. The summer after ninth grade, that changed. Derrius had signed up for a biology class. He didn't go to class the first day. On the second day, he showed up late. His teacher took him outside. She told him he was smart, but that he was wasting his potential . The talk inspired him and he planned to prove that he could be anything if he worked hard enough. Adults at a summer program helped Derrius find out about scholarships he could earn to pay for college. In his senior year, Derrius filled out lots of applications. He told his friends, ""You're not going to see me for a long time."" Derrius's hard work paid off. He won more than $1 million in scholarships! He has a lot to be proud of. But he's most proud of helping others. Derrius gives speeches to teens, telling them how to find scholarships. In high school, Derrius got help buying a computer. He wanted to help others who needed them. Last year, he gave two laptops to high school students. There's a lot of work in his future. Derrius doesn't mind -- hard work has got him where he is today. He knows can take him anywhere."	['was encouraged a lot by his biology teacher']
What can we learn from the passage?	"A lot of people today are used to working, going on holiday, and having money---but many of them aren't happy. Yet other people seem to be really happy , even if they are poor. Why? Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, from the University of Chicago, has interviewed thousands of people who have a happy life to find out how they do it. ""I've been studying happiness for over 30 years,"" he says. ""My interest in the subject came from my own experience as a child during World War II , when I saw many adults destroyed by the terrible events. But there were always a few who kept their courage, helped others, and were able to give a sense of purpose and meaning to their lives. I wanted to find out how a person could build a fulfilling and enjoyable life."" In general, his research showed that people were unhappy doing nothing. The professor stresses that happy people didn't waste time, either at work or when they are free. ""Many people feel that the time they spend at work or at school is wasted. But often their free time is also wasted. Many people are used to doing passive things----watching television, for example----without using any skills. As a result, life goes past in a series of boring experiences."" But it doesn't have to be this way. The professor has found that people are happy when get into something he calls ""flow"". When people get very involved in a task that they have chosen, and which is well-defined and challenging , they experience ""flow"", a state where they don't notice time passing. They also experience enjoyment. Professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, makes a contrast between enjoyment and pleasure. ""I used to think they were the same thing---- but they're not! Pleasure is a big bowl of ice cream, or taking a hot bath on a cold day ---nothing bad at all! But enjoyment is about doing something and achieving something. It isn't really important what we do, it's more important to do something, and feel positive about it, and to try to do it well."" People who are not used to happiness can learn how to be happy, says the professor, if they constantly get into ""flow"" states. Is happiness as easy as that? Perhaps it is."

The biggest challenge for most mothers is from _ .	"Across Britain,burnt toast will be served to mothers in bed this morning as older sons and daughters rush to deliver their supermarket bunches of flowers.But,according to a new study,we should be placing a higher value on motherhood all year. Mothers have long known that their home workload was just as heavy as paid work.Now,the new study has shown that if they were paid for their parental labours,they would earn as much asPS172,000 a year. The study looked at the range of jobs mothers do,as well as the hours they are working,to determine the figure.This would make their yearly incomePS30,000 more than the Prime Minister earns. By analysing the numbers,it found the average mother works 119 hours a week,40 of which would usually be paid at a standard rate and 79 hours as overtime.After questioning 1,000 mothers with children under 18,it found that,on most days,mums started their routine work at 7 am and finished at around 11 pm. To calculate just how much mothers would earn from that labour,it suggested some of the roles that mums could take on,including housekeeper,part-time lawyer,personal trainer and entertainer.Being a part-time lawyer,atPS48.98 an hour,would prove to be the most profitable of the""mum jobs"",with psychologist a close second. It also asked mothers about the challenges they face,with 80 percent making emotional demand as the hardest thing about motherhood. Over a third of mums felt they needed more training and around half said they missed going out with friends. The study shows mothers matter all year long and not just on Mother's Day.The emotional,physical and mental energy mothers devote to their children can be never-ending,but children are also sources of great joy and happiness.Investing in time for parenting and raising relationships is money well spent."

Over the last century, in Western countries _ .	"There can be no doubt about the positive changes that have taken place in the last hundred yeas. In Western countries we eat more nutritiously, we are wealthier, we are healthier and there are more opportunities. But then, why, in the midst of so much excitement and opportunity, has life satisfaction declined so much? Why is depression the most common illness in the Western world? And why, when most infectious diseases have been conquered and rates of heart attacks and stokes have been reduced, do so many people report that they are feeling ill? It is argued that ""functional illnesses"" such as constant tiredness, the inability to sleep and anxiety that makes you ill, are caused by the body's failure to adapt to social change. Modern life is exhausting because we are often compelled to live by its standards, even though technically we have a choice to live otherwise. Everybody thought we would benefit from the invention of machines to carry out the more dull tasks in our life, leaving us many more opportunities for leisure and relaxation. And yet the opposite has happened. Only recently a lifestyle survey found that for 42% of its 5,000 interviewees, lack of sleep was their principal health concern, followed by 34% worrying about general exhaustion. A quarter acknowledged experiencing stress and depression. Working long hours in companies with a restricted social life is threatening our health and people feel unable to cope. The new technological age that claims freedom by allowing us greater flexibility is, in fact, slowly working to destroy us. Jobs for the whole life are an old story. If people take time out to recover, somebody else will come along to fill their position. Who, in this current every-man-for-himself climate, wants their employer to think they cannot cope, especially when there are mortgages and families at stake?"	['infectious diseases have declined']
Which of the following is TRUE ?	A painting by Chinese artist Qi Baishi set a record for modern art andcalligraphy on the mainland when it sold for 425.5 millionyuanat anauction on May 22. The sale was a milestone in the auction of modern and contemporary artworks. The price meant its value had risen more than 2,000 per cent in six years . The work ,Eagle standing on pine tree with four-character coupleti , measures about 2.6 metres by 1 metre . It was the second highest price paid for an artwork on the mainland . A Song dynasty work by Huang Tingjian was sold for 436.8 millionyuanin 2010 . Qi's painting was finished in 1946 when Qi was 86 , and was his largest work . With a starting price of 88 millionyuan, it attracted nearly 50bids in half an hour . Shanghai businessman Liu Yiqian said that the work had belonged to him and had cost less than 20 millionyuanin 2005 . The auction company said the work was brought back to the mainland after being bought from a private owner in San Francisco six years ago . China ranked first in global art sales last year , ahead of the United States and Britain . Four Chinese artists were among the top 10 in worldwide sales : Qi Baishi , Zhang Daqian , Xu Beihong and Fu Baoshi . Qi's works ranked second in sales to Pablo Picasso's last year . Qi was born into a peasant family in Hunan in 1864 . He taught himself to paint and focused on nature including plants , insects , birds and fish . He is mostly well-known for his paintings of shrimps . In 1953 , he was elected president of the Association of Chinese Artists . He died in Beijing in 1957 .

When the writer got hurt in a car accident, _ .	"Mike was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always happy and always had something interesting to say. If someone asked him how he was doing, he would reply, ""Couldn't be better!"" He was really a care-free young man and never felt tired. Mike used to say, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 'Mike, you have two choices today. You can choose to be happy or you can choose to be upset.' I choose to be happy. Each time something happens, I am always ready to learn a good lesson. I choose to learn from life."" I tried to understand what he said. Indeed life is all about choices. Every situation is a choice. The bottom line is: You're living your life and you make it either happy or sad. Several years later I had a car accident and my legs were seriously injured. When I was lying on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or choose to die. I chose to live. People like to say, ""Choose the one you love and love the one you choose."" Why not choose the one we love and live happily?"	['he chose to live']
. If the Chinese government is to develop nuclear power, it needs to _ .	The State Council declared Wednesday it would restart China's nuclear power program, ending the hiatus in nuclear construction since Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster last year. China has been the most courageous country in building nuclear power, with the largest number of plants currently under construction. Nuclear power is facing a tough time in developed countries. The Japanese public is demanding the closure of all the country's nuclear power plants. China is at the forefront of nuclear power development. But it has been forced into this position. Rapid economic development coupled with improvements in people's life both demand more electricity. It is impossible to exploit fossil resources forever as the supply of coal, oil and natural gas is limited. China has no choice but to develop nuclear power. China must be the safest user of nuclear power. It should become a leading country in developing nuclear power technologies and increasing the world's knowledge of nuclear power. It needs to do at least two things. First, it needs to promote safety in nuclear power plants, based on the technologies of the West. The former Soviet Union, the US and Japan all had severe nuclear accidents, proving there are risks. China should try to remove these risks. Second, China should establish effective communication mechanisms between the government, power plants and the public. It's wrong to think the government can control every aspect of nuclear power plant construction. The opposition to nuclear power program in developed countries has prevented them from building new plants, but they already have many. These governments are reluctant to close these plants despite strong opposition, because they cannot find better substitutes. Nuclear power only occupies 1.8 percent of China's current electricity grid , much lower than the proportion in many developed countries. China's nuclear power plan should introduce the advantages of the technologies of other countries and also be creative in providing security. Its space technology is not the most advanced, but its launch safety measures have proven to be among the best. China's high-profile high-speed railway development has drawn a lot of controversy, as will the active attitude towards developing nuclear power. But China cannot just copy what the developed countries have done. The development of nuclear power must be unique to China and it must be a ground-breaking success. But now, the real test lies ahead.	['do everything in its power to guarantee safety in nuclear power plants']
Mary invited Julie to her party _ .	"Mary's mother waited for her in the car. Mary knew that she would be late if she didn't hurry , but she didn't care. It is her birthday today. Ten minutes later, Mary opened the car door. Her mother said, ""Don't forget to go home with Cindy today."" Mary felt a little disappointed . She really hoped to have a party today, but her mother had to work late tonight. She promised Mary that they could have a party next week. ""I won't forget,"" replied Mary. When she arrived at school, she got out of the car and said goodbye to her mother. It seemed that her mother didn't care. Mary walked into the school.

What would be the best title for the passage?	"American actress Marisa Tomei won an Academy Award for her work in the 1992 movie My Cousin Vinny. People laughed when they saw her film character telling a boyfriend that they need to get married. Why marriage? Because her biological clock is ticking and she wants a baby. ""Well I hate to bring it up because I know you got enough pressure on you already. But...we agreed to get married as soon as you won your first case(law case). Meanwhile, ten years later...my niece...the daughter of my sister is getting married. My biological clock is ticking like this (stomp, stomp, stomp). And the way this case is going...I ain't never getting married."" ""Lisa, I don't need this. I swear to God I don't need this right now."" Using it this way, a biological clock means the time in a woman's life when she is able to bear children. In the not-so-distant past, most people thought that when a woman reached her 40s it was too late for her to have children. The time on her biological clock had run out. Well, that has changed. These days some women are resetting their biological clocks. They are giving themselves more time to have children. Make no mistake. Being a ""Single Mother by Choice"" is very different from younger women who find themselves pregnant, perhaps not by choice. Generally speaking, single mothers by choice are older and well educated. They are usually financially secure and successful in their careers. So, they have the money. What they may not have is a partner. This is the place in life where writer Kerry Reichs found herself several years ago. She says she did not plan to become a single mother. She says she just did not find the right partner. ""Well, I think I had a set of standards for the partner I was looking for and I didn't meet anyone that fit those standards. And, at 39 I found myself single, without children and I wanted them very much. So, I made the difficult decision that I could do this on my own."	['Choosing to be a single mother.']
The National Coalition for the homeless believes that the number of homeless children is _ .	"Until the 1980s, the American homeless population comprised mainly older males. Today, homelessness strikes much younger part of society. In fact, a 25-city survey by the U. S. Conference of Mayors in 1987 found that families with children make up the fastest growing part of the homeless population. Many homeless children gather in inner cities; this transient and frequently frightened student population creates additional problems -- both legal and educational -- for already overburdened urban school administrators and teachers. Estimates of the number of homeless Americans range from 350,000 to three million. Likewise, estimates of the number of homeless school children vary radically. A U.S. Department of Education report, based on state estimates, states that there are 220,000 homeless school-age children, about a third of whom do not attend school on a regular basis, But the National Coalition for the Homeless estimates that there are at least two times as many homeless children, and that less than half of them attend school regularly. One part of the homeless population that is particularly difficult to count consists of the ""throwaway"" youths who have been cast of their homes. The Elementary School Center in New York City estimates that there are 1.5 million of them, many of whom are not counted as children because they do not stay in family shelters and tend to live by themselves on the streets. Federal law, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, includes a section that addresses the educational needs of homeless children. The educational provisions of the McKinney Act are based on the belief that all homeless children have the right to a free, appropriate education."	['440,000']
The government is passing laws to restrict teen driving because _ .	"Have you ever been offered an alcoholic drink? What about someone saying ""Don't worry, just have one little sip""? Most people have their first drink by the time they're 13. That first drink can be the start of a troubled life. Drinking can make teens feel good, but that lasts only a short time. Alcohol clouds your brain and limits your ability to make decisions. Excessive drinking gradually makes your brain shrink and can cause serious damage. Over-drinking can cause learning disabilities and damage your memory. It distorts your vision and leads to blackouts. Teenagers often think that drinking will give you more energy, but alcohol isn't an energy drink; it's a depressant. Drinking and driving is one of the top causes of death for teen boys. An alcohol-related motor vehicle crash kills one person every 33 minutes and injures someone every two minutes. The rate of teenagers driving drunk is so high that the government is trying to pass new laws restricting teen driving. When we get to high school, friends start pressuring us to drink. High school students see alcohol as glamorous and a way to become popular. I created a survey at my school. Twenty-four of the 63 respondents predicted they would drink in high school. Eleven said maybe, and 28 said they don't plan on drinking. Regardless of what they say now, things can change. Teens starting high school want to fit in. Some people will do anything to be accepted, including potentially(,) hurting themselves. They think that one drink won't do anything. A little bit of alcohol probably won't kill you, but it can lead to poor decisions. High school is the time to experiment with what you want to do in life, but if you're experimenting with alcohol you could hurt someone, including yourself.

We can draw a conclusion from the passage that _ .	"A yoga master made a shocking statement that Abraham Lincoln had been a Himalayan yogi in a past life.Lincoln delivered a proclamation setting up Thanksgiving as an American holiday in 1863.Research throws light on a possible Hindu origin for the American celebration of Thanksgiving. ""The holiday of Thanksgiving has a Hindu origin,"" says Richard Salva, author of a book on the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln entitled Soul Journey: From Lincoln to Lindbergh which is based on a statement by the great master of yoga, Paramhamsa Yogananda, who declared that Abraham Lincoln had been a Himalayan yogi in a past life, and that he was reborn as the famous pilot, Charles Lindbergh. ""During my search for signs of a past-life yoga practice,"" SaIva said, ""I noticed that President Lincoln repeatedly chose Thursdays as national days of prayer, fasting ,and thanksgiving.This was interesting, because Thursday is considered a holy day -- a day for prayer, fasting, and spiritual reflection -- among Hindus, who call it ""guru day""."" ""Lincoln also set aside time on Thursdays to grieve for his son,Willie, who died in Washington.Clearly, Thursdays had a spiritual significance in Lincoln's mind. In his book, Richard Salva presents more than 500 connections between Lincoln, Lindergh, and the ancient spiritual science of yoga. The connections run through every aspect of the human condition and provide convincing evidence that Lincoln had had a Hindu past life. More than one out of every five Americans today believes in reincarnation--yet few are aware of how past-life patterns affect them. Soul Journey tries to fill this gap, by offering a substitute experience of reincarnation. Through clear and persuasive similarities between the lives of Lincoln and Lindbergh, the book discovers how the hidden laws of fate and reincarnation impact the events of his or her daily life. It addresses other issues, such as the secret spiritual history of America's greatest president, including his past life as a Himalayan yogi; the hidden clues that reveal past lives; the greatness he achieved; and the spiritual principles behind the yoga postures that millions now practice."

Which of following is not TRUE according to the passage?	Have you ever seen people building houses? To build a house , you need workers. They use their hands , tools and machines to put things together. Building the ISS is the same. The difference is that the workers are astronauts. They walk in space and use robots' arms and hands to do their work. In the space station ,astronauts are comfortable. The temperature there is about 21degC.But outside the station , it can be too hot or cold for people. In the sunlight, it's about 120degC. In the shadow of the station, it's about -85degC . So when astronauts walk in space , they have to wear heavy clothes---- _ s. Spacesuits also keep astronauts safe from flying rubbish in space.Each time people go into space , they leave rubbish there. So astronauts should be careful because there's a lot of rubbish, some rubbish goes many times as fast as a plane ! Space walking is not easy , and it can be dangerous. So getting ready for it takes a lot of time to learn. Astronauts will need to do 160 space walks to finish their work in the ISS. That will take about 1,900man-hour of work.

If we want to learn English well, we can _ .	QQ is one of the most popular chat tools among teenagers. We regard it as an important chat tool in our dailylife because it has some advantages. First, we can make lots of e-friends on QQ. It is easy to find the person who has the same interest as us, and we can talk with him or her happily. Second, we can also join a QQ group to find the information we need. For example, if we want to learn English well, we can choose a group with many English lovers in it. Third, we can also play games with our friends on QQ and always have fun. QQ brings us a lot of benefits , but it can also cause some problems. It's dangerous to tell strangers on QQ our real personal information like telephone number, address and ID number.

Earlier in the old days, women used to do the following EXCEPT _ .	Earlier, in the old days, women used to sit at home separated from the outside world. They used to manage the home and look after children. They were free of the responsibility of earning money to support the family, which was left to men. With the coming of industrialization and technological development, the lifestyles of human beings started to change. The needs of human beings started to grow. In this process, women slowly started to move outside the home. Women received the same education as men. Gradually, women slowly started to think independently and participated equally with men in all fields of life, including politics, sports and even military. With changing environments, the role of women has become more important in society. To match today's standard of living, it is necessary for both men and women to support the family. Today, women have been given bigger roles to play in society. They are even taking more responsibility than men. At first, men disagreed with women pursuing their careers outside the home. However, with growing needs and a shortage of money, they had no other way but to accept the reality. The financial contributions from women to their families have increased, but in some places, the home is still managed only by women as in the past. It is a challenging task for women to manage both. Women are bearing the stress and suffering mental difficulties with both managing the home and pursuing their careers.	['make money for the family']
What message does the writer want to convey?	"My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was. We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman. Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex. On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action. My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful. I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me. It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices. I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women. I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures. Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of."	['Women should face their diseases bravely.']

We can know from the passage that _ .	"My father had returned from his business visit to prefix = st1 /Londonwhen I came in, rather late for supper. I could tell at once that he and my mother had been discussing something. In that half-playful, half-serious way I knew so well, he said,""How would you like to go to Eton?"" ""You bet. "" I cried quickly catching the joke. Everyone knew it was the most expensive, the most famous of schools. You should be entered at birth, if not before. I understood my father. He disliked any form of showing off. He always knew his proper station in life, which was in the middle of the middle class; our house was medium-sized; he had avoided joining Royal Liverpool Golf Club and went to a smaller one instead; though once he had got a second-hand Rolls-Royce at a remarkably low price, he felt embarrassed driving it, and quickly changed it for an Austin 1100. This could only be his delightful way of telling me that the whole boarding school idea was to be dropped. Alas! I should also have remembered that he had a liking for being different from everyone else, if it did not conflict with his fear of drawing attention to himself. It seemed that he had happened to be talking to Graham Brown of the London office, a very nice fellow, and Graham had a friend who had just entered his boy at the school, and while he was in that part of the world , my father thought he might just as well phone them. I remember my eyes stinging and my hands shaking with the puzzlement of my feelings. There was excitement, at the heart of great sadness. ""Oh, he doesn't want to go away. "" said my mother. ""You shouldn't go on like this. "" ""It's up to him. "" said my father. ""He can make up his own mind."""	['Every family can not afford to send children to study at Eton']
Mr. Gao ran his car into three other cars because _ .	"On the night of May 9, 2011, musician Gao Xiaosong ran his car into three other cars in Beijing. But it wasn't just a car accident--he was drunk . Now, Gao has to go to prison for six months and pay a 4,000 yuan fine. Gao is the first star to be punished under China's new drunk driving law. From May 1 on, drunk drivers will pay a fine, and be banned from driving for five years or even forever. Drunk driving has become a serious social problem in China.According to the Ministry of Public Security , police caught more than half a million drunk drivers last year, a 68 % increase from 2009. The new law sees drunk driving as a crime. In the West, drunk driving is also a crime. In the US, for example, if the police catch a drunk driver, the driver will pay a fine, lose his or her license and even go to prison. If the driver wants to drive again, he or she must do public service, and take part in educational programs. You may think: drunk driving is a crime? Isn't this law too unkind? But experts say, ""Not at all."" ""It is to protect people's rights to life and health,"" Li Gang, lawyer in Chengdu, told China Daily. ""Drunk driving is very dangerous. No matter what the results are, it should not be allowed."""	['he drank too much wine']
When you meet a group of people, it is better to remember _ .	"Remembering names is an important social skill . Here are some ways to improve it. Remember and repeat in conversation . When you hear a person's name , repeat it. Immediately say it to yourself several times without moving your lips . you could also repeat the name in a way that sounds natural. Ask the other person to recite and repeat . You can let other people help you remember their names. After you've been introduced to someone , ask that person to spell the name and pronounce it correctly for you . Most people will be glad by the effort that you're making to learn their names. Admit that you don't know .You may tell them that you can't remember someone's name . Most of them will feel glad if you say, ""I'm working to remember your names better . Yours is right on the tip of my tongue . What is it again?"" Use associations . Link each person yon meet with one thing you find interesting or unusual. For example, you can remember in this way : ""Vicki Cheng ----tall, black hair."" To remember their names , you can write them on a small card as soon as possible. Limit the number of new names you learn at one time. When meeting a group of people, you'd better remember just two or three names. Free yourself from remembering every one. Few of the people expect you to remember their names. Another way is to limit yourself to learning just first names. Last names can come later. Go early . Consider going early to meetings , parties and classes . Sometimes just a few people show up on time . There're fewer names for you to remember. And as more people arrive , you can hear them being introduced to others ."	['a few names first']
Before we began to use paper to make chairs, tables and beds, _ .	When we think of paper, we think of newspapers and books. But there are many other uses. Only half of the world's paper is used for books and newspapers. Paper is very good for keeping you warm. You have perhaps seen homeless men asleep on a large number of newspapers. In Finland, it is sometimes - 40degC in winter. The farmers wear paper boots in the snow. Nothing could be warmer. Each year, more and more things are made of paper. We have had paper cups and plates for a long time. But now we hear that chairs, tables, and even beds can be made of paper. With paper boots and shoes, you can also wear paper hats, paper dresses, and paper raincoats. When you have used them once, you throw them away and buy new ones. The latest use of paper seems to be paper houses. These are not small houses for children to play in, but real, big houses for people to live in. You can buy a house with three rooms for about 500 dollars. You can put it up by yourself in a few hours, and you can use it for about five years.	['we had already had paper cups and plates']

"In""perfect weather"", _ ."	"Weather has a strong effect on people. It influences health, intelligence and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a""perfect weather""for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity . Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason."

What's Lone's first reaction when she got close to the men?	"On a Friday night in May 2015, Oliver and Lone Kleven heard angry shouts coming from their front lawn. Lone, 68, stepped onto the porch and saw two men in dark clothes struggling with something on the ground--right where she and her grandson had planted a flower bed the weekend before. ""Go fight somewhere else!"" she shouted, worried her plants would get damaged. At the sound of her voice, the face of a boy appeared from beneath the two men. He looked 13 or 14 or so. ""They're trying to kill me!"" the boy screamed. Lone ran toward them and, without hesitation, caught the boy's arm, pulling him out. ""Leave _ alone!"" she shouted. When the men stood up, Lone saw what looked like a sharp object in one man's hand. When she turned back toward the boy, he was moaning in pain and holding his stomach. The attackers began to move in on the boy again when Lone's husband shouted: ""Get lost!"" The two men walked quickly and quietly across the street and drove off in a dark car. ""I have to get to the hospital!"" the boy cried. He lifted his shirt, and Lone could see a bloody wound on his stomach. Oliver hugged the trembling boy while Lone caught her cell phone and car keys inside the house. She handed the phone to Oliver. ""Call 911,"" she told him. ""I'm going after them."" Lone took off but was unable to find the car. The Klevens then learned what had happened. Earlier that night, as the boy waited for his parents to pick him up from the high school across the street from the Klevens' house, two men approached and demanded his wallet. When he refused, one of the men hit him in the face. The boy ran across the street. The men caught up with him, and one hurt him in the back and stomach with a sharp knife. That's when Lone stepped in. The boy's wounds required operations, but he has fully recovered. ""He was alone and outnumbered,"" says Lone. ""There was no time to do anything except what I did."""

What is the report from?	Here is a report from Xinghua Daily Newspaper. Computer games are very popular not only with the young people but also the adults. In some ways, they will take the place of the traditional games such as cards, chess and so on. Because you only need a computer to play computer games. But in the past, if a man wanted to play chess, he must look for another one. In fact, computer games themselves are so interesting and exciting for us. The games can bring you happiness and excitement. They have been used in too many places such as schools, business, hospitals and so on. Now there are many educational games for the students. They are helpful to the students. They can make the students learn more and better by changing the study ways. When the students play the educational games, they use their brains, eyes, ears and hands. The students will be active to get knowledge while playing. But now the students shouldn't spend too much time on the computer games. Otherwise, it may _ their study. We have gone into the computer age. And learning too much knowledge through the computer is becoming true.	['Newspaper.']

Which of the following may be the best title of this passage?	Why should ear, nose, tongue and eyes be called special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we maintain contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connections. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a heavy meal, but the hearing pitch does change after that. We usually owe it to our tongue that we have taste, but do you know that unless saliva dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something. Woman are much better smellers than man. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly make out the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different scents, which are strongly tied to the memories. Pupils do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a very delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can enlarge their pupils, change the focus and make them see less clearly. Each and every one of us has an individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except for the identical twins. This smell isn't very noticeable yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this scent that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around. Many of us can point out the smell of our significant friends and colleagues. This is guided, to a great degree, by genetics but it is also influenced by the environment, diet and so on. This all together creates the unique chemistry that is individualistic for each person.

The practice of the Olympic Flame has been carried on for about _ .	"The Olympic Flame from the ancient games was reintroduced during the 1928 Olympic Games. An employee of the Electric Utility of Amsterdam, lit the first Olympic flame in the Marathon Tower of theOlympic Stadiuminprefix = st1 /Amsterdam. The modern practice of moving the Olympic Flame via a relay system from Olympia to the Olympic venue began with the 1936 Summer OlympicsinBerlin,Germany. The relay, captured in Leni Riefenstahl'sfilm, ""Olympia"", was part of the Nazi propaganda machine's attempt to add myth and mystique to Adolf Hitler's regime. Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classicalGreecewas an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich. Although most of the time the torch with the Olympic Flame is still carried by runners, it has been transported in many different ways. The fire traveled by boat in 1948 to cross the English Channel, and it was first transported byairplanein 1952, when the fire traveled toHelsinki. All carriers in the torch relay toStockholm, where these events were held instead, traveled on horseback. Remarkable means of transportation were used in 1976, when the flame was transformed to a radio signal. From Athens, this signal was transmitted bysatellitetoCanada, where it was received and used to trigger alaserbeam to re-light the flame. In 2000, the torch was carried under water by divers near theGreat Barrier Reef. Other unique means of transportation include aNative Americancanoe, acamel, andConcorde. In2004, the first global torch relay was undertaken, a journey that lasted 78 days. The Olympic flame covered a distance of more than 78,000 km in the hands of some 11,300 torchbearers, traveling to Africa and South America for the first time, visiting all previous Olympic cities and finally returning toAthensfor the2004 Summer Olympics. Another means of catching attention has been the lighting of the fire in the stadium. At the 1992 Barcelona Games,ParalympicarcherAntonio Rebolloshot a burning arrow over the cauldron from a platform at the opposite end of the stadium. Two years later, the Olympic fire was brought into the stadium ofLillehammerby aski jumper."	['72 years']

In writing the passage, the author intends to _ .	"Chinese female scientist Tu Youyou won the 2015 Nobel Prize in medicine on October 5 for her discoveries concerning a novel treatment against Malaria . This is the first Nobel Prize given to a Chinese scientist for work carried out within ChinA. Tu shared the prize with Irish-born William Campbell and Satoshi Omura of Japan, who were honored for their revolutionary anti-roundworm treatment. 84-year-old Tu is awarded this prize for her contribution to cutting the death rate of malaria, reducing patients' suffering and promoting mankind's health. Although she received several medical awards in the past, the 2015 Nobel Prize is definitely the most privilege reward that recognizes Tu's dedication and perseverance in discovering artemisinin , the key drug that battles malaria-friendly parasites . However, her route to the honor has been anything but traditional. She won the Nobel Prize for medicine, but she doesn't have a medical degree or a Phd. In China, she is even being called the ""three-noes"" winner: no medical degree, no doctorate, and she's never worked overseas. No wonder her success has stirred China's national pride and helped promote confidence of native Chinese scientists. The fact that Tu has none of these three backgrounds reminds us that science should be more accessible to all. One shall be able to become a scientist no matter what kind of background he or she comes from, as long as one dives into scientific research. There have been discussions on people who really love science but are never able to achieve much during their whole life. Their contributions can never be ignored. They work so hard to prove the wrong way so that the future researchers will be closer to the right one. As the first Chinese mainland Nobel Prize Winner of natural science award, Tu's record-breaking winning also serves as a reminder to those who are too eager for instant success. Science is never about instant success. Tu spent decades on scientific research before its value is officially acknowledged. There is no way to measure how much one devotes to science and compare it with how much reward he or she may get."	['inform readers of the news and make comments']
What can be inferred from the text?	The loneliest chimp in the world just got the best surprise--a hug from a new friend. Ponso has been by himself for nearly three years, finding himself alone after his wife and children died on the island where they were abandoned by a medical testing company many years ago. For years a nearby villager named Germain has been Ponso's only company, visiting him so often to bring bananas and bread--the chimp's only source of food on the tiny island. It was clear how much Ponso missed companionship when he was recently visited by Chimpanzee Conservation Centre Director Estelle Raballand. The chimp immediately embraced Estelle Raballand in a huge hug and laughed as she reached out for him, with his smile from ear to ear. For those who know Ponso's backstory, his immediate ease and trust in humans might be surprising. Ponso was one of 20 chimps, all between the ages of 7 to 11 years old, relocated to an island off the Ivory Coast after being used for testing by the New York Blood Centre. After the tests were completed in 2005, the lab reportedly transferred the chimps to a string of islands, occasionally dropping off food and water because there was none in the chimps'new homes. Disease and hunger soon left only Ponso, his mate and their two children standing. But at the end of 2013 they died within days of each other and Ponso was now completely alone. A group called SOS PONSO is trying to raise money for the poor lonely chimp, already achieving its goal of e 20, 000-all of which will be used for Ponso's care.

Which of the following girl names ranks the second?	"Olivia and Jack are the most popular names in Britain for babies born in 2008, according to a survey made by the website . Jack has been top for 14 years since it took over from Thomas. Grace -- made famous by the Hollywood star Grace Kelly -- slipped back into third place behind Ruby, the name of singer Charlotte Church's daughter. Summer climbed 28 places from 44th to 16th. Ava -- the name of singer Myleene Klass's daughter -- also leapt 15 places to 19th. The troubles of the singer Amy Winehouse perhaps had an effect on the popularity of the name. It dropped three places to 23rd. Rebecca is also on the wane , ranking 48th. So is Courtney, which ranked 88th. Theo, obviously inspired by England's teenage football hero Theo Walcott, is among the biggest climbers in the boy's list, rising from 70th to 58th. An employee of said, ""Baby names have witnessed the biggest changes over the last decade as parents are increasingly influenced by celebrities. The Bounty baby name poll also shows parents are continuing to be creative and inspirational about the names they choose for their children. Some parents want a name that's totally unique, and names such as Zebedee, Selim and Zenon are now emerging and growing in popularity. Others are simply breaking with convention and becoming bolder in their choice of names.""

Traditional royal names continue to be supreme in the boys' top 100,"" The employee said."	['Ruby.']
Which of the following is TRUE about his illness?	"Many years ago, Norman Cousins was seriously ill. He was given six months to live. His chance for recovery was 1 in 500. He could see the worry, depression and anger in his life contributed to his disease. He wondered, ""If illness can be caused by negativity , can health be created by positivity ?"" He decided to make an experiment of himself. Laughing was one of the most positive activities he knew. He watched all the funny movies he could find. He read funny stories. He asked his friends to call him whenever they said, heard or did something interesting. His pain was so great that he could not sleep. Laughing for 10 solid minutes, he found, relieved the pain for several hours so he could sleep. He fully recovered from his illness and lived another 20 happy and healthy years. Laughing is necessary to our health. If we're not well, laughing helps us get well; if we are well, laughing helps us stay that way. So, if you like laughing, do it as often as you can. Use whatever makes you laugh--movies, books, jokes or friends. The people around you may think you're strange, but sooner or later they'll join in even if they don't know what you're laughing about."

We can learn from the passage that _ smoking.	I'm glad to find this comment which has some sort of support in this quest I have to eat raw foods. I'm an unhealthy 49 years old and have come to the conclusion that it's now or never, so I am taking a dive into the raw eating lifestyle. I have to cook for my family and prepare what they want to eat. I'm trying to plan out this better so I have some of these unusual foods ready for myself. I've read several books written by Ann Wigmore and like her approach to the living foods. Last week I attempted fasting and failed. I lasted five days by having carrots, spinach, apples and other vegetarian diets I could get my hands on. I was doing fine until I drank some coffee. I kind of proved it in my mind to have the coffee but it only made me excited and then I couldn't sleep well and felt hungry and weak. So I stopped and went back to the old way of eating with the family. This week I started to make a drink called rejuvelac made of sprouted wheat . This is fairly new to do for me and the drink smelled sort of musty and tasted kind of like a musty lemon. The kids tasted it and almost threw up but surprisingly it tasted good to me. It is supposed to help in digestion . I've made some attempts to grow wheat grass. I think I have figured that out as long as I keep it away from birds and our horses. I have two habits to get rid of, drinking coffee and smoking. I quit smoking last month but something happened, so I started up again. I'm very frustrated with the smoking and really have a desire to quit for good. Anyhow I will keep this updated on my progress.	"[""it's hard for the author to quit""]"
It is often difficult to get correct information on campus crime because some colleges _ .	"Last August, Joe and Mary Mahoney began looking at colleges for their 17-year-old daughter, Maureen. With a checklist of criteria in hand, the Dallas family looked around the country visiting half a dozen schools. They sought a university that offered the teenager's intended major, one located near a large city, and a campus where their daughter would be safe. ""The safety issue is a big one,"" says Joe Mahoney, who quickly discovered he wasn't alone in his worries. On campus tours other parents voiced similar concerns, and the same question was always asked: what about crime? But when college officials always gave the same answer -----""That's not a problem here,""-----Mahoney began to feel uneasy. ""No crime whatever?"" comments Mahoney today. ""I just don't _ it."" Nor should he: in 1999 the U.S. Department of education had reports of nearly 400,000 serious crimes on or around our campuses. ""Parents need to understand that times have changed since they went to college,"" says David Nichols, author ofCreating a Safe Campus. ""Campus crime mirrors the rest of the nation."" But getting accurate information isn't easy. Colleges must report crime statistics by law, but some hold back for fear of bad publicity , leaving the honest ones looking dangerous. ""The truth may not always be serious,"" warns S. Daniel Carter of Security on Campus, Inc., the nation's leading campus safety watchdog group. To help concerned parents, Carter promised to visit campuses and talk to experts around the country to find out major crime issues and effective solutions."	['hide the truth of campus crime']
What's the Queen's secret weapon?	"Elizabeth's Second! In 60 years, the Queen has never put a foot wrong in public. And for the last 24 of them, it turns out she's had a secret weapon -- the nice Ella Slack. The former BBC manager has, unknown to anyone except a handful of key advisers, spent the last quarter of a century acting as the Queen's official stand-in at rehearsals for royal events. The 69-year-old has never accepted a penny for her royal service, considering it ""a pleasure and an honour"" to ensure that everything runs smoothly for the Queen. ""How many people in the world have had a chance to sit in a royal landau or walk onto the dais at Windsor Castle even before the Queen has done so?"" she said. While Miss Slack may not resemble the Queen facially, she has a similar figure to the Queen, standing just 5 foot. The Queen is 5 foot 2 inch. She began her remarkable role in 1988, when she was working as manager of the BBC's sports and events department. A producer asked her if she could stand in for the Queen to check camera angles at a rehearsal -- and her second career was born. Since then, from the State Opening of Parliament to the 50th anniversary of Victory day, wherever the Queen is on duty Miss Slack is likely to have been there first. She has perfected her own version of the Queen's clothes, including a black patent handbag she bought in a charity shop for PS1, and even styles her hair like the Queen."

By writing this article, the author mainly intends to show _ .	"Several hundred strangers received ""love letters"" from a young man on the street. The letter was written and given out by Yang Yang,a student majoring in human resources at Chongqing University of Science and Technology, who hoped to show his disappointment with job hunting. Yang's story has caught media attention perhaps because it is similar to those of millions of recent graduates seeking jobs and struggling for survival in the country's wealthiest cities. They have diplomas, rather than professional skills, and come to big cities in hopes of better lives, only to find low-paying jobs and poor living conditions. They are China's ""ant tribe "",a term coined by sociologist Lian Si from Peking University in his 2009 book, Ant Tribe.""They're so similar to ants. They share small and narrow living areas. They're intelligent and hardworking, yet nameless and underpaid.""The term also speaks to their helplessness in a world governed by the law of the jungle-only the strongest survive. A survey in Lian's another book published this year, Ant Tribe II, found nearly 30 percent of ""ants"" are graduates of famous universities-almost three times last year's percentage. Most had degrees in popular majors. In addition, 7.2 percent of ""ants"" have at least a master's degree compared to 1.6 percent in 2009. An ""ant's"" average monthly salary is 1,904 yuan, with about 64 percent of them earning less than 2,000 yuan a month. Another survey in the 2010 Annual Report on the Development of Chinese Talent found more than 1 million ""ants"" live in big cities. ""Most ants are from rural families or small towns, and their experiences in universities didn't arm them well enough to fight with competitors in big cities' employment markets.""Professor Zhang Ming at Renmin University of China said. The ""ant tribe's"" embarrassing living situations have become a serious social problem, and the government should develop smaller cities to attract more graduates from big cities, Zhang believed. However, ""ants"" expect more study and training opportunities in big cities, which keeps them positive despite their situations."	"['despite better education,""ants"" are still struggling']"
. From the passage we know that _ .	Imagine the situation. You are driving along a desert or on a mountain. You have no idea where you are. You passed the last house two hours ago. Then your car breaks down. It is night and it is cold. You have no mobile phone. What do you do? Well, next time take a GPS with you. This invention may be able to help you. It is a device which uses satellites to find the user's position. It can find your position in 20 meters. A GPS can't start your car, but at least you will know where you are. GPS, which means Global Positioning System, is a small radio receiver. It looks like a mobile phone. You can hold it in your hand, or put it in your pocket. It is sometimes put into a watch or a telephone. We also find GPS devices in cars, planes, or boats. Some of these devices have electronic maps, so you know where you are. For example, in a city they can tell you the name of the street. There are three parts to the Global Positioning System. The first part is the receiver. You can hold it in your hand, or have it fixed into your car, plane, etc. The second part is a group of satellites orbiting the earth. The receiver contacts at least four of the satellites and calculates its position. The third part of the system is a network of ground stations. They are all over the world. They control the satellites and make sure they are working well. Some people think that in the future the GPS will be as common as the mobile. They are becoming cheaper and more and more accurate . There are also many new uses for the GPS. Perhaps they will become like watches. Everyone will have one and you will never be lost again.

Why is David so different from other young people of his age?	"Computer programmer David Jones earned PS35,000 a year designing new computer games, yet he cannot find a bank prepared to let him have a check card, he has been told to wait another two years until he is 18. He works for a small firm in Liverpool, where most young people of his age are finding jobs. David's biggest headache is what to do with his money. Though he has high payment, he cannot drive a car, or get credit card . David got his job four months ago, a year after leaving school with six O-levels and working for a time in a computer shop. ""I got the job because the people who run the firm knew I had already written some programs,"" he said. ""I suppose PS35,000 sounds a lot but I hope it will come to more than that this year."" He spends some of his money on records and clothes, and gives his mother PS20 a week as he lives with his parents. But most of his spare time is spent working. ""Unfortunately, computing was not part of our studies at school, "" he said. ""But I had been studying it in books and magazines for four years in my spare time. I knew what I wanted to do and never considered staying on at school. Most people in this business are fairly young, anyway. I would like to earn a million and I suppose early retirement is a possibility. You never know when the market might disappear."""	['He earns an extremely high payment']
What is the author's opinion about the sudden change in teenage children?	"Recently a specialist in teenager studies does some research on teenage problems. He thinks parents shouldn't be blamed of themselves because there is nothing they can do to deal with the teenage problem. Whatever they do, sometimes a wonderful, kind and helpful child will turn into a terrible animal. I've seen friends deal with _ in all kinds of different ways. One strict mother insisted that her son, should stand up, open doors and shake hands like a gentleman whenever anyone entered the room. I saw him last week when I visited them. Lying on the sofa, he made no attempt to turn off the loud TV he was watching as I walked in. His mother was angry. ""I don't know what to do with him these days,"" she said. ""He's forgotten all the manners we taught him."" He hasn't forgotten them. He's just decided that he's not going to use them. She said that she would like to throw him down from the sofa onto the floor. Another good friend of mine let her two daughters climb all over the furniture, reach across the table, stare at me and say, ""I don't like your dress, it's ugly."" One of the daughters has recently been driven out of school. The other has left home. ""Where did we go wrong?"" Her parents are now very sad. Probably nothing is wrong with the parents."

Which word best describes Clay Dyer's personality?	"I was watching Sports center last night when one of those ""human interest"" stories came on and really caught my attention. The story was about a 27-year-old professional Bass Fisherman named Clay Dyer. At first, they played it off as another guy trying to make the cut on the Bass master tour until they showed a picture of him. No legs, no arm, or rather, he has only 1/3 of his right arm. That's all that he has. It was such an amazing story that I was wondering what this guy could do. Growing up, he learned to play baseball and basketball, but found that fishing was his true calling. And he does it all on his own. He holds the fishing pole under his chin and uses that and his stub arm to cast and reel in the fish. He uses his teeth to help him unhook fish. He ties his own hooks or lures on with his mouth, never really asking anyone else to help. Clay Dyer even knows how to swim. Since his body can't produce enough sweat on its own, he has to take a dip in the lake every few hours to keep cool. He dives in just like anyone else, then somehow treads water with his stub arm, then, with a little help, pulls himself back up into the boat and goes on fishing. Clay Dyer has never looked for others' pity, nor has he allowed his physical disabilities to prevent him from becoming a professional fisherman. His motto for life is ""If I can, you can."" He refuses to use special equipment, saying, ""I want to do it with one hand the way they do it with two."""	['Inspiring.']
Where would this passage most probably appear?	"""What's the name of our neighbor? I can't remember right now. "" Have you ever heard your grandparents ask questions like this sometimes? Usually, we think that older people's memory becomes bad because their brains get weak. But now a team of scientists at the University of Tubingen in Germany has a new idea.[ ""The human brain works slower in old age,"" says Michael Ramscar, the lead scientist. ""But only because they have stored more information overtime. "" The findings are based on a series of computer simulations of learning and memory. Scientists let the computers read a certain amount of words and learn new things each day. When the computer ""reads"" only so much, its performance on cognitive tests is similar of a young adult. But if the computer learns the experiences we might encounter over a lifetime, its performance is similar to that of an older adult. Often it is slower, but not because its processing capacity has declined. Rather, increased ""experience"" has caused the computer's database to grow, giving it more data to process-which takes time. This is similar to old people. Imagine a person knows two people's birthdays. Another person knows the birthdays of 2000 people, but can only match the right person to the right birthday nine times out of 10. Can you say the first person has a better memory than the second person?"	['In a magazine.']
The passage mainly tell us _	Beach volleyball is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people in each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get a lot of running for the ball after each volley . If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard surface, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a court. When an athlete trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body strength. Strengthening his legs is extremely important. This improves the player's ability to move quickly and accurately on sand despite the resistance. The ability to jump high and land without injury is necessary for beach volleyball players. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be extremely exciting and fun. You may start out with friends and may soon fall in love with the sport.	['how to become a good beach volleyball player']
Observation of the same person by two people at the same time may differ because _ .	"When several different people look at the same person,it's not unusual for each of them to see different things;when you alone observe one behavior or one person at two different times,you may see different things.The following are but some of the factors that lead to these changing perceptions .

(2)Sometimes perceptions differ because of what we choose to observe and how we deal with what we've observed.It is not necessarily true that person's perception is based on observations of a particular person.Your observations may be totally controlled by what others have told you about this person;or you may focus primarily on the situation or role relationship.Most people do not use the same yardstick to measure their parents,their friends and strangers. (3)Sometimes we see only what we want to see or don't see what may be obvious to others because of our own needs,desires,or temporary emotional states.This is a process known as selective perception.Selective perception is obviously more difficult when contradictory information is particularly obvious,but it can be done.We can ignore the "" _ "".He's basically a good boy so what I saw was not shoplifting.

In the end, Adam understood that _ .	"One afternoon, my son came home from school and asked me, ""Are all people the same even if their skin color is different?"" I thought for a moment, then I said, ""I'll explain. Let's go to a fruit store first. I have something interesting to show you."" At the store, I told him that we needed to buy apples. And we bought some red apples, green apples and yellow apples. After we got home, I told Adam, ""It's time to answer your question."" I put one of each type of apple on the table: first a red apple, followed by a green apple and then a yellow apple. Then I looked at Adam, who was sitting on the other side of the table. ""Adam, people are just like apples. They come in different colors, shapes and sizes. See, some may not even look as delicious as others."" As I was talking, Adam was examining each one carefully. Then, I took each of the apples and peeled them, placing them back on the table, but in a different place. ""OK, Adam, tell me which one is the red apple, the green apple and the yellow apple."" He said, ""I can't tell. They all look the same now."" ""Take a bite of each one. See if that helps you tell which one is which."" He took big bites, and then a huge smile came across his face. ""People are just like apples! They are all different, but if you take off the outside, they're pretty much the same on the inside."" ""Right,"" I agreed. ""Just like everyone has their own features but they are nearly the same."" He completely got it. I didn't need to say or do anything else.

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"Last Friday my friend Deborah asked me if I would like to learn how to make tofu. I couldn't think of any good reason not to be interested in, so I said, ""Yes"". The next day I met her and another three nice people at the Hodo Soy Beanery Oakland. I enjoyed the trip. I got a lot from the trip. The following is what I learnt. Tofu has a history of 2,000 years. Although the word ""tofu"" is from Japanese, the food maybe comes from China. There are two main kinds of tofu: soft tofu and firm tofu . In some parts of Asia, people use tofu as a kind of meat. Douhua is one kind of soft tofu. It is a popular breakfast food in China. Because it is very soft, people can't eat it with _ , but with a spoon . People often eat it as a snack and often add spring onions and gravy to it. In Malaysia, people usually eat douhua with white or dark sugar water. ,."	['Douhua is one kind of firm tofu.']
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"China may be the world's largest market for e-bikes, but Europe is fast catching up. The EU's official statistics agency says the figure reached the one million e-bike mark two years ago, and sales have sharply increased since then. When working errands around Berlin, Lutz, who usually works with horses, uses the company's new e-bike that charges easily and has a range of 140 kilometers. ""We found there was no parking spot problem or other worries. And on top of all this, we don't pollute the environment. Petrol is also saved,"" said Lutz Baddack, owner of Reitsport Baddack.

Sales of ordinary bicycles fell in Germany last year, but sales of e-bikes rose by eight percent. Sales figures are expected to keep rising. ""In five years we will have the market share of 20 percent, maybe more,"" said Marcus Kendler, owner of E-Motion. In the hillier parts, that figure has already been beyond it.

The writer was deeply impressed by the scene inPeter Pan because _ .	"My 17-year-old daughter went off to college and having her away from home brought back memories of watchingPeter Pan when she was little. In the classic TV production, one scene in particular impressed me: when Mrs Darling puts her children into bed. As she turns off the last of the night lights, she takes one last look at the bedroom and says, ""Dear night lights, protect my sleeping children."" As a mother, I know how much she loves her children. It has been several weeks since we took our daughter to college and she seems to be adjusting well after a short period of homesickness. For us, though, it's another story. Like most parents, I love checking in on my children at night. But now she's gone, and I find nighttimes the hardest. I miss her most at night.

And it's not just ""first-time"" parents like me. Two moms who have kids already well into college said the separation didn't get any easier. ""You feel like something has been taken away from inside you,"" said one of them. I imagine things will get easier with time, especially as I see my daughter adjust to college life.

Which of the following advantages of the modern buildings is not mentioned in the passage? [ ]	"How many historic churches, pubs or buildings are there in your city? Are there worth preserving? Or are they just a waste of space? There are arguments for and against spending money on historic buildings. Dangerous staircases. Uneven floors. A lack of IT infrastructure. The problem with many old buildings is that they're... old - and extremely expensive to modernize. Take the case of the Combination Room in Cambridge University. It was built in 1347 and was initially used for lectures. Later, it became the Regent House - the university's parliament. It's of enormous historical value and cultural interest. However, it doesn't meet accessibility standards for disabled people. As a result, a lift needs to be installed, but not everyone is happy about this. ""Noting will persuade me that this lift would not in its effect, be a substantial alteration to the most precious room in the university. It would destroy the symmetry of that beautiful room,"" said one user. In general, modern buildings don't have this type of problem. They can be built according to the latest environment standards, with draught proofing and insulation to help reduce carbon emission and save energy. They can also be made wheelchair accessible, and they can be designed to ensure maximum comfort and space. Anyone who's been to a modern cinema, theatre or concert hall recently may understand the difference between the new buildings and older ones, which tend to have smaller seats, less space and poorer acoustics. Very often, there's money to be made by knocking down old building... especially if they're in city centers. So, the biggest threat to many historic buildings comes from developers. One of Croydon's oldest pubs, The Rose and Crown, is a perfect example of this. A property development company has recently been granted permission to convert the 18th century building into flats, much to the disappointment of many local residents. ""The bar is full of unique features and perfect examples of a traditional London pub. It really would be truly tragic for this Grade II listed building to be turned into soulless flats,"" said a spokesperson for English heritage. So, are these buildings really worth preserving? ""Traditional buildings such as churches, town halls, schools and hospitals give England its character,"" the spokesman added.

"China Earthquake Leaves 5,000 Homeless Beijing--An earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale left 5,000 people homeless, killed at least one person and injured 39 others in southwest China on Thursday, with more accidents expected. By late Thursday, 4,900 people were declared homeless after the quake destroyed their homes in a mountainous area lying on the border between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The dawn quake left one dead and 39 injured, destroyed 268 houses and damaged 1,132 other buildings so seriously that they were considered uninhabitable . Another 2,400 houses suffered less serious damage. The center of the earthquake was near the scenic Lugu Lake, a tourist place, where the local school was badly damaged. In the beginning people thought that the economic losses would add up to about 180 million yuan (22 million dollars). Governments in Yanyuan and the neighboring Yunnan country of Ninglang have joined forces in the rescue efforts and tents, clothes and medicine are badly in need of for the earthquake victims. The mountainous place, heavy rain and several aftershocks all prevented rescue efforts on Thursday. The rain could cause more badly damaged homes to fall down.

What is important about the stone block mentioned in the passage?	"Anthropologists are scientists that study people who often lived hundreds or even thousands of years ago. Items those men, women, and children left behind when they died --- everything from clothing to jewelry and tools --- tell anthropologists a lot. And sometimes even their words survive. Experts believe that a discovery in Mexico is the oldest example of writing ever found in the Americas. The people who created it probably lived 3,000 years ago, long before Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World. Workers digging in a rock mine happened to notice a stone block with marks carved onto its surface. They found the large piece of stone near the city of Cascajal, Mexico, which was once the capital of an ancient people called the Ohmec. ""There are signs on the block that seem to show objects used by the Olmec during their religious ceremonies,"" says Dr. Stephen Houston, of Brown University in the USA. ""There is a sign that looks very similar to a knife and another that looks like the chair of a King,"" he explains. Houston, an expert on the writing systems of ancient cultures, says the discovery is exciting because ""it makes clear that the Olmec could read and write. It is like hearing voices from the past."" But experts don't know exactly what the writing says. Finding other examples of Olmec writing could help decipher the puzzle. ""We could have whole sets of ancient writing which will basically make ancient people speak to us directly,"" says Houston. ""There are many puzzles to be solved, and this is just one of them."""

From the passage, we know an eco-passage is _ .	"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side. Most people know this joke. But recently, some people have been much more worried about how the grizzly bear and mountain lion can cross the road. "" Millions of animals die each year on the U. S. roads, "" the Federal Highway Administration reports. In fact, only about 80 ocelots , an endangered wild cat, exist in the U. S. today. The main reason? Roadkill. ""Eco-passages"" may help animals cross the road without being hit by cars. They are paths both over and under roads. "" These ecopassages can be extremely useful,so that wildlife can avoid road accidents ,"" said Jodi Hilty of the Wildlife Protection Society. But do animals actually use the eco-passages? The answer is yes. Paul Beier of Northern Arizona University found foot marks left by mountain lions on an eco-passage that went under a highway. This showed that the lions used the passage. Builders of eco-passages try to make them look like a natural part of an area by planting trees on and around them. Animals seem to be catching on. Animals as different as salamanders and grizzly bears are using the bridges and underpasses. The next time you visit a park or drive through an area with a lot of wildlife, look around. You might see an animal over-pass !"	['a path for animals to cross the road']
The author wrote the passage in order to _ .	"I am a senior in high school. For four years I have been a member of the marching band at my school---four years of commitment to an organization of 150 kids, four teachers and 100 parents working from August to June of every school year. For four years, my mom has been there for me---never complaining and never receiving a ""Thanks, mom."" My mom is pretty much a supermom and, unfortunately, it took me some seventeen years to realize it. ""Driver"" is probably a more appropriate name for her. Every concert, every competition, every football game, my mom was there with a smile, and always stayed to watch. When she couldn't be there, she would be waiting for me when the bus pulled in to the school's parking lot. She actually enjoyed arriving at the school at 10:30 at night just for me to tell her that I was going out with my friends and that I needed twenty dollars instead of a ride home. Now that I'm a senior, I have my own car and drive myself to my football games and concerts. My mother still comes to watch me. Recently, my band was invited to play for a celebration. When the bus pulled up to the flagpole in front of my high school, I had the strangest feeling. Something was missing. I found myself nervously searching for my mom in the parking lot. I needed to tell her I didn't need a ride home; I was going out. I then realized my mother was at home and probably in bed. I never realized how much I took her for granted until she wasn't there. When I got home that night, I woke her up and told her I loved her and I missed her. I told my mom that I really appreciated all the times she had driven me back and forth. I told her I was glad she embarrassed me all those times, because I knew that it just meant she loved me, too. My mom looked back at me with tears and a big smile."	"[""show us his mother's love""]"
What was the event showing Cuba's change for the better?	"In anticipation of an extraordinary visit, the streets and buildings of Havana, Cuba, were cleaned and painted by dozens of workers. What was the occasion? For the first time in nearly 90 years, a sitting United States president was coming to Cuba, an island nation 90 miles south of Florida. On Sunday, President Barack Obama, joined by his family, stepped off Air Force One and onto a rainy runway, where Cuban dignitaries eagerly awaited him. ""It's wonderful to be here, "" the president said. The last time a U.S. president came to Cuba was in 1928. It was President Calvin Coolidge, and he arrived on a battleship. Obama will be in Cuba through Tuesday. He is set to meet with Cuba's president, Raul Castro, attend a state dinner and even take in a baseball game. The U.S. cut all ties with Cuba after Fidel Castro's communist government took control of the island in 1959. In the years that followed, both countries' opposing political views furthered the separation. Plans for social and economic change began after President Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, Raul in 2008. Raul Castro then set a plan in motion to revive the country's economy. Since then, Cuba has been taking small, yet lasting steps toward change by removing a number of restrictions that had been set on its citizens, such as access to the Internet, the use of cellphones, and by allowing people to work at jobs not controlled by the government. Cuba, however, still has tough limits on media, public assembly and political opposition. Obama hopes to share his vision for Cuba's future during a speech he will deliver. Before the trip, Senior Advisor Ben Rhodes said the president hoped to use this visit as a way to ""continue to create openings for great engagement between the American and Cuban people."""

What would be the best title of the passage?	"The weather across much of Europe and sections of Asia has been very cold since last week. Hundreds of people have died from the cold. It has also been a source of fun for winter sports enthusiasts and has raised doubts about global warming. Europeans were digging themselves out of heavy snow after a week-long cold snap in which the number of dead--most of them homeless--continued to rise by the day. The big freeze has caused traffic mess from Siberia to Rome, blocking roads, closing schools, shutting airports, and trapping thousands in remote mountain villages in Europe. Temperatures have fallen as low as 36 degrees below zero in Ukraine, the hardest-hit country. Serbia on Sunday declared an emergency situation, saying the extremely big snowfall has put normal life at risk. But the deep freeze has also offered opportunities for snowy fun. In Sarajevo, young people snowboarded down white streets. Others competed with videos on YouTube to show the craziest jump into the snow from second floor apartments--most of them wearing only bathing suits. In the Netherlands, Europe's deep freeze means the country's almost imaginary ""Eleven Cities Tour"" ice skating marathon could be staged later this month for the first time in 15 years. The race is expected to draw thousands of participants and more than a million viewers. The cold snap has also caused people to doubt global warming claims--if the Earth is getting warmer, why have recent winters been colder? Zhang Peiqun, assistant chief engineer of the National Climate Center, explained in an interview with xinhuanet. com: ""Global warming refers to broad changes over a long time period, mainly in the past 100 years. It doesn't contradict with the phenomenon that some time in some places the temperature is lower than usual."" He also added that it has been a long time debate whether the Earth is getting warmer or colder. ""No matter which opinion is correct, a bigger question faces us: how do we deal with the resulting extreme weathers?"" he said."	['Freeze Raises Issues']

From what Marci said, we can learn that she _ .	"""Joe? Is chat you?"" The woman speaking to me at he baseball game looked somewhat familiar, ""Marci? "" ""It IS you ! "" she exclaimed, smiling broadly. ""God, it's good to see you again !"" It was good to see Marci, too. Very often during the past few decades, I've wondered about her, I almost tried to reach her a few years ago after talking to a shared friend, who had indicated that the 1990s had been pretty rough for Marci. So, running into her at the baseball game was, at the very least, just happening by chance. We spent a few minutes talking about the business of our lives: kids and grandkids, husbands and houses, education and recreation. It's always a little upsetting to see how few words are required to summarize 32 years of living. We played a little ""have you seen...?"" and ""did you know,..?"" And we recalled the good old, bad old days we used to spend together. Then Marci grew quiet for a moment, looking out over the crowd walking about the marketing area at the stadium. ""You know, Joe."" she said, ""I've always wanted to tell you...how...you know...how sorry I am for the way I treated you."" Hearing that, I felt I was suffering extreme embarrassment. One does not like to remember when one has been rid of by others roughly and suddenly. ""It's OK."" I said. ""No big deal."" At least, I thought to myself, not now. ""But I was so stupid: she continued. Yes, you were. I thought. ""We were both pretty young:' I said. ""I know,"" she said. ""But that's no excuse for..."" She hesitated. then continued. ""It's just always bothered me, remembering how mean I was to you.And I've wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. So...I'm sorry."" The smile on her face was warm and sincere, and there was something in her eyes, it looked a lot like relief-- _ since she had played Wif'fle ball with my heart. ""OK:'I said. ""Apology accepted! Overcome by the sweetness of the moment. I reached an arm around her and gave her a quick hug Just then, the crowd erupted with a huge cheer, and Marci and I both returned our attention to the game By the time I looked over to where she had been, she was gone. But the warm, wonderful feeling of our brief exchange was still there, and continues to this day whenever I think about it . We all carry bitter, discomforting memories of deeds done or undone, and words said or unsaid. And we all bear wounds --some slight, some not so slight--that have been inflicted upon us by others.The healing balm of forgiveness can calm a troubled conscience and bring peace to an injured soul, even years after the fact. Of course,it isn't enough to just say ""I'm sorry,"" and ""You're forgiven."" While there is indeed great power in those simple words, it is not available to those who are insincere, or who are only looking for a way to control or exploit.But when those words are truly felt and sincerely expressed , they can open the door to miracles( )of the heart and soul - miracles of forgiveness, even at a baseball game."

Along their journey to look for the river, the animals find _ .	Animals United Animals United is a 3D German cartoon which is directed by Reinhard Klooss and Holger Tappe.It is a story about animals that get together to find water.Along their journey, lots of funny things happen, and of course, they have a lot of adventures.

The courtesy minute was hidden from the public to _ .	"For a commuter rushito catch a train, a minute can mean the difference between dinner with the family and foods in the microwave. What most passengers don't realize is that their minute is already there. Every commuter train that departs from New York Cityabout 900 a d leaves a minute later than scheduled. If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at 8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You have two. The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private timetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and onto the train. ""If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing unimportant things,"" explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad. Told of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. ""Don't blow our cover!""she said. Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the railroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy. The railroad industry helped invent the concept* of standard time, and time zones were established in the United States in the 1880s, 35 years before they were written into law. And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute it departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is carried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades. ""That's been done forever, from my knowledge,"" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial historian of Metro-North. ""I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case since 1870 for all I know."""	"[""prevent the passengers' idleness""]"
What is the passage mainly about?	"China has been drinking tea since the time of Shennong, 5,000 years ago. Britain's relationship with tea is much shorter, but tea enjoys the pride as the UK's national drink. According to the UK Tea Council, British people drink an average of three cups a day or a national total of 165 million cups every day. With figures like these, it is no surprise that time spent taking tea affects the working day in Britain. A recent survey found that 24 minutes a day are lost to making, buying and drinking tea and coffee. That is, PS400 a year is lost in working hours per employee, or 190 days over a lifetime. So, should employers be worried about this lost working time, or does the tea break make up in other ways? One argument is that caffeine improves mental state: a drink of tea or coffee can make you active and focus on work. Professor Rogers of the University of Bristol disagrees. After years of studying caffeine he sees nothing can prove that. ""Workers would perform equally well if not drinking it at all,"" he says. ""But if they're often drinking it and then go without, they'll feel tired and won't work well."" Psychologist Cooper instead emphasizes the role tea breaks play in office life, and in building social relationships. ""We need to make people more active and see other people. The tea break is one way of doing this,"" says Cooper. And Professor Rogers also points out the comfort effect of a hot drink: ""We warm our hands on them on a cold day; they're comforting and play a big role in our everyday life. Whatever the caffeine's doing, I'd say these 24 minutes aren't wasted."""	"[""Tea break plays an important role in people's life in Britain.""]"
What can we learn about Facebook according to the text?	"Unknown to most Facebook users, the social network actually offers a lot of privacy controls and security features which can help you lock your account, so you can speak freely. If it's used properly, you'll never have to worry about whether you will have to ""friend"" your boss or your mom. You can friend anyone you want while staying comfortable in the knowledge that not everyone gets to see everything you post. The problem with carrying out these privacy options is that they're just too confusing for most non-tech clever people to handle. And often, most people don't want to bother to take the time to learn. To simplify the process, we're offering one easy step you can take today to help make your Facebook experience safer, more secure, and more private. Just make ""Friend Lists"". Yes, it will take some time, especially if you're connected to a couple of hundred friends already. But this step, while not the quickest, is fairly simple. And it will be one of the most useful things you can do on Facebook. Friend lists, as the name suggests, are lists for classifying your friends into various groups. The nice thing about this feature is that once you set these lists up, you won't have to do it again. We suggest that you put your work colleagues and professional acquaintances into a friend list named ""Work"", personal friends you're not very close with into a list called ""Acquaintances"", and people you're related to into a list called ""Family"". Those three main categories will separate out the groups of ""friends"" who you may want to hide some information from. To create a friend list, click on ""Friends"" at the top of the Facebook homepage. In the left-hand column, click ""Friends"" again under the ""Lists"" section. Now you'll see a button at the top that says ""Create New List"". Click it. In the pop-up that appears, you can name your list and pick members. If you've ever shared an application with your friends, the process of doing this will be very familiar. When you've finished making lists, you'll be able to use them when selecting who can see what (or who can't!) when configuring the security settings described below."

Which of the following can England take comfort from?	"England will play Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica in a tough Group D at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Roy Hodgson's men open their campaign against Italy in the Amazonian city of Manaus on 15 June in the only World Cup game which kicks off at 02:00 BST. England take on Uruguay on 19 June and play Costa Rica five days later. Hosts Brazil are in Group A with Cameroon, Mexico and Croatia while the World Cup holders Spain open with a repeat of the 2010 final against Netherlands. England will have to travel 1,777 miles from their chosen base in Rio for their first match in the tropical heat of Manaus. Earlier this week Hodgson described Manaus as ""the place to avoid"" because of the climate--temperatures reach 30C and humidity is about 80%--although after the draw the England boss took comfort from the fact his team face a fellow European side. ""The conditions in the north will be tough, so we will both be in same boat,"" he said. ""If we'd had three games up in the north, it would have been difficult."" Following Hodgson's initial comments, the mayor of Manaus, Arthur Virgilio, said England would not be welcome in the city. England takes on two-time champions Uruguay in Sao Paulo and they play Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte--both cities are within 225 miles of their base. England have never previously beaten Italy or Uruguay at a major tournament , while they have never faced Costa Rica. Uruguay, who reached the semi-finals in 2010, and Italy, who knocked Hodgson's men out of Euro 2012, are ranked sixth and seventh respectively in the Fifa rankings while Costa Rica are 31st in the world - 18 places below England."

What would be the best title for the passage?	"Anne is six years older than me. Growing up, we were very poor, and my mother worked evenings at a factory in a small town. Not seeing my mother much, Anne looked after me and my younger sister. During those hard years, Anne was always there for me, not only as a big sister, but as a mother and my best friend. When I was seventeen and had no money, I thought my only chance of going to college was if I could win a scholarship. I had an important interview for such an award. Anne at that time was struggling, surviving on a part-time job as she put herself through the local community college after serving in the army. I told her of my interview. I asked her advice on what to wear and showed her my best outfit and how I planned to be careful, how I sat so that the hole in the bottom of my shoes would not be seen, but I wasn't sure what I would do if it rained. Anne suggested that we go shopping, and we took the bus to the JCPenney store. We found a beautiful pair of leather shoes on sale. She told me to try them on, but I thought it was just for fun as neither of us had ever owned anything that expensive before. But Anne handed me the boxed shoes and said, ""Here, I'll buy these for you."" ""But . . ."" was all I could say. ""You deserve them,"" she replied. ""This interview is important. I want to see you get that scholarship."" I was speechless as I knew this was a lot of money for her, and she would probably have to eat nothing but noodles for at least a month. I went to the interview and crossed my legs so that my beautiful new shoes shone with pride. I won the scholarship and became an engineer. Although they were nice leather everyday shoes, I didn't wear them much because they were so special. Now, after 20 years have passed, I still have that pair of shoes with me, and I just wear them on those occasions when I need to feel special."	['A special pair of new shoes']

The passage mainly targets _ .	"As we all know, children are our future, and it's up to us to arm them with the tools to succeed. Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, ""Will home schools really work for my children?"" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college. One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons. For more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668."

According to the passage, which of the following impressed the writer most?	"As a young boy, I sometimes traveled the country roads with my dad. He was a rural mill carrier, and on Saturdays he would ask me to go with him. Driving through the countryside was always an adventure: There were animals to see, people to visit, and chocolate cookies if you knew where to stop, and Dad did. In the spring, Dad delivered boxes full of baby chickens, and when 1 was a boy it was such a fun to stick your finger 'through one of the holes of the boxes and let the baby birds peck on your fingers. On Dad' s final day of work, it took him well into the evening to complete his rounds because at least one member from each family was waiting at their mailbox to thank him for his friendship and his years of service. ""Two hundred and nineteen mailboxes on my route."" he used to say, ""and a story at every one. "" One lady had no mailbox, so Dad took the mail in to her every day because she was nearly blind. Once inside, he read her mail and helped her pay her bills. Mailboxes were sometimes used for things other than mail. One note left in a mailbox read. ""Nat, take these eggs to Marian; she's baking a cake and doesn't have any eggs. "" Mailboxes might be buried in the snow, or broken, or lying on the groom:. bat the mail was always delivered On cold days Dad might find one of his customers waiting for him with a cup of hot chocolate. A young wrote letters but had no stamps, so she left a few button on the envelope in the mailbox; Dad paid for the stamps. One businessman used to leave large amounts of cash in his mailbox for Dad to take to the bank. Once, the amount came to 8 32,000. A dozen years ago, when I traveled back to my hometown on the sad occasion of Dad's death, the mailboxes along the way reminded me of some of his stories. I thought I knew them all, but that wasn't the case. As I drove home, I noticed two lamp poles, one on each side of the street. When my dad was around, those poles supported wooden boxes about four feet off the ground. One box was painted green and the other was red, and each had a long narrow hole at the top with white lettering: SANTA CLAUS, NORTH POLE. For years children had dropped letters to Santa through those holes. I made a turn at the comer and drove past the post office and across the railroad tracks to our house. Mom and I were sitting at the kitchen table when I heard footsteps. There, at the door, stood Frank Townsend, Dad's postmaster and great friend for many years. So we all sat down at the table and began to tell stories. At one point Frank looked at me with tears in his eyes. "" What are we going to do about the letters this Christmas?"" he asked. ""The letters?"" 'I guess you never knew. "" ""Knew what?"" "" Remember, when you were a kid and you used to put your letters to Santa in those green and red boxes on Main Street? It was your dad who answered all those letters every year. "" I just sat there with tears in my eyes. It wasn't hard for me to imagine Dad sitting at the old table in our basement reading those letters and answering each one. I have since spoken with several of the people who received Christmas letters during their childhood, and they told me how amazed they were that Santa had known so much about their homes and families. For me, just knowing that story about my father was the gift of a lifetime."	"[""Dad answered children's Christmas letters every year.""]"

The author and his classmates can't help crying at graduation services as _ .	When I was six, my mother placed me in a boarding home. For the next nine years, I never slept in a room that contained less than 30 other kids in it. So, when I was promoted to senior at the high school for my final year there, I had the greatest pleasure of rooming with just one other classmate, and the added feature of a semi-private bathroom. We seniors also had the feature of walking around the campus in special hats, we called senior bonnets. So all the other kids would know we were the highest in the high school. As seniors, we frequently went on field trips outside the campus, including city museums, city hall, colleges and theatres. The highlight was a senior class trip to Washington, D.C., where we sat in on a session of Congress, visited the monument and many other government sites around the city. Another benefit of being seniors was that many of us on athletic and other extra-curricular teams were elected to high ranking for the year. I had the honor and pleasure of being chosen captain of our state championship swim team, while my roommate was voted president of the drama club. Graduation services were on a sunny day in June. Each of us had looked forward to this moment for ten years. Now we were going out on our own to complete freedom, and we should have been flooded with joy. However, to my surprise, I found myself crying, something I hadn't done for years. I noticed many of my classmates usually proud of their macho guy attitudes, were also wiping away tears. We knew we would never be together again as we were on that graduation day. Our senior year ended with deep feelings of sadness for our loss, as well as joy for our emerging into a new world beyond the school campus.

Which of the following is true according to the text?	"Owning a smartphone may not be as smart as you think. It may let you surf the Internet, listen to music and snap photos wherever you are...but it also turns you into a workaholic, it seems. A study suggests that, by giving you access to emails at all times, the all-singing, all-dancing mobilephone adds as much as two hours to your working day. Researchers found that Britons work an additional 460 hours a year on average as they are able to respond to emails on their mobiles. The study by technology retailer Pixmania reveals the average UK working day is between 9 and 10 hours, but a further two hours is spent responding to or sending work emails, or making work calls. More than 90 percent of office workers have email-enabled phones, with a third _ them more than 20 times a day. Almost one in ten admits spending up to three hours outside their normal working day checking work emails. Some workers confess they are on call almost 24 hours a day, with nine out of ten saying they make work emails and calls outside their normal working hours. The average time for first checking emails is between 6 am and 7 am, with more than a third checking their first emails in this period, and a quarter checking them between 11 pm and midnight. Ghadi Hobeika, marketing director of Pixmania, said, ""The ability to access literally millions of apps, keep in contact via social networks and take photos and video as well as text and call has made smartphones invaluable for many people. However, there are drawbacks. Many companies expect their employees to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and smartphones mean that people literally cannot get away from work. The more constantly in contact we become , the more is expected of us in a work capacity ."""	['One-fourth check their first mail between 11 pm and midnight.']
According to the passage the preference test was conducted in order to _ .	Taste is such a subjective matter that we don't usually conduct preference tests for food. The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies--Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting. We invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic or Pepsi, Diet Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand. We eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished. Getting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials. The diet-cola drinkers did a little worse----only 7 of 27 identified all four samples correctly. While both groups did better than chance would predict, nearly half the participants in each group made the wrong choice two or more times. Two people got all four samples wrong. Overall, half the participants did about as well on the last round of tasting as on the first, so tiredness, or taste _ , was not a factor. Our preference test results suggest that only a few Pepsi participants and Coke fans may really be able to tell their favorite brand by taste and price.

The advantage of employees having foreign language skills is that they can _ .	"New technology links the world as never before. Our planet has shrunk. It's now a ""global village"" where countries are only seconds away by fax or phone or satellite link. And, of course, our ability to benefit from this high-tech communications equipment is greatly increased by foreign language skills. Deeply involved with this new technology is a kind of modern businesspeople who have a growing respect for the economic value of doing business abroad. In modern markets, success overseas often helps support domestic business efforts. Overseas assignments are becoming increasingly important to advancement within executive ranks. The executive stationed in another country no longer need fear being ""out of sight and out of mind."" He or she can be sure that the overseas effort is central to the company's plan for success, and that promotions often follow or accompany an assignment abroad. If an employee can succeed in a difficult assignment overseas, superiors will have greater confidence in his or her ability to manage back in the United States where cross-cultural considerations and foreign language issues are becoming more and more common. Thanks to a variety of relatively inexpensive communications devices with business applications, even small businesses in the United States are able to get into international markets. English is still the international language of business. But there is an ever-growing need for people who can speak another language. A second language isn't generally required to get a job in business, but having language skills gives a candidate the edge when other qualifications appear to be equal. The employee posted abroad who speaks the country's language has an opportunity to fast-forward certain negotiations, and can have the cultural insight to know when it is better to move more slowly. The employee at the home office who can communicate well with foreign customers over the telephone or by fax machine is an obvious asset to the firm."	['better control the whole negotiation process']
From the passage we know that Big Ben clock tower will fall silent to _ .	"London will stage its biggest political funeral in almost half a century on Wednesday when Britain's governing elite join the Queen and global leaders to bid farewell to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, better known as the "" Iron Lady"". In an event comparable to that of Winston Churchill's funeral in 1965, Thatcher's coffin will be carried on a horse-drawn gun carriage through streets lined with admirers from parliament to the city's most famous cathedral. The bells of London's symbolic Big Ben clock tower will fall silent for the first time since Churchill's funeral and more than 700 men and women from Britain's armed forces will honor a woman who led them to victory in the 1982 Falklands War as foreign politicians from around 170 nations look on. Surveys have shown that many are unhappy that the estimated l0-million($15 million)pound bill for the funeral is being picked up by the taxpayer, while some left-wing lawmakers say the luxurious funeral is too expensive. But her admirers, of whom there are many in her party and in southern England, argue that her historical profile deserves such a funeral. She was the country's first and only woman premier, was Britain's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century, and won three general elections. More than 2,300 mourners will attend including 11 serving prime ministers from around the world, the British government's entire cabinet, two heads of state and 17 foreign ministers. But there will be notable absences. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is too ill to attend and Nancy Reagan, the widow of Thatcher's great U*S. ally Ronald Reagan, is also unable to come. Thatcher struck up a close relationship with Reagan during the Cold War, backed the first President George Bush during the 1991 Gulf War, and was among the first to discover that Gorbachev was a man she could ""do business with. "" Covered in the red, white and blue British flag, Thatcher's coffin lay overnight in a 13th-century church in Britain's parliament, a forum she dominated for years."

We can infer from the passage that _ .	"Is a mouse that can speak acceptable? How about a dog with human hands or feet? Scientists, the people with the know-how to make such things happen, are now thinking about whether such experiments are morally right or not. On Nov. 10, Britain's Academy of Medical Sciences launched a study on the use of animals with human materials in scientific research. The work is expected to take at least a year, but its leaders hope it will lead to guidelines for scientists in Britain and around the world on how far _ can go mixing human genes into animals in search of ways to fight human diseases. ""Do these constructs challenge our idea of what it is to be human?"" asked Martin Bobrow, a professor of medical genetics at Cambridge University and chair of a 14-member group looking into the issue. ""It is important that we consider these questions now so that appropriate boundaries are recognized."" Using human material in animals is not new. Scientists have already created monkeys that have a human form of the Huntingdon's gene so they can study how the disease develops; and mice with livers made from human cells are being used to study the effects of new drugs. However, scientists say the technology to put ever greater amounts of human genetic material into animals is spreading quickly around the world --- raising the possibility that some scientists in some places may want to go further than is morally acceptable. Last year in Britain there was a lively debate over new laws allowing the creation of human-animal embryos for experiments. On one side of the debate were religious groups, who claimed that such science interferes with nature. Opposing them were scientists who pointed out that such experiments were vital to research cures for diseases. The experts will publish reports after the end of the study, in which they will give definitions for animal embryos with human genes or cells, look at safety and animal welfare issues, and consider the right legal framework to work within."

Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe became famous for _ .	The pen is more powerful than the sword. There have been many writers who use their pens to write things that were wrong. Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe was one of them. She was born in the U. S. A. in 1811. One of her books not only made her famous but has been described as one that excited the world, and was helpful in causing a civil war and freeing the enslaved race. The civil war was the American Civil War of 1861, in which the Northern States fought the Southern States and finally won. This book that shook the world was called Uncle Tom's Cabin. There was a time when every English-speaking man, woman, and child had read this novel that did so much to stop slavery. Not many people read it today, but it is still very interesting, if only to show how a warm-hearted writer can arouse people's sympathies. The author herself had neither been to the Southern States nor seen a slave. The Southern Americans were very angry at the book, which they said did not at all represent the true state of affairs, but the Northern Americans were widely excited over it, and were so inspired by it that they were ready to go to war to set the slaves free.

If a person is said to be as American as apple pie, it means that _ .	"Another food which is closely associated with Americans is apple pie.Apple pie is often served hot with a spoon of ice cream or a slice of cheese at the end of the biggest meal of the day--dinner, and it is a favorite dessert throughout the nation.If a person is typical of Americans, we can say, ""He is as American as apple pie."" It is true that the apple and apple pie do not originate in America, but the expression ""as American as apple pie"" is not the product of a pure imagination.As early as 1625, the English colonists, having brought orchards on this new land and in most of the colonial times, the apple was a main material of both plain and fancy cooking.The first Massachusetts governor, William Endicott, was one of many keen apple planters who helped to lay the foundations for today' s apple-growing industry in America. A major attraction of the apple for the colonists was that it could be made into cider . Like most Europeans, English colonists held a strong suspicion of drinking water, and since grape growing was _ by plant peats, cider became an alternative to wine.Cheap and easy to produce, it was the American drink of first choice well into the nineteenth century.Whether it was dried, raw or cooked, the apple also found its way into numerous colonial dishes, including apple sauces, pudding, stuffing and many desserts.Therefore, the conclusion to be drawn here is obvious.The apple pie became known as American, not because it was invented on this land (since it was proved that Europeans had been eating apple pies for centuries), but because, thanks to the huge orchards in the states of Washington and New York, America became the world's largest apple-producing nation."

Which of the following statement is NOT right?	"Halloween is a festival on October 31st.The name of the holiday means --""hallowed"" because it comes the day before All Saints Day. Before the festival, people paint homes, shops and classrooms in the traditional Halloween colours, orange and black. Some people make costumes at home. Some people buy them in shops. People also make decorations for the festival. These decorations look like witches, black cats, ghosts, skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Jack-o- lanterns are pumpkins that are cut to look like faces. People think that Halloween is the children's New Year's Eve. On that day children dress up in special costumes and masks. They eat too much, and go to bed very late after celebrating. They go from one door to another saying ""trick or treat"". People give them candies,cookies,fruit or money. Adults and older children also celebrate Halloween with parades ,festivals and costumes parties. One kind of the parties welcomed by children is dunking for apples. Apples are put in tubs full of water. People try to get the apples using only their mouths; they cannot use their hands."	['People can get the apples using their hands.']
We can infer from the text that Kidget _ .	Technology and the present generation of kids go hand in hand. Taking advantage of this factor, Lim Hojoon, the designer from South Korea, has come up with an educational gadget especially for children. Kidget, as the name suggests, is a combination of two words - kid and gadget. This kid-friendly gadget has various uses. When your child is in a mood to read, it takes the form of a storybook. When the mood is to draw and color this wonder gadget turns into a perfect canvas . Your child can freely give color to all his/her imaginations. Should he or she wish to have some fun, see this device change into a musical instrument. You too would enjoy doing activities with your loved one using this gadget. This touch screen device will definitely prove to be an ideal friend. As many parents agree, in this age of technological advancements it is much easier to introduce children to new gadgets than adults. While many adults refrain from trying out something new, kids are more than prepared to take the leap. Keeping this fact in mind, Kidget is the perfect gift for the child of the 21st century. You will be surprised to see how fast your little one gets acquainted with the device. You might even find yourself lagging behind at times. Kidget has another hidden advantage. It helps take the load off young shoulders. With three things rolled into one, a child has much less books, stationary items and related goods to carry. It comes with a promise to make life simpler for kids. Not only is it simple to use but also easy to carry along. The stylish protective case comes with a belt attached to it. Children up to 14 years of age, the targeted audience, enjoy the freedom that comes with it.	['is a perfect gift for kids']

Why does the moon look bright?	On sunny days we can see the sun in the sky. It looks like a hot and bright plate. But it is a ball. It is much bigger and hotter than any fire. And it is much brighter than all the lights in the world. The sun is a star but it looks much bigger and brighter than any other star. Many stars are much bigger than the sun. The sun is much nearer to us, so it looks much bigger. At night we can see the moon and many stars. The moon is a round ball. It is much smaller than the stars.

It can be learned from the text that _ .	"Forget chip fat, sugar cane or rapeseed oil -- the latest source of biofuel could be watermelons. Scientists have discovered that the fruit is a great source of sugar that can be readily distilled into alcohol to power cars and farm machinery. And sellers reject 360,000 tons of ""substandard"" fruit every year in America alone which could be used as an economical way to make fuel. The waste from US growers could produce nearly two million gallons (nine million litres) of biofuel per year. In the study, researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture set out to determine the biofuel potential of juice from rejected watermelons --those not sold due to imperfections, and currently ploughed back into the field. About a fifth of each yearly watermelon crop is left in the field because of surface blemishes or because they are misshapen. Dr. Wayne Fish, who led the team, found that 50 percent of the fruit was fermentable into alcohol which could provide valuable fuel. ""We've shown that the juice of these watermelons is a source of readily fermentable sugars, representing an unexploited raw material for alcohol biofuel production,"" he said. The study, published in the journal Biotechnology for Biofuels, discovered that watermelons could produce around 20 gallons of fuel per acre from fruit that otherwise would go to waste. Production of biofuels has been targeted by Western governments as a way to support renewable energy targets. The European Union has a target for 2010 that 5.75 percent of transport fuels should come from biological sources, but the target is unlikely to be met. The British government's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation requires five percent of the fuel sold at the pump by 2010 to be biofuel."

What was the purpose of the stress test carried out by Jaremka's team?	"WHAT do you do when you feel lonely? Hide yourself away and spend your time reading, watching TV or walking around? You might think that feeling lonely is just like feeling happy, sad or scared - that it's just one of your various moods . That is true. However, if you let yourself be lonely for too long without dealing with it, you could be making a serious mistake. Doctors have known for some time that feeling lonely is bad for the mind. It can lead to mental health problems such as depression ,stress and reduced confidence. ""Being lonely means not feeling connected or cared for, it's not about being physically alone,"" Lisa Jaremka, scientist from Ohio State University, US, told Live Science in January. But there's growing evidence that not having friends is connected with physical illness as well. In 2006, for example, scientists studied 2,800 women who had cancer. They found that those who had few friends or family were five times more likely to die of their disease than women with many social contacts. Also, even healthy people had a better chance of falling ill if they felt left out by others, according to the BBC. The results have scientists thinking that loneliness might hurt the immune system , which protects the body from diseases. Hoping to prove this theory, Jaremka and her research team put volunteers through a stress test. During the test, volunteers were asked to make an unprepared speech in front of a group of stony-faced people. The researchers found that volunteers who said they were lonely in their daily lives felt more stress during the test. And their blood samples showed that all the stress had managed to cause harmful changes to their immune system. ""Loneliness has been thought of in many ways as a chronic stressor --- a socially painful situation that can last for quite a long time,"" explained Jaremka, who led the study. The number of people suffering from loneliness is increasing all over the world. However, solving the problem is easier said than done. It won't work to just ""tell anyone to go out and find someone to love you"", said Jaremka. "" We need to create support networks."""	"[""To prove loneliness hurts people's immune systems.""]"
Why did the four Japanese gentlemen leave Mary suddenly?	"A lady named Mary from California flew to Japan, in her favourite jeans and a casual jacket, to give her first speech. Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at the airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Mary took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Mary to tea in the lobby . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, ""Oh, it's beautiful!"" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said ""Sayonara"" and left immediately. Poor Mary was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first _ . Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet clients casually dressed. The second mistake was Mary's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools. It is always presented and accepted respectfully with both hands. However, Mary put their cards away much too quickly. In Japan, people use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other's cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gently and respectfully place yours in safe keeping. Putting it carelessly into her jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Then, the fourth horror of horrors was that Mary should not have opened the gift in front of her clients. In a land where saving face is critical, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. What is worse, Mary hadn't even given them a gift!"

No, this isn't a ghost kitchen--it's the kitchen of the future. Scientists are working to improve everything in the kitchen, from fridges to tables, and even the ways we cook. They are making a system. It will help a person cook a meal. You don't need cookbooks. You can hear how to cook food. The fridge of the smart kitchen has a scanner. It looks at the foods in the fridge. It will order more milk from the store when your milk has gone bad or there is no more in the fridge. The gloves will test the temperature of everything they touch and say, ""Need to cook longer"" or ""Hot and ready to eat"". If you leave them on the stove by mistake, they'll say, ""Fire!"" Even the knives and spoons will speak. For example, if your food is bad, the knives and spoons will tell you not to eat it. The future kitchen may look wonderful, but it's not cheap.

"""Earth Hour""is held in the world every year in order to _ ."	"If you haven't already, you too should switch to the latest eco-friendly, energy-efficient, energy-saving LED (Light Emitting Diode) lighting. As the world becomes more focused on green issues, everyone should do their part in practicing energy efficiency, recycling, cutting down their CO2emissions and much, much more. One of the most successful campaigns that started in Australia is the now world-famous""Earth Hour"". 2.2 million of Sydney's residents turned off their lights for an hour in a mass attempt to save energy. The following year, the same idea was adopted by a whole host of different cities. This is a great example of a campaign to promote eco-friendly options and energy efficiency. But while it clearly raises awareness, it is not a long-term solution to energy saving across the developed world. A long-term solution can be found in the form of switching to LED lighting rather than the traditional halogen lights found in a typical home. Put simply, LED lighting is the future of lighting. LED lamps use up only a fraction of the energy compared to that of regular lamps. They also produce a quality flicker-free light, and will last longer than a regular light with 50,000 hours being realistic. Not only are they longer lasting and more energy-efficient with no sacrifice in light quality, but they may quickly become a possible substitute for regular lamps that have been previously installed by homes and businesses. An ordinary 50 watt low-voltage halogen light on for 4 hours a day would cost $ 25 per year to run. With a life span of around 3,000 hours it will typically stop working at the two-year mark. Compared with the regular one, an LED light of 50 watts operating for the same period will cost roughly $ 6 per year to run and last 50,000 hours. That means it won't have to be replaced for 24 years! It really is a _ to switch to energy-saving LED lighting. Plus, you will be doing your bit for the environment by becoming more eco-friendly."

From the survey by UWE, we can know 80% of men _ .	"Are you concerned about your body image? These days, both women and men are surrounded by magazines and websites full of tips about dieting, exercise and fashion. Not to mention hairstyles! Gone are the days when all men had to think about was wearing a nice suit to be smart and handsome. Things have changed. Now, a survey by the University of the West of England(UWE) has suggested that 80% of men confess to being unhappy about their body. The biggest body issues for them were beer bellies and lack of muscles. Some think this sudden vanity is due to the pressure or influence of role models we see on TV and in magazines. People end up with a perception of what the perfect body should look like. But not everybody wants to put in the effort to have perfect pecs and dazzling white teeth like Arnold Schwarzenegger. An opportunistic entrepreneur has even invented a muscle-enhancing shirt to be worn under a man's clothes to make him look more of a hunk. But Joe Warner, the former editor of Men's Fitness magazine in the UK, thinks the padded shirt is just a gimmick. He thinks many people in the country are obese, or overweight, and should accept they need to do more exercise. Warner says: ""I think it's a real shame people still want shortcuts when it doesn't take an awful lot of effort to get to the gym or go for a walk."" Exercise is always a good thing. But we mustn't forget that beauty is only skin deep. Character is more important than appearance. So before I head off to the pub, it might be worth spending an hour at the gym. I'm not looking to get a six-pack , but looking healthier would certainly improve my confidence and self-esteem. What about you: how much do you worry about your physique?"

According to the research, how do small birds survive from the winter?	Passage 1 Does the early bird catch the worm? No, he saves it for tea: Animals seek out food in the morning but don't tuck in until afternoon. The early bird,strategy was revealed in an experiment in which over 2,000 birds were fitted with tiny radio tags which activated when they landed on feeders hidden in the woods. The feeders were moved around over the course of the day and the researchers noted when the birds landed on them. This revealed that the birds were much better at finding the feeders' new locations in the morning. However, they waited until the afternoon to get tucked in. The researchers said the complex strategy acts as an insurance policy, with birds remaining light yet still able to get enough fat to survive the night. It is particularly important in winter when the risks of predation are high and just one day without food can make the difference between life and death for small birds. Passage 2 What is a place where you could find old pictures of camels carrying people to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and also books about ancient Aztecs in Mexico? It is all found in the World Digital Library (WDL). Its collection is available on the Internet. The library has 8,000 items from whole books to ancient writings, to music and photographs. James Billington, who launched the WDL in 2009, says he wanted it to include items that are both interesting and important. Every item is explained in the 6 official languages of the United Nations: English, Arabic, French, Spanish, Chinese, Russian plus Portuguese. 25 million people have visited the website from 250 places since. Anyone may search the World Digital Library by subject, time period, kind of document or area of the world. The website is www.wdl.org.	['By keeping thin to avoid being caught.']
"When the writer says ""Dick Spivak is just an ordinary man"", he means _ ."	"At 9:00 Dick Spivak's bank telephoned and said his payment was late. ""The check is in the post,"" Dick replied quickly. At 11:45 Dick left for a 12:00 meeting across town. Arriving late, he explained that traffic had been had. That evening, Dick's girlfriend wore a new dress. He hated it. ""It looks just great on you,"" he said. Three lies in one day! Yet Dick Spivak is just an ordinary man. Each time, he told himself that sometimes the truth causes too many problems. Most of us tell much the same white lies, harmless untruths that help to save trouble. How often do we tell white lies? It depends in part on our age, education, and even where we live. According to one U.S. study, women are more truthful than men, and honesty increases as we get older.While most people use little white lies to make life easier, the majority of Americans care about honesty in both public and personal life. They say that people today are less honest than they were ten years ago. Although it is believed that things are getting worse, lying seems to be an age-old human problem. The French philosopher Vauvenarges, writing in the eighteenth century, touched on the truth when he wrote, ""All men are born truthful and die liars ."""	['it is common that people tell white lies']
When Bill started to work in Houston area, he had _ to help him.	It gives me great pleasure today to say a few words in praise of a man we will all miss very much. To be honest, I can't imagine we will do without him when he's gone. Bill Masters almost single-handed built up our sales force in the Houston area and developed the market position that we enjoy today. In only six years, he has brought the firm from a very low fifth position in the area sales to the point where we now outsell all but one of our competitors. Not only have we got 37 per cent of the market under Bill's leadership; we are increasing our share with each passing month. As you know, the company has moved Bill to northern California to work his sales magic in one of this company's most competitive areas. But we know that if anyone can do it, Bill Masters can, and I know you all join me in wishing him the best of luck in his new work.	['very few people']
Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"Remember your first romantic disappointment? Remember the pain and unhappiness of breaking up - the _ ? Winne recalls feeling very sad after her first true love deserted her. Her mother came into her room carrying a beautiful nightgown and handed it to her, gave her a hug and said, ""I know you are feeling heartbroken. I thought you could use something to make you feel beautiful right now."" The nightgown didn't make Winne's hurt go away, but she knew that her mother understood and cared about her feelings. As a parent, as much as you want to make it all better for your teen, give them space. Tell him or her that break - ups are hard and you are there for him or her whenever he or she wants to speak to you. Then let it go. Teenage girls often deal with break - ups by talking on the phone with their friends or diving into the Internet for a long chat. They review all the hurts and pains which are being cured. Boys react to broken relationships differently. Boys often become angry since that, unfortunately, is the only emotional choice that society accepts for boys. Some boys hide their pain. Respect your teen, when a relationship breaks up. It takes time to get over it, and the only way to get through that is to get through it. Sometimes teenagers get into trouble while trying to feel accepted again or win back a loved one. Keep reaching out to troubled teenagers. At first, teens will refuse a parent's attempts to help. Don't be afraid to insist. Teen break - ups can cause heart - wrenching pain , but sooner or later teenagers should be ready to date again. How can you lead your child toward a healthy relationship? Teens are likely to meet others like themselves through activities. The secret to attracting good people is to become your own independent person who feels good about who he or she is and what he or she is about."	"[""Parents shouldn't insist on helping heart - broken children.""]"
The following factors contribute to the boom of wild pigs EXCEPT _ .	"When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin, including Beethoven's Ode to Joy, with the word ""Joy"" changed to ""Freedom"" in the lyrics sung.The orchestra were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .""The pigs are intelligent,"" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. ""They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic."" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin. Pigs within city limits are only shot if they make an immediate threat.No humans have yet been seriously wounded by them, but local dogs have been the victims of their tusks. ""The forestry department is not aiming to get rid of the pigs,"" explains Franusch, ""but we do have to reduce dangerous situations."""	['the Berlin Wall']
The purpose of the passage is to introduce _ .	Watercolour is the oldest paints known. It dates back to the early cave men who discovered they could add lifelike qualities to drawings of animals and other figures on the walls of caves by mixing the natural colours found in the earth with water. Fresco , one of the greatest of all art forms, is done with watercolour. It is created by mixing paints and water and applying these to wet plaster . Of the thousands of people who stand under Michelangelo's heroic ceiling in the Sistine Chapel, very few know that they are looking at perhaps the greatest watercolour painting in the world. The invention of oil painting by the Flemish masters in the fifteenth century made fresco painting go down-hill, and for the next several centuries watercolour was used mainly for doing sketches or as a tool for study. It was not until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that English painters put back watercolour as a serious art form. The English have a widely-known love for outdoors and also small private pictures. The softness of watercolour had a remarkably strong attraction for them. The popularity of watercolour continued to grow until the twentieth century. The United States passed England as the center for watercolour, producing such well-known watercolour artists as Thomas Eakins and Andrew Wyeth.	['the start and development of watercolour']

According to the writer, which should you improve first among the four skills?	If you want to become a fluent English speaker you should take some advice. There are four skills in learning English. They are reading, listening, speaking, and writing. The most important thing you must remember is that if you want to improve your speaking and writing skills, you should first master the skills of reading and listening. Read as much as you can. But your reading must be active. It means that you must think about the meaning of the sentence, the meaning of the unfamiliar words, etc. There is no need for you to pay much attention to grammars or try to understand all the unfamiliar words you _ , but the fact that you see them for the first time and recognize them whenever you see them, for example, in other passages or books, is enough. It would be better to prepare yourself a notebook so you can write down the important words or sentences in it. As for listening, there are two choices: besides reading, you can listen every day for about 30 minutes. You can only pay attention to your reading and become skillful at your reading, then you can catch up on your listening. Since you have lots of inputs in your mind, you can easily guess what the speaker is going to say. This never means that you should not practice listening. For listening you can listen to cartoons or some movies that are specially made for children. Their languages are easy. Or if you are good at listening you can listen to VOA or BBC programs every day. Again the thing to remember is being active in listening and preferably taking some notes. If you follow these pieces of advice, your speaking and writing will improve quickly, and you can be a fluent English speaker one day.	['Reading and listening.']
According to one of his fans, Jay _ .	"Do you want to make friends with a special man? Here is some information about him. He is quiet and shy. He likes to hide his eyes behind his hair. He doesn't smile very often. However, if you talk to him about music, he'll have a lot to say. This is Jay Chou, the 34-year-old Taiwanese pop king . His fans are so excited because he will have a singing party next month. Many pop stars will come, too. Chou grew up just with his mother. He did not talk much and did badly in many school subjects. His mother noticed the boy's special interest in music and sent him to learn piano when he was only three years old. He loved it and kept on practicing. Chou is not very handsome.

The farmer ran away quickly because _ .	"A farmer grew some vegetables in his garden. One day his wife was ill and he had no money. He had to sell some cabbages and carrots in the market. The next morning he took two baskets of vegetables to town. But it was raining hard that afternoon and there were few people in the street. When his vegetables were sold out, it was dark. He bought some medicine and hurried to his village. On his way home he saw a person lying on the snow. He placed his baskets on the ground and was going to help the person to get up. At that time he found it was a dead man and there was much blood on his body. He was so afraid that he ran away quickly, without taking the baskets with him. The next afternoon the farmer was sent to the police station. Having shown the baskets, an officer asked: ""Are these yours?"" ""Yes, sir."" the farmer answered timidly . ""Have you killed the man?"" ""No, no, sir."" the farmer said in a hurry."" When did you see the dead man?"" ""About seven last evening."" ""Did you see who killed the man?"" ""No, Sir.""

"It was a beautiful day at the beach--blue sky, gentle wind, calm sea.I knew these things because a man sitting five feet from me was shouting them into his mobile phone, like a play-by-play announcer . ""IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY,"" he shouted.""THE SKY IS BLUE, AND THERE'S A GENTLE WIND, AND THE WATER IS CALM, AND..."" Behind me, a woman, her mobile phone pressed to her ear was walking back and forth. ""She DIDN'T,"" she was saying.""No.She DIDN'T.She DID? Really? Are you SERIOUS? She did NOT.She DID? No she..."" And so on.This woman had two children, who were playing in the sea.I found myself watching them, because the woman surely was not.A huge squid could have caught and snatched the children, and this woman would not have noticed.Or, if she had noticed, she'd have said, ""Listen.I have to go, because a huge squid just......No! She didn't ! She DID? No! She......"" And next to me, the play-by-play man would have said: ""...AND A HUGE SQUID JUST ATE TWO CHILDREN, AND I'M GETTING A LITTLE SUNBURNED, AND ...""

Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"There was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard. He was very hardworking, and the farm always prospered under his care. But he knew that his three sons despised the farm work, and were eager to make wealth, through adventure. When the farmer was old, and felt that his time had come to die, he called the three sons to him and said, ""My sons, there is a pot of gold hidden in the olive orchard. Dig for it, if you wish it."" The sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the gold was hidden, but he would tell them nothing more. After the farmer was dead, the sons went to work to find the pot of gold. Since they did not know where the hiding-place was, they agreed to begin in a line, at one end of the orchard, and to dig until one of them should find the money. They dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other, round the tree-roots and between them. But no pot of gold was to be found. It seemed as if someone must have stolen it, or as if the farmer had been wandering in his wits. The three sons were bitterly disappointed to have all their work for nothing. The next olive season, the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit than they had ever given. When it was sold, it gave the sons a whole pot of gold. And when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they suddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he said, ""There is gold hidden in the orchard. Dig for it, if you wish it."""
