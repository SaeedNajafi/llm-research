"Question: Van der Lee and Ellemers' study shows that _ . Context: Women are still underrepresented in top academic positions. One of the possible explanations for this is the increasing importance of obtaining research funding. Women are often less successful in this than men. Psychology researchers Dr. Romyvan der Lee and professor Naomi Ellemers investigated whether this difference also occurs at the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and examined potential explanations. The researchers were assigned by NWO to carry out this study as part of the broader evaluation of NWO's procedures and its gender diversity policy. The aim was to gain more insight into the causes of the differences in awarding rates for male and female applicants for research funding. The analysis addressed an important ""talent programme"" of NWO, the Veni grant. ""Whoever receives this grant has a greater chance of obtaining an important appointment at a university,""says Naomi Ellemers. Van der Lee and Ellemers investigated all the applications submitted by male and female researchers over a period of three years: a total of 2823 applications. Under the direction of NWO these applications were assessed by scientific committees consisting of men and women. The results demonstrate that the awarding rates for female applicants (14.9%) are systematically lower than those for male applicants (17.7%). ""If we compare the proportion of women among the applicants with the proportion of women among those awarded funding, we see a loss of 4%,"" said Ellemers. The study reveals that women are less positively evaluated for their qualities as researcher than men are. ""Interestingly the research proposals of women and men are evaluated equally positively. In other words, the reviewers see no difference in the quality of the proposals that men and women submit,"" says Romy van der Lee. In search for a possible cause for the differences in awarding rates and evaluations, the researchers also investigated the language use in the instructions and forms used to assess the quality of applications. This clearly revealed the occurrence of gendered language. The words that are used to indicate quality are frequently words that were established in previous research as referring mainly to the male gender stereotype (such as challenging and excellent). Romy van der Lee explains: ""As a result, it appears that men more easily satisfy the assessment criteria, because these better fit the characteristics stereotypically associated with men."" In response to the results of this research, NWO will devote more attention to the gender awareness of reviewers in its methods and procedures. It will also be investigated which changes to the assessment procedures and criteria can most strongly contribute to more equal chances for men and women to obtain research funding. This will include an examination of the language used by NWO. NWO chair Jos Engelens said, ""The research has yielded valuable results and insights. Based on the recommendations made by the researchers we will therefore focus in the coming period on the development of evidence-based measures to reduce the difference in awarding rates."" </s>"	the research proposals of women are equally treated with those of men </s>
"Question: If a man loses the ability to recognize his right side, _ . Context: When you close your eyes and try to think of the shape of your own body, what you imagine (or rather, what you feel) is quite different from what you see when you open your eyes and look in the mirror. The image you feel is much vaguer than the one you see. And if you lie still, it is quite hard to imagine yourself as having any particular size or shape. When you move, when you feel the weight of your arms and legs and the natural resistance of the objects around you, the ""felt"" image of yourself starts to become clearer. It is almost as if it were created by your own actions and the feelings they cause. The image you create for yourself has rather strange proportions ; certain parts feel much larger than they look. If you get a hole in one of your teeth, it feels enormous; you are often surprised by how small it looks when you inspect it in the mirror. Although the ""felt"" image may not have the shape you see in the mirror, it is much more important. It is the image through which you recognize your physical existence in the world. In spite of its strange proportions, it is all one piece, and since it has a consistent right and left and a top and bottom, it allows you to locate new feelings when they occur. It allows you to find your nose in the dark and point to a pain. If the felt image is damaged for any reason--if it is cut in half or lost as it often is after certain strokes which wipe out recognition of one entire side -these tasks become almost impossible. What is more, it becomes hard to make sense of one's own visual appearance. If one half of the ""felt"" image is wiped out or injured, the patient stops recognizing the affected part of his body. It is hard for him to find the location of feelings on that side, and, although he feels the doctor's touch, he locates it as being on the undamaged side. </s>"	he can't locate the doctor's touch on his right side </s>
"Question: How did the seed feel after hearing the traveler's words at last? Context: A long time ago, there was a seed and because he was only a seed, nobody noticed him. Thus, feeling inferior , the seed gave no importance to his existence . Then one day, a wind picked him up and threw him on an open field in the sun. Later, he was given rain. Years later he saw a traveler sitting by his side. ""Thank you God for this. I really need some rest,"" he heard the traveler say. ""What are you talking about?"" the seed quickly asked. He thought the man was making fun of him. No one ever spoke to him like that. ""Who just spoke?"" the shocked man asked. ""It is me. A seed."" ""A seed?"" The man looked at the big tree. ""Are you joking? You are not a seed. You are a big tree!"" ""Really?"" ""Yes! Why else do you think people come here?"" ""What do they come here for?"" ""To feel your shade ! Don't tell me you didn't know you had grown over time."" A moment passed before the traveler's words brought him pride. The seed thought and smiled for the first time in his life. The years of torture by the sun and the rain finally helped him grow up. ""Oh! That means I'm not a little seed anymore! I was actually born to make people feel comfortable. Wow! That's great!"" </s>"	Proud. </s>
"Question: Why are the English abbreviations becoming more and more popular according to the passage? Context: Does technology pose a threat to the purity of Chinese language? Many Chinese use instant messenger tools such as MSN or QQ, listen to music on MP3 players and log on the Internet using ADSL--most without knowing the literal Chinese translation of the abbreviations . But they don't have to, as many English letters have become part of the local vocabulary. A dozen abbreviations including GDP, NBA, IT, MP3, QQ, DVD and CEO are among the 5,000 most-frequently used words in the Chinese media last year, according to a report on the 2006 Language Situation in China. The report said some parents are so keen on English letters that a couple tried to name their baby ""@"", claiming the character used in email addresses reflects their love for the child. While the ""@""is obviously familiar to Chinese e-mail users, they often use the English word ""at"" to pronounce it ""ai ta"",or ""love him"". The study collected more than 1 billion language samples from newspapers, magazines, TV, radio and websites. The annual report is jointly compiled by the Ministry of Education and the State Language Commission. ""Nowadays, more and more English abbreviations are being used in Chinese, making them an important part of modern language,"" said Hou Min, a professor at Communication University of China. ""The abbreviations have gained popularity because of the ease of usage,"" Hou said. For example, DNA is much simpler to use than its Chinese version. ""As more Chinese people learn foreign languages, especially English, in recent years, using abbreviations has become a trend among educated people,"" she added. Some language scholars fear such usage will contaminate the purity of Chinese and cause confusion in communication. </s>"	Because English abbreviations are easy and simple to use. </s>
"Question: According to Ken Drew and Dr. Patel, people get slightly constipated and have heart pain because _ . Context: Quickly ask yourself: What did you eat today? Now tell me how you actually feel. If you're complaining of stress, anxiety, depression, aches and pains, foggy thinking, or just a general lack of energy, a new medical theory will blow your mind. The chances are that those disease-like symptoms are all the result of what's called hidden food allergies . This is what Ken Drew found out when he was lucky enough to be recommended to medical practitioner Dr. Patel. Patel is considered something of a genius, and has been called a modern day Louis Pasteur. You've heard of him, of course--Pasteur figured out how to keep milk from getting spoiled. Dr. Patel is like a Louis Pasteur for keeping your body from getting spoiled from chronic diseases. ""Foggy thinking, slightly constipated , heart pain,...you name it. It's part of getting old,"" you say. ""It's just stress."" Most of the body's immune defenses are all located in your stomach, so when you have a hidden food allergy and you expose yourself to harmful foods, your defenses malfunction and disease-carrying bacteria take over. Had you not eaten that one food you were allergic to for breakfast, you would never have got sick. Together, Dr Patel and Ken Drew have developed the Reverse My Disease program, which claims it can _ your body against diseases like arthritis , Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease and cancers. You won't need a prescription and there isn't any kind of medical procedure involved. There's no medical jargon, no complicated diet to do. What it does do is claim to tell you how to hack your body's natural defense system. Dr. Patel has remained under the radar of the entire medical establishment because his ideas are so threatening to doctors who don't want you to stop being sick enough for them to write you prescriptions. Those doctor visits cost you, so check out Reverse My Disease if you want to prevent disease by learning how to eat food that won't harm your body. </s>"	they don't eat the right food. </s>
"Question: Which of the following contributes to the emergence of musical prodigies according to the passage? Context: Violin prodigies , I learned, have come in distinct waves from distinct regions. Most of the great performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were born and brought up in Russia and Eastern Europe. I asked Isaac Stern, one of the world's greatest violinists the reason for this phenomenon. ""It is very clear,"" he told me. ""They were all Jews and Jews at the time were severely oppressed and ill-treated in that part of the world. They were not allowed into the professional fields, but they were allowed to achieve excellence on a concert stage."" As a result, every Jewish parent's dream was to have a child in the music school because it was a passport to the West. Another element in the emergence of prodigies, I found, is a society that values excellence in a certain field to nurture talent. Nowadays, the most nurturing societies seem to be in the Far East. ""In Japan, a most competitive society, with stronger discipline than ours,"" says Isaac Stern, children are ready to test their limits every day in many fields, including music. When Western music came to Japan after World War II, that music not only became part of their daily lives, but it became a discipline as well. The Koreans and Chinese as we know are just as highly motivated as the Japanese. That's a good thing, because even prodigies must work hard. Next to hard work, biological inheritance plays an important role in the making of a prodigy. J. S. Bach, for example, was the top of several generations of musicians, and four of his sons had significant careers in music. </s>"	a natural gift. </s>
"Question: We can learn from the passage that Benjamin Franklin _ . Context: Everyone knows the story of Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment. He was a man of many gifts and interests. His natural curiosity about things made him try to find ways to make them work better. Although he made important discoveries, Ben didn't ""invent"" electricity. He did, however, invent the lightning rod which protected buildings and ships from lightning damage. In America, most people warmed their homes by building a fire in a fireplace even though it was kind of dangerous and used a lot of wood. Ben said that he had another better way. His invented an iron stove which allowed people to warm their home less dangerously and with less wood. The stove that he invented is called a Franklin stove. Ben also set up the first fire company and the first fire insurance company in order to help people live more safely. As the postmaster, Ben had to find out the best way for delivering the mail. He went out riding in his carriage to measure the routes and needed a way to record the miles. He invented a simple _ for it. In his old age, Ben retired from business and public service and wanted to spend his time reading and studying. He found, however, that his old age had made it difficult for him to reach books from the high shelves. Even though he had many grandchildren to help him, he invented a tool called a long arm to reach the high books. The long arm was a long wooden pole with a grasping claw at the end. Later, other famous inventors, like Thomas A. Edison and Alexander Graham Bell, would follow in Ben's footsteps by trying to find ways to help people live better. Today's curious thinkers are keeping Ben's traditions alive by inventing new and improved ways to make things work. </s>"	set up some companies to help people to live better </s>

Question: Fresh bamboo shoots are easily found in _ . Context: Bamboo is a giant grass that grows in warm places. It has many uses. Everything--from chairs and fishing rods to basket and paper can be made from it. And that's not all. It can be eaten, too. People in China like bamboo shoots very much. They think the bamboo shoots are a delicious vegetable for parties and meals. In many parts of Asia, bamboo shoots are a favorite food. The winter shoots are the best because they are soft, with a white and green color. Usually they are boiled in water with some salt. Spring shoots are darker and harder, so they take longer to cook. But they are cheaper than winter shoots. Fresh bamboo shoots are seldom found outside bamboos' hometown. But people in other places can buy bamboo shoots, too. These shoots are kept in bottles and cans. They need no cooking and are almost as good as fresh bamboo shoots. </s>	Asia </s>

"Question: _ is grown in Yang Lin's hometown. Context: Many young Chinese people drink coffee when meeting with friends. Yang Lin lives in the U.S. but comes from an area in China famous for growing tea. She used to only drink tea while in China. But now, she says, she drinks both and for different reasons. ""I would say ... I was a tea drinker when I was in China. But now, you know, with the influence of different holiday drinks ... I think I like coffee as well as tea now."" Yang Lin says that drinking coffee for her is a social event. She and her workmates like to sit in a cafe and talk over a cup of coffee. Tea, she says, is more about family memories. She grew up in Fujian Province -- an area known for its tea. Ms. Yang says that as a child, her family would get together in the evening and talk about the day's events over a pot of tea. So now, even the smell of Fujian tea brings back these warm family memories. Voyo is another Chinese woman who now lives in Washington D.C. She says that after moving to the U.S. her tastes changed.

"Question: Compared to the clear words of her boyfriend on screen, his accent becomes _ . Context: After too long on the Net, even a phone call can be a shock. My boyfriend's Liverpudlian accent suddenly becomes too difficult to understand after his clear words on screen; a secretary's tone seems more rejecting than I'd imagined it would be. Time itself becomes fluid--hours become minutes, and alternately seconds stretch into days. Weekends, once a highlight of my week, are now just two ordinary days. For the last three years, since I stopped working as a producer for Charlie Rose, I have done much of my work as a tele-commuter. I submit articles and edit them by E-mail and communicate with colleagues on Internet mailing lists. My boyfriend lives in England; so much of our relationship is computer-mediated. If I desired, I could stay inside for weeks without wanting anything. I can order food, and manage my money, love and work. In fact, at times I have spent as long as three weeks alone at home, going out only to get mail and buy newspapers and groceries. I watched most of the blizzard of '96 on TV. But after a while, life itself begins to feel unreal. I start to feel as though I've merged with my machines, taking data in, spitting them back out, just another node on the Net. Others on line report the same symptoms. We start to strongly dislike the outside forms of socializing. It's like attending an A. A. meeting in a bar with everyone holding a half-sipped drink. We have become the Net opponents' worst nightmare. What first seemed like a luxury, crawling from bed to computer, not worrying about hair, and clothes and face, has become an avoidance ,a lack of discipline. And once you start replacing real human contact with cyber interaction, _ can be quite difficult. At times, I turn on the television and just leave it to chatter in the background, something that I'd never done previously. The voices of the programs relax me, but then I'm jarred by the commercials. I find myself sucked in by soap operas, or needing to keep up with the latest news and the weather.

"Question: We can infer from the passage _ . Context: My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening near my parents' tomb in the churchyard. ""Hold your noise!"" came a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the tombs at the side of the church. ""Keep still, you little devil , or I'll cut your throat!""

Sure, it has beautiful blooms in the spring, but then it gets a disease, the leaves curl, and it drops those little apples that sit on the driveway. Each passing week he pronounced the tree dead. Eventually I began to believe him. Though he agreed it would be a regrettable loss, there was a twinkle in his eye. He armed himself a couple of weeks ago and began trimming. A branch here, a branch there, a small limb, then a large limb. I watched and then decided to check the wood on some of the branches closer to the trunk. I broke one off and saw green. The crab apple was not dead. It just hadn't had time to leaf out. The tree was now falling to one side, but it was not dead. I would have told him so, but he had moved on to a maple. Once the man starts, he can't stop. One trim leads to another. ""Please, stop!"" I called.

It might even help you to get things done too. The more you have to do, the more you need a list and few people with high-powered jobs get by without them. Women always think they're better at lists than men. Men tend to have tasks which they assemble 'into Action Plans whereas women just have lists of Things To Do. James Oliver, psychologist, has created his own ""time management matrix "". He writes a list of things to do and then organizes them into _ : things that have to be done straight away, other things that it would be good to do today, things that are important but haven't got to be done immediately and things that are less urgent but that he doesn't want to forget. ""Using categories to order the world is the way the human mind works,"" he says. ""After that, you should divide things into levels of importance."" But he also warns, ""If people get too absorbed in making lists, it doesn't work. They have too many categories and lose their ability to decide which is the most important.""

"Question: How do scientists know ""Motherhood may make women smarter""? Context: Motherhood may make women smarter and may help prevent dementia in old age by bathing the brain in protective hormones , U.S.researchers reported on Thursday. Tests on rats show that those who raise two or more litters of pups do considerably better in tests of memory and skills than rats who have no babies, and their brains show changes that suggest they may be protected against diseases such as Alzheimer's .University of Richmond psychology professor Craig Kinsley believes his findings will translate into humans.""Our research shows that the hormones of pregnancy are protecting the brain, including estrogen , which we know has many neuroprotective effects,"" Kinsley said. ""It's rat data but humans are mammals just like these animals are mammals,"" he added in a telephone interview.""They go through pregnancy and hormonal changes."" Kinsley said he hoped public health officials and researchers will look to see if having had children protects a woman from Alzheimer's and other forms of age-related brain decline. ""When people think about pregnancy, they think about what happens to babies and the mother from the neck down,"" said Kinsley, who presented his findings to the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in Orlando, Florida. ""They do not realize that hormones are washing on the brain.If you look at female animals that have never gone through pregnancy, they act differently toward young.But if she goes through pregnancy, she will sacrifice her life for her infant--that is a great change in her behavior that showed in genetic alterations to the brain."" </s>"	They know it by experimenting on rats. </s>
"Question: The author described the Miller's behavior in order to _ . Context: Hans was an honest fellow with a funny round good-humored face. Living alone, every day he worked in his garden. In all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his. All sorts of flowers grew there, blooming in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to see, and pleasant odors to smell. Hans had many friends, the most devoted being the Miller. So devoted was the rich Miller to Hans that he'd never go by his garden without plucking a large bunch of flowers or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with fruits. The Miller used to talk about noble ideas, and Hans nodded and smiled, feeling proud of having such a friend. The neighbors thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave Hans anything in return, though he had hundreds of sacks of flour, many cows and sheep, but Hans never troubled his head about these, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things about the unselfishness of true friendship. In spring, summer, and autumn Hans was very happy, but when winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to sell, he suffered from cold and hunger. Though extremely lonely, the Miller never came to see him then. ""There's no good in going to see Hans while the snow lasts."" The Miller said to his wife, ""When people are in trouble they shouldn't be bothered. So I'll wait till the spring comes when he's happy to give me flowers."" ""You're certainly very thoughtful,"" answered his wife, ""It's quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship."" ""Couldn't we ask Hans up here?"" said their son. ""I'll give him half my meal, and show him my white rabbits."" ""How silly you are!"" cried the Miller. ""I really don't know what's the use of sending you to school. If Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, our good supper, and our red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I am his best friend, and I'll always watch over him, and see that he's not led into any temptation. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me for some flour. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they shouldn't be confused. The words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that."" He looked seriously at his son, who felt so ashamed that he hung his head down, and grew quite scared, and began to cry into his tea. Spring coming, the Miller went down to see Hans. Again he talked about friendship. ""Hans, friendship never forgets. I'm afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. See, how lovely your roses are!"" Hans said he wanted to sell them in the market to buy back his things which were sold during the hard time of the winter. ""I'll give you many good things. I think being generous is the base of friendship."" said the Miller. ""And now, as I'll give you many good things, I'm sure you'd like to give me some flowers in return. Here's the basket, and fill it quite full."" Poor Hans was afraid to say anything. He ran and plucked all his pretty roses, and filled the Miller's basket, imagining the many good things promised by the Miller. The next day he heard the Miller calling: ""Hans, would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?"" ""I'm sorry, but I am really very busy today."" ""Well,"" said the Miller, ""considering that I'm going to give you my things, it's rather unfriendly of you to refuse. Upon my word, you mustn't mind my speaking quite plainly to you."" Poor Hans was driven by his friendship theory to work hard for his best friend, leaving his garden dry and wasted. One evening Hans was sitting by fire when the Miller came. ""Hans,"" cried the Miller, ""My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I'm going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it's such a bad windy night. It has just occurred to me that you can go instead of me. You know I'm going to give you my good things, so you should do something for me in return."" ""Certainly,"" cried Hans. He struggled into the stormy night, and got the doctor to ride a horse to the Miller's house in time to save the boy. However, Hans got lost in the darkness, and wandered off into a deep pool, drowned. At Hans' funeral, the Miller said, ""I was his best friend. I should walk at the head of the procession."" Every now and then he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief. </s>"	warn the readers about the danger of a false friend </s>
"Question: What is the author's attitude towards the government? Context: Half a year ago I came across a book called""Salt,Sugar and Fat. How the Food Giants Hooked US"",but finished it only recently. I am far from being a fan of junk food,over-salty,or over-sweet stuff,and honestly this food doesn't appeal to me at all. Maybe it is related to the fact that I grew up in Russia and at that time we were not so exposed to the foreign, especially made in America foods. We knew Coca Cola,Pepsi,juice powder and Cheetos,but this stuff was not so cheap or available to buy it every day and we couldn't buy them in large quantities. We didn't know the word""fat""was not a bad thing but a normal of life for some people. We always had sweets and especially on holidays they were served as a dessert along with a cake. Russians like eating sweets when they drink tea. Even with my passion to desserts I still can'trelate myself to the people Michale Moss was writing about, those consumers who could not say""no"" when it came to junk food. What I found interesting in the book was that the author didn't focus on diets, necessity to exercise,sleep well at night and all other things we all are pretty aware of. The aim was not to teach people how to live but instead,after having made a huge research,interviewed more than 100 people in the food industry,Moss reveals the ugly of the food business. It puts all the facts in front of us and offers a choice:to buy or not to buy. However,the answer was known at the very beginning. Moss mentions the well-known food like Coca,Cola,Pepsi,Nestle and some others and tells how skillfully the consumers can be cheated when it comes to choosing what to put in the food basket in the supermarket. We like this taste of a chocolate,the crispy chips,and sweet porridges because it was all put on test by groups of scientists who made experiments to reveal what kind of taste will be most appealing to us. It involves brain,of course. Apart from scientific researches, it was also due to successful marketing strategies and plans that people prefer to buy food. In this companies'money race,the most vulnerable victims are kids. They can't tell good from bad and love everything that makes them feel good. Commercial ads of fast food particularly targeted kids and played on the fact that mothers can't fully control what their children eat because they spent all day at work. Mothers themselves buy chocolates bars and com flakes for their kids,guided by a powerful brainwashing that actually,these products were not unhealthy, on the contrary, it was encouraged to give them to kids, because fat and sugar provide energy, so they are good,right? Giving a credit to some food companies, they made attempts to fight the trend, but consumers,who already worked a habit of eating too salty, too fatting and too sweet products,didn't react to the changes. So the companies returned to the old policy. Surprisingly,such behavior was strongly backed up by the govermment. I would definitely recommend reading this book not only to those who struggle in the battle with his addiction to fast food but also people living healthily. It casts light on many things,including how vulnerable we can be in front of corporations and their powerful and accurate marketing strategies. </s>"	negative </s>

"Question: What would be the best title for this passage? Context: Babies are born yogis. Once we were all able to pull our toes up by our ears and laugh about it. Then we aged, got injured, and began carrying stress in our shoulders and back. In short, we lost our balance. Yoga is an ancient practice that helps create a sense of union in body, mind, and spirit. It brings us balance. I was seriously out of balance when I started practicing yoga in 1999. I had plantar facilities in both feet, and my doctor had warned me against all the things I loved to do: walking, hiking, and playing tennis. I was desperate for exercise. Yoga became my salvation and even enhanced my other fitness activities. I practice yoga at least twice a week, but I consider yoga to be part of my daily life because after a while you no longer just practice yoga--you love it. Yoga becomes part of your physical life. Your body grows stronger, more toned, and more flexible as you move from one pose to the other. I spent a week in Mexico at a yoga retreat, and it was the first vacation on which I lost weight. ""Rather than building muscle, yoga builds muscle tone,"" says Shakta Kaur Khalsa, author of the K.I.S.S. Guide to Yoga. ""Because yoga helps maintain a balanced metabolism , it also helps to regulate weight. Additionally, yoga stretches muscles lengthwise, causing fat to be removed around the cells."" I do yoga poses throughout the day. After hours at my computer, I stretch my stiff shoulders and arms. When I need a boost of energy, I do energizing poses. When I am feeling exhausted at the end of the day, I do restorative poses. Yoga becomes part of your mental life. Yoga teaches you to focus on breathing while you hold the poses. This attention to breath is calming; it dissolves stress and anxiety. I use yogic breathing on the tennis courts, in the dentist's chair, and in traffic jams. You should always leave a yoga practice feeling energized, not tired. If you feel tired after yoga, it means you spent the time ""fighting"" yourself, trying to force yourself into poses. In yoga, you ""surrender"" to the pose by letting go of the tension. Yoga becomes part of your spiritual life. Yoga is practiced by people from all religions; it is not restricted to any religious group. Yoga teaches ""right"" living in how we deal with ourselves and others. As I work on a difficult pose, I learn patience, forgiveness, and the value of gentleness. Yoga advocates proper eating, but you don't have to be a vegetarian to practice yoga. </s>"	The Benefits of Yoga </s>

"Question: ""Marine cloud whitening"" has an effect on global warming by _ . Context: Special ships that create clouds by sending seawater into the air could be the cheapest way of dealing with climate change, new research has found. The technique, known as ""marine cloud whitening"", would create clouds above the Pacific Ocean that would have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight away from Earth. Nearly 2,000 wind-powered ships would cross the sea, getting seawater and sending it up through tall tubes. "" When you send saltwater into the air, you create bigger and whiter clouds, and thus reflect more sunlight back into space,"" said David Young from the group of the study. The paper by Professor Eric Bickel and Lee Lane looked into the costs of the projects. It found that cloud whitening would reduce the effects of climate change this century for no more than PS5.3 billion. This is only a small part of the PS150 billion that leading nations are considering spending to cut CO2 emissions each year. It is also more than 25 times cheaper than the PS140 billion cost of another project which would copy the cooling effect of volcanoes. The authors also compared the cost benefits that reducing temperatures would have. They found every PS1 spend on other ways would have PS15 of benefits, however every PS1 spent on cloud whitening would bring PS2,000 of benefits. These would include the human costs on health and the influence on other fields. David Young said, ""Marine cloud whitening could achieve as much for the planet as CO2cuts would, but with much less cost."" But he warned that these techniques shouldn't be considered as a long-period way to deal with climate change. "" It's important to note that this technique wouldn't reduce CO2emissions or deal with the causes of global warming, but would cover its effects."" he said. </s>"	cutting sunlight </s>

It seems that this rate of inflation is tending to rise rather than to fall.If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices,one might think that inflation does not matter.But it does when money is losing value,it lacks one of the qualities of a good money---stability of value.It is no longer acceptable as a store of value;and it becomes an unsuitable standard of deferred payments.Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession,so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible.

"Question: By saying ""The happy childhood is hardly worth your while"", the writer really means that_. Context: ""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood. The happy childhood is hardly worth your while. ""Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood. And worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" That was Frank McCourt reading the opening lines of his book Angela's Ashes, released in nineteen ninety-six. This Irish American author best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography Angela's Ashes that recorded his poor upbringing, died of cancer on Sunday, The New York Times reported. He was 78. Born in New York City, he was the eldest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents. Angela's Ashes was a memoir that captured an irresponsible, drunkard father with a gift for story-telling. When not drunk, his father was absent, turning his back on a family so poor, McCourt wrote, that they were reduced to burning the furniture in their rented hut to keep warm. His mother struggled to raise her many children after his father left the family. Already struggling when the Great Depression hit, the family moved back to Limerick, where they slipped ever deeper into poverty in the 1930s. Three of McCourt's siblings died of diseases worsened by hunger and the wretchedness of their surroundings. McCourt himself almost died of typhoid fever as a child. In Angela's Ashes, he wrote of hunger, a home flooded with rainwater and the unbearable humiliation of seeking handouts from charities in the Irish city. But he told the story in a way that is expressive, warm and light-hearted. Frank McCourt left Ireland at the age of nineteen to return to New York City where he was born. He earned a degree in- English education and taught creative writing for nearly thirty years. After retiring in nineteen eighty-seven, he decided to write about his childhood. ""Angela's Ashes"" became a huge success and brought McCourt a 1997 Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award and other honors. Millions of copies of the book were sold worldwide and it was adapted into a 1999 movie starring Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle. </s>"	smooth childhood surely will not draw readers' attention </s>

Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage? Context: You've probably heard of Marco Polo, but how much do you actually know about him and his incredible journey? Marco was the original travel writer, whose trade contacts with Asia changed Europe, opening it up to new ideas and cultures. Marco Polo was born in the Venetian Republic around 1254.At the time, Venice was one of the most powerful trading cities in the world, and was ruled as an independent city state.Marco's mother died when he was young, so he was brought up by his aunt and uncle.When Marco was born, his brother (Maffeo) and father (Niccolo), who were successful merchants, were away on a trading voyage.They didn't get back until Marco was about 15. In 1271, Niccolo and Maffeo set off again for Asia, this time taking Marco with them.On a previous journey they'd met Kublai Khan (the Yuan Dynasty), and they were keen to establish trade links between Kublai's empire and Venice.The Polos sailed across the Mediterranean to Acre (now in northern Israel).Then, they traveled by camel to the port of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.Their plan was to sail to China but they couldn't find any good boats.So, they continued the journey overland, finally meeting Kublai Khan at his summer palace in Xanadu, about 275 kms north of modern Beijing.Marco was now probably 21 years ol The journey had taken over three years. The Polos had learnt a great deal about the world during their travels and so Kublai employed Marco as a government official.This gave Marco the opportunity to travel around much of Kublai's empire in China.In fact, Kublai found the Polos so useful that he was unwilling to let them return home.However, in 1292, the Polos eventually left, sailing from China and ending up in Hormuz again.The journey was extremely dangerous: of the 600 travelers who set off, only 18 arrived in Hormuz, including all three of the Polo family. The Polos finally returned to Venice in 1295, twenty-four years after setting off.They had traveled 24,000 kms.By this time Venice was at war with Genoa, its trade rival.Unfortunately for Marco, he was captured by the Genoese and imprisione However, he used his time as a prisoner to write a book about his family's travels: II Milione (known as The Travels of Marco Polo in English).It was the first book to tell Europeans about China and the East.No original copy survives, but there are several versions of it.Marco's writings influenced many other travelers, most notably Christopher Columbus, who carried a copy of II Milione with him on his voyage in search of Asia. After his release from prison in 1299, Marco rejoined his father and uncle in Venice.The family were now even wealthier than before thanks to the many treasures they'd brought back from the East.Marco financed many more trading journeys but never left the city again.He died in 1324 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice. </s>	Marco spent about six years on the way to China and back to Venice. </s>
Question: What can we learn from the passage? Context: Once upon a time, a boy was walking through a wood and he thought he could hear a sad cry.

Amused by this, the boy tried to catch one of these incredible talking fish. But when he stuck his arm into the water it turned grey right up to the elbow. As this happened, a huge sadness entered into him, and he suddenly understood how sad the fish were feeling. He quickly pulled his arm out of the water, and ran from that place. But the arm stayed grey, and the boy continued feeling sad. He tried so many times to cheer himself up, but nothing worked.

"Question: What can we learn about the U.S. Government from the shutdown? Context: The United States government is back in business. Early Thursday morning, President Barack Obama signed a bill to reopen the government. The budget bill, drafted by Senate late on Wednesday night, raised the government's debt ceiling and averted a serious economic crisis. ""With the shutdown behind us,"" Obama said after the Senate vote, ""we now have an opportunity to focus on a sensible budget that is responsible, that is fair and that helps hardworking people all across this country."" Now that a settlement has been reached, formerly furloughed employees have returned to work, national museums and parks are reopening, and the government's gears are slowly beginning to turn again. Before the shutdown, a federal funding bill went back and forth between the Senate and the House. A major issue was whether or not the government would pay for changes in Obama's healthcare plan. The Senate, with a Democratic majority, wanted to pass a budget that would fund the new healthcare law. But the House, which has a Republican majority, did not want government money used that way. Because an agreement could not be reached on a budget plan, the government was forced to partially shut down. Sixteen days later, _ have come together to pass a measure that raised the country's debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is the strict legal limit Congress places on the amount of money that can be borrowed each year. Had this agreement not been met by October 17, the U.S. may not have been able to pay its promised payments. This legislation, or law, will fund the government through January 15. During this time, Obama and Congress will work on a long-term spending plan. The effects of the two-week government shutdown were widespread. In addition to national parks, museums, memorials and monuments were off-limits to visitors. Workers at government-run organizations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency were furloughed. Part of the new legislation will pay back the 800,000 workers who were without pay during the shutdown. Early Thursday, the Smithsonian Institution celebrated the government's reopening on Twitter. ""We're back from the shutdown!"" they wrote, announcing that museums would reopen Thursday and the National Zoo in Washington on Friday. To the delight of many people, that also means the return of the zoo's popular live Panda camera. </s>"	It is affected by different political forces. </s>
Question: What do you think the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is? Context: Researchers found that people become happier and experience less worry after they reach the age of fifty. In fact, they say by the age of eighty-five, people are happier with their life than they were when they were eighteen years old. The findings came from a survey of more than three hundred forty thousand adults in the United States. The Gallup Organization questioned them by telephone in two thousand eight. At that time, the people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five. The researchers asked questions about emotions like happiness, sadness and worry. They also asked about mental or emotional stress. Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five. The findings showed that stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties. Happiness was highest among the youngest adults and those in their early seventies. The people least likely to report feeling negative emotions were those in their seventies and eighties. The findings appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers say they do not know why happiness increases as people get older. One theory is that, as people grow older, they grow more thankful for what they have and have better control of their emotions. They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences. Professor Stone says the emotional patterns could be linked to changes in how people see the world, or maybe even changes in brain chemistry. The researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single. But they found that influences like these did not affect the levels of happiness and well-being related to age. The study also showed that men and women have similar emotional patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men. </s>	A popular science magazine. </s>

Question: Christmas Eve is _ . Context: On Christmas Eve, the night before Christmas Day, children are very happy. They put their stockings at the end of their beds before they go to bed. They want Father Christmas to give some presents. Father Christmas is a very kind man. He comes on Christmas Eve. He lands on top of each house and comes down the chimney into the fireplace and brings children a lot of presents. Christmas Day always begins before breakfast. Children wake up very early. They can't wait to open the presents in their stockings. Then they wake up their parents and shout 'Merry Christmas!' Do you know what Christmas means? Christmas Day is the birthday of Jesus Christ.

Question: According to the passage, people like bouldering because _ . Context: About nine million people like rock climbing in America. Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous. Expert rock climbers say only the very best in the sport should do it. </s>	it is simpler than other kinds </s>
"Question: Why was Buster so confident? Context: Buster Brown was a thief and a good one too, he thought. He'd never been caught by the police because he never took chances. He was always prepared for any unforeseen event or emergency. Confidently, he stood outside the house of his intended victim and read the sign on the front gate of the house. ""Don't worry about the dog--be aware of the owner!"" it said. Buster smiled and found his way in. The house looked quite normal outside, but inside it was very _ with fascinating objects on show. As he began putting them into his bag, a dog came into the room. It stopped when it saw Buster, then wagged its tail madly and went over to him, licking his outstretched hand. ""Good boy, ""Buster whispered. ""What a great guard dog you are--trying to lick me to death."" Satisfied he'd made friends with the dog, Bluster began to wander round the house, choosing items to put in his bag. His skilled eye picked out only the best antiques :a pair of silver candle holders, a silver tea-and-coffee service, etc. . His new friend, the dog, sat and watched, as if wondering what was happening. ""Well, boy,"" Buster whispered, finally. ""That might do. Any more and I won't be able to carry it! "" He swung the heavy bag onto his shoulders, just as the lights came on, nearly blinding him. He shielded his eyes with his hand. ""You're a very silly person,"" the figure in the doorway said, his voice dry and dust. As the man came closer, Buster could see he was well dressed. His face seemed familiar, but Buster couldn't quite place where he had seen him before. ""You should have taken more notice of the sign outside,"" the man rasped. ""I knew about this attempted robbery last week and I also know you will end up behind bars for 20 years.

"Question: A student who likes reading about heroes will probably read _ . Context: Once upon a time, a doting mother asked Albert Einstein what she should read to her son to help him grow up as brilliant and intelligent as the famous scientist. ""Fairy-tales,"" he said, wisely nodding his head. Why? Why would Albert Einstein -- the Nobel Prizes winning physicist recommend reading fairy-tales? Was he joking? All the evidence suggests he was deadly serious. He also said, ""When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than any talent for abstract, positive thinking."" Childhood is one of the factors that blur the distinctions between the self and other objects. Thus fantasy stories appeal to children and appear to make sense to them. There are several commonly accepted genres of fantasy, ""Animal Fantasy"" which centers around the lives of lovable talking animals and ""Modern Fantasy"" which focuses on adventures in other worlds and magical events. I am inclined to add a third genre ""Human and Animal Fantasy"", which mixes human and animal characters. Another genre of fantasy may be ""High Fantasy"" which features heroes who combat evil and save the world from destruction. Fantasy feeds a child's imagination and encourages creativity. The enjoyment that the genre engenders promotes reading and enhances literacy. Moreover, the fantasy genre may be used for teaching purposes. For example: A story about cruelty to animals would limit appeal to a child; however a fantasy celebration of closeness between the children and their pets may give an element of excitement as the children are able to save animals from someone with cruel intentions. Children love the Harry Potter series, and if they only see the movies they miss a great opportunity to develop their reading skills by spending time with the lovable young wizards and witches of the Hogwarts community. </s>"	High Fantasy </s>
Question: Dereck and Beverly usually sleep _ at night. Context: Dereck Joubert and his wife, Beverly, have made many films about wild animals in Africa. Their films and photographs are very popular and one of the photographs has been on the front cover of a National Geographic magazine. A working day for Dereck and Beverly started very early--at 4:30 in the morning! That's when they get up and start filming. And it's a long day--they often work until 8:30 in the evening. In the winter it's very cold and in the summer it can be 40C. Dereck always does the filming--Beverly never does that, and she doesn't write. But Dereck never takes photographs or records the sound. They work very well as a team, and they both believe we should shoot animals with cameras--not with guns! When they have finished filming and taking photographs for the day, they have dinner and Dereck usually writes while Beverly looks at her photographs. At night, they usually sleep in a small tent, but they sometimes sleep in the Land Cruiser--when they're very close to wild animals, it's sometimes safer to sleep in the car! Dereck and Beverly have also traveled around the world and given talks about their work. Dereck says that the animals are not just something to look at--they play an important role. Beverly thinks the wild animals can teach us a lot about ourselves. </s>	in a tent </s>

"Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Context: She almost did not run. Christine Williams admits that now. She could barely put one foot after another following the wake for her sister, who had died in an automobile accident. But she did run. With the cheers of friends and strangers reaching her heart, Williams set a C.W. Post record in Boston. Now she will run again, in the national Division II cross-country championships in Evansville, Ind. She wanted to be sure she was doing the right thing by running. She was the middle of three sisters, between Kerry, who is 25, and Jennifer, who was 18. Just going through any motions was hard enough, but Christine Williams wanted to know if she should put on her uniform and her shoes and run through the woods on an autumn afternoon, in the awful gaping time between her sister's wake and her funeral. ""I kind of got upset beforehand."" Williams admitted. Not a chatterbox under normal conditions, she now holds herself the best way she can, the fewer words the better. She almost walked away from the start line. But her friend Angela Toscano, who had flown up to Boston with her, directly from the wake, was standing near the line and talked her through it. ""She said my sister would have wanted me to run."" Christine said. And that was enough to get her started. The accident happened just after midnight on Nov, 4. Four young women were driving in an unfamiliar area of Long Island in Eastport, N.Y., when one of them apparently ran a yield sign, and the car was hit by another vehicle. Heather Brownrigg and Jennifer Williams died, and their friends April Brown and Kaci Moran were treated at a hospital and released. The crash made the papers. April Brown was charged with drunken driving and driving without a license. The wake began on Nov. 6. The next day Christine was to run with the Post cross-country team at the regional meet. Rich Degnan, the Post coach,""and Post officials offered a car service and tickets on the last flight-to Boston for Christine and Toscano. When they arrived at the hotel, the entire team was waiting up for her. Everybody knew about it at the regional meet. Degnan had to arrange for the flexibility of an alternate, just in case Christine could not go. Several times during the race, Christine felt she could not continue. But then she heard her friends and all those other people, those strangers from other colleges, calling her name. She thought about Jennifer. And she ran. She finished fourth in 22 minutes 58 seconds, breaking the Post record for the 6-kilometer distance by 15 seconds.

Question: At present it costs NASA about _ dollars to transport water up to an astronaut at the ISS a day. Context: If you knew a bottle of water had been recycled from urine , would you drink it? Astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) may soon do so. NASA said it would use a high-tech machine to recycle wastewater at the ISS. The machine will recycle everything from sweat , the water for washing hands, shower water, water used for brushing teeth, and even urine, to make drinking water. It will save NASA millions of dollars each year. At present, each ISS astronaut uses about 4.4 liters of water every day. It costs about $24 million a year to transport water up to ISS. NASA says that a liter of water costs about $11,000. The machine will be sent to the ISS in October 2008. NASA hopes it will recycle about 93% of all water used on the station. Will the water be clean? Scientists say the wastewater will go through a very complicated process .

Question: Which is the best title for the passage? Context: Goals can help you do, be and experience everything you want in life. Instead of just letting life happen to you, goals allow you to make your life happen. Successful and happy people have an idea of how their life should be and they set lots of goals to help them succeed. By setting goals you are taking control of your life. It's like having a map to show you where you want to go. Think of it this way. There are two drivers. One has a destination in mind which is laid out for her on a map. She can drive straight there without any wasted time or wrong turns. The other driver has no goal or destination or map. She starts off at the same time from the same place as the first driver, but she drives without an aim around, never getting anywhere, just using up gas and oil. Which driver do you want to be? Winners in life set goals and follow through on them. Winners decide what they want in life and then get there by making plans and setting goals. Unsuccessful people just let life happen by accident. Goals aren't difficult to set--and they aren't difficult to reach. It's up to you to find out what your goals and ideals really are. Research tells us that when we write a goal down, we are more likely to achieve. Written goals can be reviewed regularly,and have more power. Like a contract with yourself, they are harder to neglect or forget. Also when you write your goals in a particular way, you are able to make yourself be continuously alert to situations that will further your goals. </s>	Goals help you succeed </s>

"Question: The car the dogs drove was adjusted _ . Context: It is often said that you cannot ""teach an old dog new tricks"", but three New Zealand dogs have decided to prove otherwise by learning a skill --- driving a car! What's even more impressive is that the three who have become skilled in just eight weeks are not special dogs that belong to some rich owners, but abandoned ones at New Zealand's SPCA. To get their training started, 10-month old Porter, 18-month-old Monty and one-year-old Ginny were selected from a pool of seven potential candidates and moved to Animal Q, a talent agency that teaches animals tricks for movies and television shows. The driving classes began with teaching the dogs some basic driving techniques like turning the steering wheels and applying the brakes. After that the dogs practiced everything they had learnt behind the wheels of a motorized car. Then finally, it was time for the big test--- driving a real car! Human cars are not really built for four-legged animals, so the car they drove was adjusted so that the dogs could sit comfortably and easily reach the steering wheel with their paws. Though they all seemed to do very well, the real test came on Monday night when Monty, the best driver of the three, showed his great driving skill on live television. Why would the SPCA go through so much trouble to highlight the skills of homeless dogs? The reason is to show that adopting a dog from a shelter does not mean owners are getting a pet that is worse than one purchased from a keeper. The CEO of the SPCA is hoping that this unusual event will be enough to convince the residents of New Zealand to consider them, when searching for a pet. We surely hope so, meanwhile we are almost certain that these three pioneers have at least landed their names in the Guinness World Records, creating a category that probably does not even exist today! </s>"	to ensure the dogs could sit comfortably and drive easily </s>

"Question: What's the advantage of the interactive systems over the traditional ones? Context: Interactive Home-security Systems Tarik Celebi, who lives in San Francisco suburb, takes his home-security system with him to work, to dinner, just about anywhere.By his cell phone, he ""arms"" his home-security alarm from his car before he leaves for work.During his workday, he gets e-mail alerts every time his front door opens, even though he's miles away.If the door opens at an unusual time -say midday when no one should be coming or going - he can order a 30-second video clip from the camera that watches the door.If it's just his mother-in-law getting a package delivery, no worries. Celebi is one of the first users of the latest interactive home-security systems.In addition to sounding alarms when the house is broken into and notifying homeowners or police, as traditional systems do, the interactive systems give users new ways to remotely control their systems and their home environment.Different from traditional home-security alarms, which homeowners typically have to press buttons on a keypad to turn on before they leave their homes, the interactive systems enable consumers to arm and disarm systems from smart phones, iPads and PCs, no matter where they are. Most traditional systems are set up to sound an alarm if doors or windows are opened. The interactive systems give homeowners more options.For example, users can elect when they want to be notified.They might want an e-mail or a text every time a door is opened, or only during the hours of 3 to 4 p.m., when kids come home from school.Like Celebi, they can add cameras and get video clips when doors open.That could be helpful in making sure kids aren't bringing friends home when they're not supposed to. Nationwide, about 20% of homes have.traditional home-security systems.About half stop using them because they tire of the trouble.Being able to arm systems even while dashing to the subway or while at work will increase their usage of the new interactive systems.Although the new functions add costs to home security, the interactive-systems are believed to push home-security systems' usage rates closer to 30%, which would be a big movement for an industry that's been largely stuck at 20% for the past decade.""We all know it's going to get bigger, though we don't know how long it's going to take,"" Eric Taylor, an officer from San Francisco Security Department says. </s>"	They have more ways to inform the users. </s>

Question: In the writer's view,the more new goods, . Context: People all over the world today are beginning to hear and learn more and more about the problem of pollution.Pollution is caused either by man's release of completely new artificial substances into the environment,or by releasing greatly increased amounts of a natural substance,such as oil from oil tankers into the sea. The whole industrial process which makes many of the goods and machines we need and use in our daily lives,is bound to create a number of waste products which upset the environmental balance,or the ecological balance as is also known.Many of these waste products can be prevented or disposed of.But while more and more new and complex goods are produced,there will be new,dangerous waste to be disposed of,for example,the waste products from nuclear power stations.Many people,therefore,see pollution as only part of a larger and more complex problem,that is,the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods.Others again see the problem mainly in connection with agriculture,where new methods are helping farmers grow more and more on their land to feed our ever-increasing population.However,the land itself is gradually becoming worn out as it is being used,in some cases,too heavily,and artificial fertilizers can not restore the balance. Whatever its underlying reasons are,there is no doubt that much of the pollution caused could be controlled if only companies,individuals and governments would make more efforts.In the home there is an obvious need to control litter and waste.Food comes wrapped up three or four times in packages that all have to be disposed of;drinks are increasingly sold in bottles or tins which can not be reused.This not only causes a litter problem,but also is a great waste of resources,in terms of glass,metals and paper.Advertising has helped this process by persuading many of us not only to buy things we neither want nor need,but also to throw away much of what we do buy.Pollution and waste combine to be a problem everyone can help to solve by cutting out unnecessary buying,excessive consumption and careless disposal of the products we use in our daily lives. </s>	the more pollution there will be </s>
Question: We may infer from the passage that _ . Context: Duke Ellington is known as one of the most important composers of his time, and his work has been enjoyed for more than 80 years by music lovers all over the world. During his lifetime Ellington turned musical sounds into many compositions, mostly in the style known as jazz. The Early Years Edward Kennedy Ellington was born in 1899 in Washington, D. C. It wasn't until Ellington was a teenager that his interest in music grew. He taught himself to play the piano by listening to local piano players. Sometime around 1916 Ellington began playing the piano at high school parties. Ellington realized that he enjoyed entertaining people with his music. He soon became a very popular musician, playing at parties and other events in the Washington area. Young adults seemed especially delighted by the modern pieces he composed. Success in New York In 1923, when Ellington was almost 24 years old, he joined The Washingtonians, a five-piece group of musicians in Washington, and became the group's leader in early 1924. In 1927 Ellington and his orchestra won an engagement at Harlem's famous Cotton Club. For the next three years, his orchestra played at the Cotton Club nearly every night. The Influence of the Cotton Club Working at the Cotton Club encouraged Ellington's creativity. Since the shows changed every six months, he was challenged by the need to continually develop new material. He had to compose a wide variety of music to accompany the various acts in the Cotton Club shows and to adapt that music to the strengths and weaknesses of the players in his orchestra. By 1928 the popular nightspot began radio broadcasts. From the broadcasts Ellington and his orchestra gained a national reputation. On the Road As Ellington's popularity increased, he realized that his orchestra could do well on concert tours. They left the Cotton Club in 1931 and toured America and Europe almost continually for the next 43 years. In addition to touring, Ellington made recordings and continued to compose music. Duke Ellington played the piano, composed music, and led his famous orchestra for more than 50 years, until his death in 1974. Music lovers all over the world agree that the large quantity of music he created will be enjoyed for many years to come. </s>	Ellington had a great effect on the world of music </s>
"Question: How many Chinese relics are there in the British Museum? Context: Have you ever wanted to travel back through time and see what life was like at the beginning of man? Well, museums can make history come alive. And one museum in particular can take you on an exciting journey from the beginning of human culture to the present day. It is the British Museum. Being one of the largest museums in the world, it is home to over 7 million objects from all the world's continents. While most of us may not have the chance to visit London, we can catch a glance of the treasures it holds in Beijing. From December 10 to Februry 10, more than 100 cultural relics will be on show in the Palace Museum. Named ""Britain and the World"", a range of pencil sketches, watercolor paintings, sculptures and many other objects have traveled to China. There are several Chinese objects on show. But ""the British Museum got them before 1830 mainly by trade,"" said Ma Jige, deputy director of the Exhibition Department of the Palace Museum.

"Question: What is the best title of the passage? Context: Global warming threatens to hold back human progress, and make unachievable all UN targets to reduce poverty, according to some of the world's leading international development groups. In a report published today, Oxfam, Greenpeace, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth, WWF and 15 other groups say rich governments must immediately address climate change to avoid even ""unbearable levels"" of worldwide poverty. ""Food production, water supplies, public health and people's living environment are already being damaged,"" the report says. ""The world must meet its promise to achieve poverty reduction and also deal with climate change."" The report, which draws on UN predictions of the effects of climate change in poor countries over the next 50 years, says poor countries will experience more flooding, declining food production, more disease and the worsening or disappearing of entire ecosystems on which many of the world's poorest people depend. ""Climate change needs to be addressed now. The poor will bear the burden of it. The frontline experience of many of us working in international development indicates that communities are having to fight against more extreme weather conditions."" Climate change will play havoc with agriculture and water supplies and will increase diseases. ""By 2025 the proportion of the world's population living in countries of great water stress will almost double, to 6 billion people. Tropical and sub-tropical areas will be hardest hit -- those countries already suffering from food shortage"". Poor countries mostly do not need high-tech solutions, but would most benefit from education, research and being shown how to farm better.

"Question: What were volunteers asked to do? Context: Napping after learning something new could help improve your memory...as long as you dream, scientists say. They found people who dream about a new task do it better on waking than those who do not sleep or do not dream. Volunteers were asked to learn the layout of a 3D computer maze so they could find their way several hours later. Those allowed to take a nap and who also remembered dreaming of the task, found their way to a landmark quicker. The researchers think the dreams are a sign that unconscious parts of the brain are working hard to process information about the task. Dr. Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School, said dreams may be a marker that the brain is working on the same problem at many levels. Study tips Co-author Dr. Erin Wamsley said the study suggests our non-conscious brain works on the things that it deem are the most important. ""Every day we are gathering lots of information and new experiences,"" she said. ""It would seem that our dreams are asking the question, ""How do I use this information to inform my life?"" The scientists say there may be ways to use this phenomenon for improving learning and memory. For example, students might be better studying hard before bedtime, or taking a nap after a period of afternoon study. </s>"	Find their way out of a maze. </s>

I used to look through the phone book for hours trying to find Michael Jordan's phone number. When I couldn't find it, I just dialed seven numbers. When someone answered, I'd ask, ""Is that Michael Jordan?"" Obviously, I always had the wrong number. A year later I started playing basketball at my local recreation center. It was very big. I never thought in my wildest dreams that a basketball court could be inside a building. The recreation center had a special smell in it, sort of like hot rubber. I guessed it was from the shoes hitting the floor so fast and hard. The atmosphere on the court was carefree. Our biggest excitement of the day was when we actually made a shot. We celebrated wins over ice cream at a fast food restaurant. I got good at it, and my confidence grew. I played it all the time until the sixth grade. As soon as junior high school came, I stopped playing basketball and focused on school. When senior high school started, I tried out for the school team and made it. We worked hard. Every week we did 300 push-ups and 300 sit-ups on our own. Our coach encouraged the sit-ups to keep stomach power, because it gave us so much control when we were playing basketball. If we didn't want to do the sit-ups and push-ups, we could practice dribbling and shooting more. It's just us, the ball, the court and the net. But don't take my word for it. See for yourself.

"Question: What does the author think of kids' referring to parents' friends by their first names? Context: There is a big question making the rounds among the parents at my daughter's class. Should the kids refer to the parents' friends as ""Mr. Jones"" or ""Mrs. Smith"", rather than using their first names? I was quite shocked, having come from a home where it would have been unheard of to refer to one of my parents' friends by their first names. This was reserved for only the closest of family friends and s, and even they always had ""Aunt"" or ""Uncle"" in front their name. Respect is something that is earned. Unlike many of the other virtues we try to nurture in our kids, respect is a bit more complicated. It is not only necessary when dealing well with others, but the virtue of self-respect is critical for kids to succeed and feel good about themselves and their choices throughout their lives. There are several factors that can have a big impact on kids and their ability to be respectful. The first one to consider is manners. Calling adults by their surnames, setting proper examples during sporting events and while driving, and how we talk to each other in our homes all can have an enormous effect on a child's concept of respect and how important it is. Many of these seemingly trivial ideas have become almost outdated, but one should seriously consider the value of these ideas before casting( ) them aside. It is easy to become unaware of these behaviors. Try to keep track of how often your child is subjected to this kind of disrespect. The media, as you may have guessed, plays a large part in the increase in disrespect. Movies are equally to blame, with a PG movie often containing an abundant amount of _ language. These factors and others all contribute to an alarming increase in disrespect in society.

Question: Which of the following shows the process of hair growth? Context: Hair has always been an important sign of beauty. This is especially true for women. Next to the face, hair is one of the main qualities people look for when they consider a woman's beauty. Whether long or short, curly or straight, hair often gets a lot of attention. Each hair on a person's head grows from a single tube-like hole in the skin called a follicle. People are born with all of the hair follicles they are ever going to have. The average person has about one hundred thousand hair follicles. _ begin to form around the third month of pregnancy. Each hair grows independently of other hairs. There are three periods of hair growth. Not all hairs experience the same period of growth at the same time. The period of active growth is called Anagen. During this period, hair grows at a rate of about three tenths millimeters a day, or one centimeter a month. About 85 percent of hair follicles are going through this process at any given time. This period can last from two to six years. The Catagen period of hair growth comes next. It is then that hair growth begins to slow down. This period usually lasts two or three weeks. Finally, hair growth comes to a complete stop and the hairs begin to fall out. This period is known as Telogen. It affects about 15 percent of all hairs at a time. On average, a person loses between 50 and 100 hairs every day. Since each hair grows at a different rate, this process is overlooked. Once the Telogen period has ended, the hair growth process begins again. </s>	Anagen / \ Telogen - Catagen </s>
"Question: Where can this passage be found? Context: The Beijing Hutong (old lane) areas have a very special and important position in the rich history and culture of Beijing. While visiting the Beijing Hutong, you can appreciate the dramatic changes that the rest of Beijing has undergone. You can see evidence of the history of Beijing, experience the old way of life and experience traditional Beijing culture. The Beijing Hutong is made up of lanes or alleys formed by lines of pre-modern quadrangles (siheyuan), four-sided dwelling compounds or quadrangles consist of one-story courtyard houses, which make up old Beijing, and feature typical Chinese residential architecture. Beijing road classification was once s follow: A 36-foot-wide road was called a standard, street, an 18-foot-wide one was a small street and a 9-foot-wide lane was named a hutong. In fact, the Beijing Hutongs are unclassifiable by the traditional standard, ranging from 40 centimeters to 10 feet in width. The longest hutong has more than 20 turns. It is easy to get lost in the maze of winding lanes hat is the hutong, with the gray-tiled houses and deep alleys crossing each other, all identical in appearance, with many blind hutongs or culdesacs. Hutongs were first named as such in the Yuan Dynasty(1271-1368), with its Mongolian rulers having an influence on the Chinese language. However, siheyuan or quadrangles have probably been around much longer. The name of a hutong represents its origin, location or history. It is in the gray-tiled deep lanes that families play, travel, buy goods, gossip and connect. In beijingers'eyes, hutong means a period of history, a cordial lifestyle and even an ""encyclopedia of Beijing"". When urban construction threatens the existence of these hutongs, Beijingers become worried. Beijing still has about 400 000 residential quadrangles now, mainly distribute over the East, West, Xuanwu and Chongwen districts. The municipal government has marked a number of these compounds for protection. If you would like to have a glimpse into Beijing' Yesterday, you are highly recommended to have a short adventure trip to the Hutongs.

"Question: It is implied in the passage that _ . Context: Workplaces all over the UK are preparing for Christmas and all the traditions and customs that come with it. But will Christmas be a cause for happiness and celebration or embarrassment and disappointment? One way that colleagues in Britain show their appreciation of each other at this time of year is by doing ""Secret Santa"" present giving. At that time, people who work together buy each other gifts without saying whom they are from. Co-workers all write their names on a piece of paper and then organize a lottery in which each workmate takes another colleague's name at random . Each person then has to buy a present for the colleague whose name they have picked, usually with an agreed price set at a small amount of money such as five or ten pounds. As the gifts are given without knowing the names of the gift givers, the quality of the presents can be very different; gifts that people received are from tickets to the opera to an air-freshener for a car. Another common seasonal workplace tradition is the office Christmas party, when workmates put on their most attractive clothes and enjoy lots of free wine. Although most parties are held _ , sometimes the effects of alcohol cause party goers to regret their drunken antics . The BBC invited people to share their most embarrassing Christmas office party stories, and received hundreds of funny stories, such as the man who split his trousers back to front with his strange dance moves or the drunken lady who spent the entire night with back of her dress tucked into her pants and saw the photos that proved it later at work.

Question: What does the author mainly discuss in the text? Context: Today, many people use plants from other places to design their yards. Well, do they have any influence on animals living nearby? As we know, plants supply food for things like insects and plant-eating animals. In turn, birds and meat-eating animals feed on these insects and plant-eating animals. It is easy to see how important plants are. Although foreign plants may look beautiful, they can cause problems when there are too many of them. I live in Virginia, USA, and sometimes see a plant--commonly known as Kudzu--that seems to cover everything in the area, even climbing over whole trees and houses. Kudzu is an unbelievable plant since it grows very fast. It was first brought to the United States from south-east Asia around the 1870's as a crop that farmers could grow. However, Kudzu quickly came to be considered harmful throughout the southern United States. Since Kudzu grows fast in many different environments, it can completely cover areas of land quickly. The plant is also not eaten by any insects or birds in the United States so it can grow unchecked. Kudzu can cover trees, bushes, and even houses. It costs the United States 500 million dollars a year to just keep Kudzu from growing too fast. The plant is a perfect example of what scientists call an invasive species, which grows more quickly than other native plants. All foreign plants have the possibility to spread quickly. Not only are they costly, but planting them in gardens actually takes away food from insects. If everyone filled their garden with plants native to where they live, many lovely butterflies and other native creatures would be attracted to their backyards! So, take a look out of your window -- how does your garden grow? </s>	It is important to say no to foreign plants. </s>

"Question: Which of the following would be the best title for the text? Context: Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving. At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. ""He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,"" he told me. ""As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive."" I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. ""I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed."" he told me.

"Question: Who are the intended readers of the passage? Context: For pet owners, the hundreds of pet food recalls taking place each year has raised a lot of alarm. ""Most people are caring pet owners, and they want to do what helps protect their pet,"" explains Will Post, founder and CEO, Hound & Gatos Pet Foods Corporation. ""Yet the problem is that most are not sure what that means and how to go about it. The more they learn about pet food, the better able they will be to make an informed decision that will keep their pet healthier and safer."" Here are several tips that consumers may want to keep in mind when it comes to choosing a pet food that will help reduce the risks. Get to know the company. Most people may know a company name simply because they spend millions on advertising. But that doesn't mean they know much about the company or their morals. Research companies to find one that offers high standards, quality products, and great customer service. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to get in touch with a pet food company and ask them where something was made, where ingredients came from, or any other questions. They should have no problem answering questions about their products, or with being able to provide proof of their quality standards. Read reviews. Do some searches to read some reviews about various brands of pet food. Keep in mind that some reviews can be one-sided and even planted by the company itself, so look for fair third-party sources giving the review. Investigate ingredients. The source of ingredients is of major concern when it comes to reducing the risks of pet food recalls and keeping pets healthy. Read the labels and ask questions to determine where the ingredients are coming from. Understand pet foods. Cat and dog food should contain 100 percent protein, which will supply them with the nutrients their bodies require. The problem with many commercial pet foods is that it is full of numerous fillers, such as cheap fillers and grains. </s>"	Pet owners. </s>
Question: According to the passage?not many girls grow to enter STEM fields because _ . Context: The early lack of exposure to science ,technology,engineering and mathematics (STEM) can be harmful to achieving gender balance in these fields. It begins when we are young and continues throughout our time in high school. While at home,girls generally don't get to experience the level of exposure or encouragement in STEM fields that their male counterparts do. It is often subtle ,but it's the first hurdle that faces and confuses so many women. Boys ,on the other hand, get on their path ,and are encouraged to do so, generally earlier than girls. For example ,boys are more often given science sets as toys ,which spark an interest in these subjects. In school3boys are often pushed to take the more challenging math and science classes. So if we want to attract the best and brightest minds into the fields that will advance us as a people?a country,and a planet,we can no longer look to only half of the population. Young girls cannot possibly consider opportunities they do not know exist. If girls are not exposed to certain subject and career paths,they are highly unlikely to choose to follow them in college. Our bias toward girls9either from families or from schools ,is so rooted in our culture that we often don't even recognize _ . Although the situation Has changed greatly in the past 20 or 30 years,there is still a sense that girls aren't as good at math9for instance9even though there is almost no evidence to support such a belief. It is important that as a society we deal with gender stereotypes long before young people are faced with a decision to declare or choose a major in college. Without making efforts to break them, we are limiting the potentials of our youth,both male and female. Providing the necessary resources, exposure,and encouragement would help young women understand that their gender shouldn't determine the career path they choose, and that pursuing a STEM career does not make them less feminine. </s>	girls get fewer chances to know about STEM </s>
Question: If one of your baby teeth falls out, you_. Context: Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. </s>	will gain a permanent tooth in future </s>
Question: From the last two sentences we can see that 1981 government's poverty line _ . Context: Most Americans get what money they have from their work; that is, they earn an income from wages or salaries. The richest Americans, however, get most of their money from what they own -- their stocks, bonds, real estate, and other forms of property, or wealth. Although there are few accurate statistics to go by, wealth in American society appears to be concentrated in very few hands. More than 20 percent of everything that can be privately owned is held by less than one percent of the adult population and more than 75 percent of all wealth is owned by 20 percent of American adults. The plain fact is that most Americans have no wealth at all aside from their homes, automobiles, and a small amount of savings. Income in the United States is not as highly concentrated as wealth. In 1917 the richest 10 percent of American families received 26.1 percent of all income, while the poorest 10 percent received 17 percent, mainly from Social Security and other government payments. The most striking aspect of income distribution is that it has not changed significantly since the end of World War II. Although economic growth has roughly doubled real disposable family income (the money left after taxes and adjusted for inflation) over the last generation, the size of the shares given to the rich and the poor is about the same. By any measure economic inequality is great in the United States. The reality behind these statistics is that a large number of Americans are poor. In 1918, 14 percent of the population was living below the federal government's poverty line, which at that time was an annual income of $ 9 287 for a nonfarm family of two adults and two children. In other words, about one out of seven Americans over 31 million people was officially considered unable to buy the basic necessities of food, clothes, and shelter. The suggested poverty line in 1981 would have been an income of about $11, 200 for a family of four. By this relative definition, about 20 percent of the population or more than 45 million Americans are poor. </s>	was not put into operation then </s>
Question: If Lisa tells you about her idea, but you think her idea is foolish, you should _ . Context: Working on a team is a good thing. But it can bring you some troubles. If people on your team are not good at communicating, you may often feel terrible. To create a successful team, good communication is the most necessary part for both team members and the leader.

"Question: What makes the climate computer game different from the other games? Context: Ever wondered how one person could save the planet from the effects of climate change? A British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that. ""Fate of the World""puts the Earth's future in players' hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions or let it destroyed by more emissions. Through different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years. An improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year. Created by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists. ""Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,"" Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption's founder and chairman said. This year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public's interest in climate change. However, games centered on sustainability and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness. Using climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing.Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.""We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,""he added. </s>"	It uses data from real climate models and advice from experts. </s>
Question: If someone betrays you and hurts you, you should _ . Context: Sometimes people come into your life and they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be-----a roommate, a neighbor, a professor, a friend, a lover or even a complete stranger------but when you lock eyes with them, you know at the very moment they will affect your life in some profound way. Sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection , you find that without overcoming those obstacles , you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart. Every thing happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good or bad luck. Illness, injury, lost moments of true greatness, and pure stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved straight flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you want to become. Even the bad experience can be learned from. In fact, they are sometimes the most important ones. If someone loves you, give love back to them in whatever way you can, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart. _ . Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and listen to what they say. Let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you. </s>	forgive them and learn from the lesson </s>
"Question: From the passage we can know _ . Context: TOKYO--Lonely astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) may soon be getting a robot friend from Japan. Japan's space agency is considering putting a talking humanoid robot on the ISS to watch the work while astronauts are asleep, monitor their health and stress levels and communicate to Earth through the microblogging site Twitter. Japan's space agency JAXA announced this week that it is looking at a plan to send a humanoid robot to the space station in 2013 that could communicate with the ground through Twitter--primarily feeding photos, rather than original ideas --and provide astronauts with ""comfort and companionship"". Following up on US NASA's ""Robonaut"" R2 program, which is set for launch on the Discovery shuttle next week, the Japanese robot would be part of a larger effort to create and refine robots that can be used by the elderly, JAXA said in a statement. Japan is one of the leading countries in robotics and has a rapidly aging society with one of the world's longest life expectancies. Improving robot communication capabilities could help elderly people on Earth by providing a nonintrusive means of monitoring the robot owner's health and vital signs and sending information to emergency responders if there is an abnormality, JAXA said. ""We are thinking in terms of a very humanlike robot that would have facial expressions and be able to talk with the astronauts,"" said JAXA's Satoshi Sano. The robot was being developed with the advertising and communications giant Dentsu Inc and a team at Tokyo University. The NASA project has a humanlike head, hands and arms and uses the same tools as station crew members. The ""Robonaut"" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station's Destiny lab. NASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans. For now, the $2.5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab. </s>"	future astronauts will become less lonely and more comfortable with the help of the robot </s>

"Question: How should we save energy according to the author? Context: If you haven't already, you too should switch to the latest eco-friendly, energy-efficient, energy-saving LED (Light Emitting Diode) lighting. As the world becomes more focused on green issues, everyone should do their part in practicing energy efficiency, recycling, cutting down their CO2emissions and much, much more. One of the most successful campaigns that started in Australia is the now world-famous""Earth Hour"". 2.2 million of Sydney's residents turned off their lights for an hour in a mass attempt to save energy. The following year, the same idea was adopted by a whole host of different cities. This is a great example of a campaign to promote eco-friendly options and energy efficiency. But while it clearly raises awareness, it is not a long-term solution to energy saving across the developed world. A long-term solution can be found in the form of switching to LED lighting rather than the traditional halogen lights found in a typical home. Put simply, LED lighting is the future of lighting. LED lamps use up only a fraction of the energy compared to that of regular lamps. They also produce a quality flicker-free light, and will last longer than a regular light with 50,000 hours being realistic. Not only are they longer lasting and more energy-efficient with no sacrifice in light quality, but they may quickly become a possible substitute for regular lamps that have been previously installed by homes and businesses. An ordinary 50 watt low-voltage halogen light on for 4 hours a day would cost $ 25 per year to run. With a life span of around 3,000 hours it will typically stop working at the two-year mark. Compared with the regular one, an LED light of 50 watts operating for the same period will cost roughly $ 6 per year to run and last 50,000 hours. That means it won't have to be replaced for 24 years! It really is a _ to switch to energy-saving LED lighting. Plus, you will be doing your bit for the environment by becoming more eco-friendly. </s>"	Use LED lights. </s>

"Question: Why are the desks of all kinds designed for those who sit more? Context: The human body is designed to move. But modern lifestyles and office jobs rarely give us the chance to move around. As we know. we're while we're eating; we sit in the car and we sit while we watch TV. And many of us sit for many hours at work. New research shows that sitting less than three hours a day might extend your life by two years. Peter Katzmarzyk,a scientist at the University of Louisiana in the southern United States,says that sitting is ubiquitous in our lives,meaning it is something we do all the time,everywhere. However,Mr. Katzmarzyk says that does not mean you can sit for the rest of your waking hours. He also says you may exercise often,""We can't throw away physical activity. It's extremely important. We have 60 years of research showing us that. "" Mr. Katzmarzyk and his coi leagues are part of a new generation of researchers studying how sitting all day affects length of life. ""Studies that have assessed the relationship between sitting and mortality or television viewing and mortality are very rare. There's only been a few of them,actually five or six now,in the last four or five years. ""They found that cutting television time to less than two hours a day could add one-point four years to life. Luckily,change is already coming to some offices,especially in the design of desks. A ""standing desk""lets people stand while they work. Another new design is called the ""treadmill desk. "" A treadmill is an exercise machine that lets you walk in one place. Even some U. S. schools are beginning to experiment with desks that are part bicycle to keep children moving.

"Question: Many Americans were denied the right to vote simply because _ . Context: The right to vote is one of the most fundamental rights of any democracy. Yet, for too long, too many of our fellow citizens were denied that right simply because of the color of their skin. Fifty years ago this week, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law to change that. The Voting Rights Act broke down legal barriers that stood between millions of African Americans and their constitutional right to cast ballot . It was, and still is, one of the greatest victories in our country's struggle for civil rights. But it didn't happen overnight. Countless men and women marched and organized, sat in and stood up, for our most basic rights. For this, they were called agitators and un-American; they were jailed and beaten. Some were even killed. But in the end, they reaffirmed the idea at the very heart of America: that people who love this country can change it. Our country is a better place because of all those heroes did for us. But as one of those heroes, Congressman John Lewis, reminded us in Selma this past March, ""There's still work to be done."" Fifty years after the Voting Rights Act, there are still too many barriers to vote, and too many people trying to erect new ones. We've seen laws that roll back early voting, force people to jump through hoops to cast a ballot or lead to legitimate voters being improperly purged from the rolls. Over the years, we have seen provisions specifically designed to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote. In a democracy like ours, with a history like ours, that's a disgrace. That's why, as we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, I'm calling on Congress to pass new legislation to make sure every American has equal access to the polls. It's why I support the organizers getting folks registered in their communities. And it's why, no matter what party you support, my message to every American is simple: get out there and vote--not just every four years, but every chance you get, because your elected officials will only heed your voice if you make your voice heard. The promise that all of us are created equal is written into our founding documents but it's up to us to make that promise real. Together, let's do what Americans have always done: Let's keep marching forward, keep perfecting our union, and keep building a better country for our kids.

"Question: According to this passage, which of the following can be considered as the behavior of a hero? Context: Once many years ago, I pulled a family out of a burning car somewhere in Wyoming. Last week I received a telephone call from a woman who could not stop crying as she told me that one of my stories had saved her son from committing suicide. In closing she called me a hero. That got me thinking about what a hero is. Was I a hero because I pulled a family from a burning car? If so, how could I be a hero just because I wrote a story that saved someone's life? Today I decided to look up the word ""hero"" in the dictionary to see exactly what it meant. It read ""a person who does. something brave"". As I read on, it also said ""a person who is good and noble "". That statement impressed me more than the part about being brave. So I thought about something very important. Say I was walking into the local Wal-Mart Store and I happened to open, and hold the door for someone as a _ . As they passed me by, I say, ""How are you today?"" Most of the time that would be no big deal, but this time let's say it was for someone who was deeply depressed and near the end of the rope.

Having been near ""the end of my rope"", after my marriage of twenty years ended, I was in such a condition. I was within hours trying to get enough courage to end the pain and misery. When I returned home, someone had sent me a card in the mail which told me how much they would appreciate me as a friend. That wonderful card probably saved my life. That person, without even knowing it, saved a life and became a hero.

Question: Which statement is NOT true according to the passage? Context: Pottery is the name given to all kinds of useful or artistic objects made from clay. Pottery can be plates or water pots or baskets. Pottery can be large or small, fancy or plain. Pottery is part of the large family of ceramics .Ceramics are synthetic materials. For example, bricks and tiles are both ceramics. How is pottery made? First, a potter takes some clay. Clay is a soft, red material from the earth. It looks a little like red dirt, but it's very different. Clay is thick and rich. Wet clay can be worked into any shape. When the clay dries, it will keep that shape. The potters takes some clay and pushes and squeezes it until it is soft and smooth. After that, the clay can be shaped into anything. There are several ways to shape clay. Sometimes potters use their hands. Sometimes they use a special wheel. They place the clay in the center of a round, flat wheel. The wheel moves very fast, and the potter shapes the clay. After the potter has shaped the clay, it can be decorated . Potters use glaze, which is a kind of paint, to decorate their work. Some glazes are very simple. Other glazes have beautiful colors and designs. The glaze is not just beautiful. It is also useful. The glaze makes the pottery smooth and waterproof. Potters also make some decorative lines and designs on the surface. After it is decorated, the clay must be baked, or fired, in a special oven. Baking the clay at very high temperature makes it hard and strong. Firing also makes the glaze stick to the pottery. When the firing is over, the potter carefully removes the pottery from the oven and lets it cool slowly. If it cools too quickly, it could crack and break. Since pottery is waterproof, it is very popular for dishes. You can find examples of pottery in almost any home. But pottery can also be found in museums. Some pieces of pottery are valuable and beautiful pieces of art. </s>	After the firing in high temperature, pottery is easy to break. </s>

He said to his friend Robert, ""I hate the hot weather here, but I can't think of a cool place in Australia. Where shall I take my holiday?"" ""That's easy,"" said Robert, ""You can go to Moscow. Snow and ice are covering the ground there now."" Mr Evans agreed with his friend. He bought a plane ticket and soon arrived in Moscow. He was having a good time there, but one day he got into trouble . After lunch, he went to a park outside the city. He noticed a dog following him when he was walking past a house. It was hungry and wanted some food to eat. But Mr Evans had no food in his pockets. He tried to shoo it away, but it began to bark at him. Just at that moment, he saw a stone on the ground. He tried to pick it up, but he couldn't. ""How strange these Russians are!"" Mr Evans said to himself, ""They do not tie up their dogs, but firmly tie down the stones!"" </s>"	it was too cold </s>
"Question: What can we infer about the restaurant? Context: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. ""How did you find out about us?""our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled""Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal"". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter. </s>"	The business is not promising. </s>

"Question: The passage suggests that elephants _ . Context: When it comes to social behaviour,mammals are in a league of their own.Some birds may form pairs,or even cooperate to hunt,but the complexity of their relationships can hardly compare to those within a school of dolphins,a herd of elephants or a group of humans.What makes mammalian social groups different from a flock of starlings or a shoal of fish,is that in many cases the individuals could recognize each other.Although we may think that all elephants look pretty much the same,we can easily tell individuals of our own species apart and it has become clear through studies that the same is true of other species.Dolphins have their own signature whistles that act like ""names"",and elephants can recognize and greet other individuals they have known but not seen for many years.This is something that only a few species of birds appear to be able to do. Mammals in complex social groups not only recognize each other as individuals,but also they remember a lot of information about that individual.Social groups often rely on this memory--such as knowing who is dominant to whom,who is related to whom,and who has done what to whom in the past.It's like remembering who you have lent money to or done a favour for,and who hasn't repaid that money or has talked about you behind your back.You have to learn who to trust,who your friends are,and who to watch out for. All this remembering goes on in a particular part of the brain called the neocortex .If you compare the size of a mammal's social group with the size of this part of the brain,you will find they are remarkably closely related.This area seems to take a long time to develop fully and animals in which it is very large take a very long time to grow up to adulthood.During this time,the youngster has to learn all the rules of social behaviour in their group and to piece together all the relationships between the group members:Knowledge that will be needed to avoid getting into trouble. </s>"	have good memories </s>
Question: When you realized that your patience is being examined, you should _ . Context: Learning how to be patient with people can be challenging for some. After all, not everybody is gifted with great patience. The good news is that it is something that can be learned and eventually perfected. When the customer before you takes ages to pay for his or her groceries, you tap your foot impatiently and cough every now and then; but no, the customer is still not hurrying up. It takes all of your power not to _ However, if you picture that customer to be someone you like (say your partner), then you will find yourself not getting too annoyed, right? So the next time you find yourself losing patience with somebody, simply visualize that person to be someone you really, really like and your patience will extend its life. The second step on how to be patient with people involves whistling. When you whistle a happy tune, you instantly cheer up. You can sing your favorite song if you can't whistle - it really doesn't make a difference. What's important here is that you have done something that makes you feel good. And when you feel good, you are more likely to be patient with the people around you. Next, when you're stressed, it's almost impossible to learn how to be patient with people. If you know you're going to be in a situation where your patience will be tested, meditate or get yourself a massage first. Don't dive into anything unless you've managed to clear yourself off negative emotions. Remember: the more stressed you are, the faster you'll lose your temper. The less stress you have in your life, the longer your patience. Learning how to patient with people is not a necessity in life. You've seen people who manage to survive day to day with incredibly bad tempers after all. But do you really want to live like they do? If, however, you want a life that has better quality than that, then just follow these steps and embrace the fact that patience is a virtue. </s>	learn to relax yourself in a possible way </s>

Question: We are told that in an average family about 1990 _ . Context: The greatest recent changes have been in the lives of women. During the twentieth century there was an unusual shortening of the time of a woman's life spent in caring for children. A woman marrying at the end of the 19th century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which custom, chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has the care of children ,her work is lightened by household appliances and convenience foods. This important change in women's way of life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls left school at the first opportunity and most of them took a full-time job. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school-leaving age is sixteen, many girls stay at school after that age , and though women tend to marry younger ,more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more after wads, return to full or part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with both husband and wife accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfaction of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money and running the home, according to the abilities and interest of each of them. </s>	four or five children died when they were five </s>

Question: What would the author most probably write about next ? Context: A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear . The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went .

Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen .

"Question: The writer argues in the passage that_. Context: The most exciting kind of education is also the most personal. Nothing can exceed the joy of discovering for yourself something that is important to you! It may be an idea or a bit of information you come across accidentally--or a sudden insight, fitting together pieces of information or working through a problem. Such personal encounters are the ""payoff"" in education. A teacher may direct you to learning and even encourage you in it--but no teacher can make the excitement or the joy happen. That's up to you. A research paper, assigned in a course and perhaps checked at various stages by an instructor, leads you beyond classrooms, beyond the texts for classes and into a process where the joy of discovery and learning can come to you many times. Preparing the research paper is an active and individual process, and ideal learning process. It provides a structure within which you can make exciting discoveries, of knowledge and of self, that are basic to education. But the research paper also gives you a chance to individualize a school assignment, to suit a piece of work to your own interests and abilities, to show others what you can do. Writing a research paper is more than just a classroom exercise. It is an experience in searching out, understanding and synthesizing , which forms the basis of many skills applicable to both academic and nonacademic tasks. It is, in the fullest sense, a discovering of an education. So, to produce a good research paper is both a useful and a thoroughly satisfying experience! To some, the thought of having to write an assigned number of pages, often more than ever produced before, is upsetting. To others, the very idea of having to work independently is threatening. But there is no need to approach paper assignment with anxiety, and nobody should view the research paper as an obstacle to overcome. Instead, consider it a goal to accomplish, a goal within reach if you use the help this book can give you. </s>"	one should consider research paper writing a pleasure, not a burden </s>

Question: _ gave the writer serf-esteem. Context: My father was a foreman of a sugar-cane plantation in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. My first job was to drive the oxen that ploughed the cane fields. I would walk behind an ox, guiding him with a broomstick. For $ 1 a day, I worked eight hours straight, with no food breaks. It was very _ work, but it prepared me for life and taught me many lasting lessons. Because the plantation owners were always watching us, I had to be on time every day and work as hard as I could. I've never been late for any job since. I also learned about being respectful and faithful to the people you work for. More important, I earned my pay; it never entered my mind to say I was sick just because I didn't want to work. I was only six years old, but I was doing a man's job. Our family needed every dollar we could make because my father never earned more than $ 18 a week. Our home was a three-room wood shack with a dirty floor and no toilet. Nothing made me prouder than bringing home money to help my mother, father, two brothers and three sisters. This gave me self-esteem , one of the most important things a person can have. When I was seven, I got work at a golf course near our house. My job was to stand down the fairway and spot the balls as they landed, so the golfers could find them. Losing a ball meant you were fired, so I never missed one. Some nights I would lie in bed and dreamt of making thousands of dollars by playing golf and being able to buy a bicycle. The more I dreamed, the more I thought. Why not? I made my first golf club out of guava limb and a piece of pipe. Then I hammered an empty tin can into the shape of a ball.

"Question: Which of the following might be the best title of the passage? Context: At the heart of the debate over illegal immigration lies one key question: are immigrants good or bad for the economy? The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad. Yet the agreement among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants' impact on the economy and the reality? There are a number of familiar theories. Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers. Others highlight the stress that undocumented immigrants place on public services, like schools, hospitals, and jails. Still others emphasize the role of race, arguing that foreigners add to the nation's fears and insecurities. There's some truth to all these explanations, but they aren't quite sufficient. To get a better understanding of what's going on, consider the way immigration's impact is felt. Though its overall effect may be positive, its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly. David Card, an economist at UC Berkeley, notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants' low-cost labor are businesses and employers --meatpacking plants in Nebraska, for instance, these producers' savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store, but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration, these, too, are concentrated. Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor. According to a study by George Borjas, a Harvard economist, immigration has reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9%. Among high-skilled, better-educated employees, however, opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services. What worried them most, in other words, was the financial burden of immigration. That conclusion was reinforced by another finding: that their opposition appeared to soften when that financial burden decreased, as occurred with welfare reform in the 1990s, which curbed immigrants' access to certain benefits. The irony is that for all the overexcited debate, the net effect of immigration is minimal. Even for those most acutely affected -- say, low-skilled workers, or California residents -- the impact isn't all that dramatic. ""The unpleasant voices have tended to dominate our perceptions,"" says Daniel Tichenor, a professor at the University of Oregon. ""But when all those factors are put together and the economists calculate the numbers, it ends up being a net positive, but a small one."" Too bad most people don't realize it. </s>"	A debate about the impact of illegal immigrants. </s>
Question: Volunteers don't want to get _ when they help others. Context: Volunteering means that you work to help people without being paid. There are many different volunteers.

Community Center ---a lot of community centers are very well run. However, some of them really need extra help, especially cleaning and repairs. As a student you can also do a lot of things to help others at school. Maybe you could start a support group. Here is some advice: Help students give up smoking, drinking or other bad habits.

"Question: When people are online, they talk by _ . Context: If you've been joining in chat room conversations, or trading e-mails with net pals , you have become one of the millions who write in a special, short form of English. Throughout the world, every night children and their elders are ""talking"" online-many of them are talking at the same time. It's fast: trying talking to six people once. It's convenient: three or four words per exchange. It takes cleverness, concentration and quick fingers. And it requires very simple language. There's neither time nor space for explanations. Why waste valuable time telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB (be right back) will do? Want to enter a conversation? Just type PMFJI (pardon me for jumping in). Interested in whom you're talking to? Type A/S/L, the nearly universal request to know your pal's age, sex and location. You may get 15/M/NY as a reply from your pal. If something makes you laugh, say you're OTF (on the floor), or LOL (laughing out loud), or join the two into ROTFL (rolling on the floor laughing). And when it's time to get back to work or go to bed, you type GTG (got to go) or TTYL (talk to you later). People want to write as fast as possible, and they want to get their ideas across as quickly as they can. Capital letters are left in the dust, except when expressing feeling, as it takes more time to hold down the ""Shift"" key and use capitals.

Question: According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by _ . Context: The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it. An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the America economic system. The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individual are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual. </s>	private property and rights concerned. </s>
"Question: How did the test subjects show the caffeine ' s memory-strengthening effects?

According to the US Food and Drug Administration, nearly 90 percent of people worldwide consume about 200 milligrams of caffeine each day. That' s equivalent to about one strong cup of coffee a day. Writing in "" Nature Neuroscience"" , Johns Hopkins University researchers say their findings show that caffeine strengthens certain memories for up t0 24 hours after being taken in. "" We've always known that caffeine has cognitive-enhancing effects , but its ,particular effects on strengthening memories and making them resistant to forgetting has never been examined in detail in humans, "" said senior author of the paper Michael Yassa. "" We re- port for the first time a specific effect of caffeine on reducing forgetting over 24 hours. "" Conducting a double-blind trial, the researchers worked with a test group of people who didn't regularly consume caffeinated products. Five minutes after studying a series of images, the test subjects were given either a placebo or a 200-milligram caffeine tablet. To check the caffeine levels of their test subjects, the research team took saliva samples from them before they took their tablets and again one, three and 24 hours after- wards. Both groups of test participants ( those who took the placebo and those who took the caffeine tablet) were tested the following day to see if they could recognize the images they' d seen the previous day. The test included showing the test subjects another series of images that included some new images , those that were shown the previous day, as well as other images that were similar, but not the same as those they had viewed earlier. The researchers found that more members of the group who were given the caffeine tablets were able to correctly identify some of the new images as "" similar"" to previously viewed images rather than incorrectly identifying them as the same.

Question: What's the purpose of this passage? Context: The parents of a troubled teen may feel unsure as to whom to turn to in order to find help for their child. They may feel as if they have exhausted all of their options, and sometimes they are on the verge of giving up. But there is hope. Schools for troubled teens offer discipline and in some cases, drug treatment programs that can provide important life skills, and more importantly, a fresh start. The following is a list of the most effective types of schools for troubled teens. Not every facility is a match for every child, but by knowing the differences between them, parents can make a better educated decision about where to send their teenager. Boarding Schools When a child is unable to deal with the relative freedom of a standard school day, boarding schools might be a good choice. At boarding schools, the child lives in a dorm setting, where almost every minute of the day is scheduled by school administrators. Treatment Centers When a teenager has an addiction to drugs or alcohol, a residential center that specializes in young people is an outstanding way to help them break the cycle of addiction. Treatment centers feature individual and group counseling to help identify the root causes of the drug problem and help develop the life skills needed to stay clean when the program is over. Wilderness Programs Designed to help improve the discipline and self-reliance of the child, wilderness programs send kids back to nature. By placing them in a foreign and sometimes uncomfortable setting, wilderness programs hope to improve children's behavior. Programs generally include hikes, exercise programs and team building exercises. Boot Camps Boot camps are the most extreme style of school for troubled teens. These facilities are modeled after actual military boot camps, where the individual must get into shape, work as part of a team, and follow a long, hard set of rules and regulations.

You are all alone - well, not quite. Just reach into your pocket and take out a piece of sugar.Put it into the battery, wait a minute, and you're back on the phone. Thanks to a couple of American scientists, this situation could become real.Swadesh Chaudhuri and Derek Lovely have invented the ""bacteria battery"" - powered by bacteria that eats sugar and turns it into electricity. ""This is a special organism,"" Lovely said.""You ean harvest enough electricity to power a cell phone battery for about four days from a spoonful of sugar."" In the past, bacteria batteries have been expensive and not long-lasting. But this battery uses more efficient bacteria that can turn 80 percent of sugar into electrical energy. This is 30 percent more than similar batteries can manage. The bacteria battery could become as small as a household battery. It's also cheap and stable, as sugar can be taken from waste and crops. But the sugar to electricity process is slow: it could take weeks for the bacteria to digest a cup of sugar.And it produces ""greenhouse"" gases which pollute the environment. The scientists understand there is a lot more work to be done. ""It is still young,"" said Lovely.""Where we are now is where solar power was 20 0r 30 years ago."" But he believes the battery could be used in scientific equipment at the bottom of the ocean.Other ideas include using sugar in the blood to run medical devices in the human body, and taking sugar from animal waste to provide energy to power homes in rural areas. </s>"	a scientific invention of a new kind of bacteria battery </s>

"Question: What can probably be regarded as ""female "" subjects by boys and girls? Context: Scientists have tried to come up with biological explanations for the difference between boys and girls. However, none were believable enough to explain the general picture. As one scientist points out, ""There are slight genetic differences between the sexes at birth which may affect the subjects boys and girls choose. But the difficulty is that by the time children reach school age, there are so many other effects that it is almost impossible to tell whether girls are worse at science and maths, or they've been brought up to think of these subjects as boys' 'territory' "". Statistics show that in mathematics, at least, girls are equal to boys. A recent report suggests that girls only stop studying mathematics because of social attitudes. One of the reports' authors says, ""While it is socially unacceptable for people not to be able to read and write, it is sill acceptable for women to say that they are 'hopeless' at maths. Our research shows that, although girls get marks which are as good as the boys' , they have not been encouraged to do so."" The explanation for the difference, which is very clear during the teenage years, goes as far back as early childhood experiences. From their first days in nursery school, girls are not encouraged to work on their own or to complete tasks, although boys are. For example, boys and not girls, are often asked to 'help' with repair work. This encouragement leads to a way of learning how to solve problems later on in life. A further report on maths teaching shows that teachers seem to give more attention to boys than to girls. Most teachers who took part in the study admitted that they expect their male students to do better at mathematics and science subjects than their females students. All of this tends to encourage boys to work harder in these subjects, gives them confidence and makes them believe that they can succeed. Interestingly, both boys and girls tend to regard such 'male' subjects like mathematics and science as difficult. Yet it has been suggested that girls avoid mathematics courses, not because they are difficult, but for social reasons. Mathematics and science are mainly male subjects, and therefore, as girls become teenagers, they are less likely to take them up. Girls do not seem to want to be in open competition with boys. Neither do they want to do better than boys because they are afraid to appear less female and less attractive. </s>"	English </s>

"Question: The purpose of the question at the beginning of this news report is to _ . Context: Question: What is more astonishing than a 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck being driven down the street? Answer: A 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck exploding and raining blubber ( fat of whales) all over the sidewalk. That's what happened in Taiwan recently, when a dead sperm whale being shipped to the Halobios Research Center for an autopsy developed an extremely bad case of gas and blew up before it reached its destination. The whale was found alive on a prefix = st1 /Taiwanbeach last weekend, and died shortly after it was discovered. Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose. Obviously, too much time passed between when the animal died and the time it was set to be moved to the autopsy location, because it had already started to go bad. When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly. The pressure inside the rotting creature grew so much that it popped like an over-filled balloon. Unfortunately, it was on a truck in the middle of the city of Taiwanat the time--- cars and shops lining the street were covered with whale bits and juices, much to their owners' discouragement. According to the news reports, traffic was tied up for hours while officials tried to clean up the streets.

""Color is a silent salesperson,"" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans. Kemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less. Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red. A spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company.

The scene was an air-raid shelter , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal . He had never been normal, ever since he was born.

"Question: What had happened to cougars before Paul began to study them? Context: As a young man, Paul Beier hiked in the mountains of California. Since then, he has decided to choose his career as a wildlife protector. He went to school to learn more first of all. After he earned his doctor's degree, he eagerly signed up for a job studying cougars , which once lived throughout the United States, but now live mainly in the Rocky Mountains and westward. They need not only a lot of land to survive but also plenty of food and places to raise their young. But many wild areas have been divided by freeways and taken over by towns. The small wilderness areas of the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California didn't have much room for them. And yet a few still lived there. How did they do it? Many big animals are disappearing. Those that survive are being trapped in shrinking patches of habitat. A patch may not have enough space or food for a cougar to survive. Scientists wondered if cougars could move from one patch to another. If so, maybe humans could preserve wildlife corridors to connect the patches, providing enough room for the animals. But no one had shown that animals use wildlife corridors in real life. To see if cougars had found corridors through local suburbs and freeways, Paul and his research team studied 32 cougars for five years. They used a drug to make each cat sleep, buckled a radio collar around its neck, and let it go. Every day, Paul used an electrical device that sends and receives radio signals to find cougars, listening for radio beeps from their collars. Once or twice a week, he trailed one of the cougars all night. He traced their travels on a map. Sure enough, some of them had discovered paths from one small park land to the next. One cougar became famous for his travels. He was named M6:""M""for Male, and""6""because he was the sixth one collared in the study. M6's corner of the Santa Ana Mountains wasn't large enough for him. Chino Hills State Park was not far away, but the trip was not safe. After dark, M6 used a paved vehicle underground passage to cross undera busy eight-lane freeway. He slipped by a riding stable, and then picked his way through a golf course and across two sets of busy railroad tracks. Finally, he arrived in the sheltered canyons of 12,000-acre Chino Hills State Park. There, the cougar found deer to hunt. During a year and a half, the scientists recorded M6 making this journey 22 times! Then Paul learned of plans to build houses, gas stations, and a mall that would block M6's path. Paul once said,""The loss of this corridor would guarantee the extinction of the cougar from the Chino Hills and endanger the entire population of lions in the Santa Ana Mountains.""A local citizens' group called Hills for Everyone raised money to buy the land and add it to the state park. When the group visited the state capital and showed the map that Paul had made of M6's journeys, the lawmakers saw how important the corridor was. The lawmakers had the passage preserved, with the pavement removed and with native bushes near the openings. While traffic roared above, M6 and other cougars could move safely between the state park and the mountains. Other animals such as deer, foxes, and bobcats could also use the corridor. Paul's research showed that wildlife corridors can save animals. Since his study in the Santa Ana Mountains, scientists around the world have begun restoring and protecting wildlife corridors. </s>"	Their habitats had been becoming smaller. </s>

Question: What is the focus of the last-5 -day campaigns for both presidential candidates? Context: Washington, November 1, 2012 (CNN) -- After years of planning and months of campaigning , the most expensive presidential race in history comes down to a final five-day whirlwind of speeches and television ads in the eight states still up for grabs. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney plan to hold virtually nonstop events between now and the Tuesday election considered too close to call. The focus is on battleground states worth 95 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Both sides are trying to close the deal with a decreasing number of uncommitted voters, while making sure supporters actually cast ballots. That means a game of campaign chess that started Thursday, with appearances by the candidates and their assistants as well as advertising dollars allocated to the places considered most vital to success. Concluding a race expected to cost more than $6 billion overall, Obama and Romney and their running mates will hit all the battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking.

"Question: The best title for this passage is _ . Context: On February 3rd, 1949, New York Harbor was an exciting place. Many people were there to greet a ship from France. On the ship were 49 French railroad boxcars filled with gifts from the people of France to the people of America. These boxcars were from the famous Merci Train(Merci:a French word meaning ""thank you""). After World War II, a lot of factories, roads and farms in France had been destroyed. Many French people had no jobs or money and had little to wear and little to eat. In the winter of 1947, a train was sent across the United States, stopping in cities and towns along the way. At every stop, people gave whatever they could. Factories gave clothing and medicine. Farmers gave food. Families gave money. Even school children gave away their pocket money. All the things were then taken to France by ship. By 1949,the French had begun to recover from the war. The Merci Train was their way of saying ""thank you"" to America. French people had filled the boxcars with gifts. Most of _ were personal, like hand-made toys, children's drawings, or postcards. But the boxcars themselves were perhaps the most meaningful of the gifts. On each car, the French people had painted the pictures of all their 40 provinces. with an American eagle on the front. The boxcars were taken to each state of America, where they were warmly greeted. Now many of the states still keep their boxcars. Gifts sent by the French people can still be seen in some museums. The Merci Train came out of the war, but it now reminds the world that countries can also work together in peace. </s>"	The Story Of The Merci Train </s>
"Question: How do dolphins exchange information with each other? Context: Dolphins are our friends. They can use tools to solve problems although they don't have hands. For example, scientists have ever found that a dolphin can make a shy eel come out of its hole with a dead fish. Dolphins use different sounds to exchange information with each other. Scientists in Hawaii have developed a sign language to give instructions to dolphins, and the results are amazing. They find that dolphins not only understand the meaning of individual words, but also understand the importance of word order in a sentence. Most animals enjoy playing -- but dolphins seem to like making their games as challenging as possible. On a beautiful day in 1997, scientists at a beach watched a little dog going into the sea and swimming towards the dolphins. To their surprise, the dolphins came up to the dog and then started throwing it into the air. The dog seemed to enjoy the ""game"" and continued playing with the dolphins for more than an hour. Dolphins live in a very different world from ours, but they are very good at our ""IQ tests"" . For example, they will jump out of the water when they hear a whistle noise. They do this because they will get a fish as a prize. There is still much to learn about these cute problem-solvers, but it is certain that watching a dolphin show is fun. ,.

Reading might be better than many activities if you want to educate yourself and improve your chances of succeeding in your work. If you're serious about creating the habit of reading,what's important is finding a time you can read every day--often that's early morning or late at night,or both. For others, it might be during their lunch break. You only need to read for 10 to 20 minutes a day to form the habit. Then, you need to find a place that's comfortable. Make sure it has good lighting, the temperature is nice and you're in a good chair. Or you can find some place that you can relax in without falling asleep, although there's nothing wrong with sleep. Next,be sure to shut off the TV,Internet,cell phone,radio, or other music. Let reading be a quiet time. Mark an ""x"" on your calendar every day you read, and try to keep your unbroken ""x""es going as long as possible. A habit is much easier to form if it's something you enjoy, not something you are made to do. So make the time, you spend reading a joy.

"Question: On Pluto's surface, liquid methane boils to form an atmospheric haze, which would be most similar to _ . Context: (This selection was originally published in 1992. Pluto is no longer classified as a planet.) Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon(called Charon). Its orbit is unusual, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze . When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane. Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow. The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet(he called it Planet X)based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these ""irregularities"" weren't real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be(although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations).In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell's last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We'll never know. </s>"	steam </s>
"Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements is not true? Context: Thai authorities have been urged to see to it that condominiums , apartment houses and other lodgings available to tourists throughout the country will be of higher quality than today, a leading tourism businesswoman has said. Piyaman Techapaibul, president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, called on the Ministry of Tourism & Sports as well as other government agencies concerned to have those places and accommodations for tourists improved and upgraded to meet international standards because, she said, today's tourists from around the world have more money to spend and prefer quality lodgings as well as quality services and accommodations at those places. ""Added by condos and apartment houses currently opening for daily rent, the number of lodgings for tourists throughout the country has increased over the years, but not the qualities. Many of today's tourists are so _ and selective that they'd prefer quality places where personnel should be very responsible and experienced in taking care of them while security should be constantly and effectually maintained,"" she said. Employees and staff in charge of providing accommodations to tourists should be expert in communicating with the foreigners, service-minded and speak fluent English, according to the council leader. Thailand is seen to receive up to 23.1 million tourists from other countries around the world next year, compared to about 21.7 million, who have reportedly visited the country throughout this year, about 2.6 million of whom from China, while as much as two trillion baht (US$66.6 billion) is expected to be earned from tourist industry by 2015, compared to about one trillion baht (US$33.3 billion) this year. Thailand's most favorite destinations for tourists include the world-famous beach resorts of Pattaya and Phuket, the Andaman Sea archipelagos of Krabi and Surat Thani and the capital city of Bangkok. The council leader made her comments in response to news reports that the government might deregulate businesses of running condominiums and apartment houses to the extent that they might not only serve as a place which collects monthly rent from the tenants but as a hotel where guests pay the room rates on a daily basis. No parking lots or hotel-operating licenses might be legally required at such places nationwide only if they were practically turned into daily hotels or guesthouses. </s>"	Piyaman advocated the authorities not to limit the development of the condos. </s>

He has a season ticket and he arranges his work schedule so he does not miss a game. San also attends game dressed in their uniform, and his car is red. He has even lost some friends by choosing to watch the Red Sox instead of going to their weddings. Is this healthy behavior? Although Russell's case is extreme, being a sports fan can be healthy for you. According to a study at the University of Kansan in the USA, sports fans suffer from depression less than people who are not interested in sports, fans also experience other effects from watching their team play. When their team wins a game, their own confidence and happiness increase, just like the athletes. Losing, on the other hand, always leads to some sense of disappointment. What about die-hard fans whose team always loses? The team spirit keeps those fans from losing hope. Knowing that other fans are probably feeling the same way also helps them. In addition, there is always the hope that their team will win the next game. Russell has lost some friends because of his love for baseball and although you may think that would make him unhappy, he has made many more new friends because of his team spirit. For Sam Russell, supporting the Red Sox is not just a hobby; it is a way of life and the secret of his happiness. </s>	prefers going to a game to a friend's wedding </s>

"Question: During their journey in Africa, the two travelers _ . Context: For six hours we shot through the landscape of the Karoo desert in South Africa. Just rocks and sand and baking sun. Knowing our journey was ending, Daniel and I just wanted to remember all we had seen and done. He used a camera. I used words. I had already finished three notebooks and was into the fourth, a beautiful leather notebook I'd bought in a market in Mozambique. Southern Africa was full of stories. And visions. We were almost drunk on sensations. The roaring of the water at Victoria Falls, the impossible silence of the Okavango Delta in Botswana . And then the other things: dogs in the streets, whole families in Soweto living in one room, a kilometre from clean water. As we drove towards the setting sun, a quietness fell over us. The road was empty -- we hadn't seen another car for hours. And as I drove, something caught my eye, something moving next to me. I glanced in the mirror of the car; I glanced sideways to the right, and that was when I saw them. Next to us, by the side of the road, thirty, forty wild horses were racing the car, a cloud of dust rising behind them -- brown, muscular horses almost close enough to touch them, to smell their hot breath. I didn't know how long they had been there next to us. I shouted to Dan: ""Look!"", but he was in a deep sleep, his camera lying useless by his feet. They raced the car for a few seconds, then disappeared far behind us, a memory of heroic forms in the red landscape. When Daniel woke up an hour later I told him what had happened. ""Wild horses?"" he said. ""Why didn't you wake me up?"" ""I tried. But they were gone after a few seconds."" ""Are you sure you didn't dream it?"" ""You were the one who was sleeping!"" Typical, he said. ""The best photos are the ones we never take."" We checked into a dusty hotel and slept the sleep of the dead. </s>"	recorded their experiences in different ways </s>
Question: What do the scientists find in their research? Context: Most people regard zoos as safe places for animals, where struggles such as difficulty finding food and avoiding predators don't exist. Without such problems, animals in zoos should live to a ripe old age. But that may not be true for the largest land animals on Earth. Scientists have known that elephants in zoos often develop diseases, joint problems and behavior changes. Sometimes, they even become unable to have babies. To learn more about how captivity affects elephants, a team of international scientists led by Mason, a biologist, compared the life spans of female elephants born in zoos with female elephants living outdoors in the wild. Zoos keep detailed records of all the animals in their care, documenting factors such as birth dates, illnesses, weight and death. These records made it possible for the researchers to analyze 40 years of data on 800 elephants in zoos. The team found that female elephants born in zoos lived an average of 16.9 years. Their wild counterparts who died of natural causes lived an average of 56 years----more than three times as long. Scientists don't yet know for sure why wild elephants seem to live so much better than their zoo-raised counterparts. Mason thinks stress and obesity may be to blame. Zoo elephants don't get the same kind of exercise as they do in the wild, and most are very fat. Elephant social lives are also much different in zoos than in the wild, where they live in large groups. Another finding from the study showed that elephants born in zoos were more likely to die earlier than elephants captured in the wild and brought to zoos. Mason suggests stress in the mothers in zoos might cause them to have babies that are less likely to survive. The study raises some questions about acquiring more elephants to keep in zoos. While some threatened and endangered species living in zoos reproduce successfully and keep healthy populations, that doesn't appear to be the case with elephants. </s>	Female zoo elephants die earlier than their wild counterparts. </s>
"Question: How many people are very careful not to let their partner know their income? Context: Do you usually go Dutch(AA) when you take someone out to dinner? Do you expect your date to pay for the whole meal? Many people say that as long as there's love, money doesn't matter much. But this might change when the relationship gets serious and it is related to the money borrowed from the bank, the family present accounts and debt. A survey among 8 million couples in the UK suggested that 44% of married couples don't know exactly what their partner earns. An astonishing 23% actively try to keep their finances secret from their partners. About 38% of them are open to each other. Another 12% refuses to tell the truth. British relationship expert Russell says: ""It's very difficult to talk about money. Often there's guilt, there's shame. To start those conversations is difficult. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It's not just a simple case of talking about hard cash."" So if you are in a couple, it might be a good idea to check if you both are on the same page about money before bills pile up on the kitchen table and love flies out of the window. When moving in together, couples should not only talk about their personal habits but also about their financial ones. Russell has a word of advice: ""Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently - there might be a spender or a saver. It's very attractive if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. Do it differently but plan it well."" And now, back to that date.

"Question: All the following factors are a must for making big trees EXCEPT _ . Context: Big trees are incredibly important ecologically. For a start, they provide food for countless other species and shelter for many animals. With their tall branches in the sun, they capture vast amounts of energy. This allows them to produce massive crops of fruit and flowers that sustain much of the animal life in the forest. Only a small number of tree species have the genetic ability to grow really big. The biggest are native to North America, but big trees grow all over the globe, from the tropics to the forests of the high latitudes . To achieve giant size, a tree needs three things: the right place to establish its seedling, good growing conditions and lots of time with low adult death rate. Lose any of these, and you will lose your biggest trees. In some parts of the world, populations of big trees are dwindling because their seedlings cannot survive. In southern India, for instance, an aggressive non-native bush, Lantana camara, is invading the floor of many forests. Lantana grows so thickly that young trees often fail to take root. With no young trees to replace them, it is only a matter of time before most of the big trees disappear. Without the right growing conditions, trees cannot get really big and there is some evidence to suggest tree growth could slow in a warmer world, particularly in environments that are already warm. Having worked for decades at La Selva Biological Station in Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui, Costa Rica, David and Deborah Clark and colleagues have shown that tree growth there declines markedly in warmer years. ""During the day, their growth shuts down when it gets too warm, and at night they consume more energy because their metabolic rate increases,"" explains David Clark. With less energy produced in warmer years and more being consumed just to survive, there is even less energy available for growth. The darks' theory, if correct, means tropical forests would shrink over time. The largest, oldest trees would progressively die off and tend not to be replaced. According to the Clarks, this might cause a destabilization of the climate; as older trees die, forests would release some of their stored carbon into the atmosphere, causing a cycle of further warming, forest shrinkage and carbon emissions. Besides, big trees face threats from elsewhere. </s>"	high-latitude location </s>

Question: It can be inferred from the passage that a major interest of the officials of GlacierNational Parkis to _ . Context: Glacier National Park in Montana shares boundaries with prefix = st1 /Canada, an American Indian reservation, and a national forest. Along the North Fork of the Flathead River, the park also borders about 17,000 acres of private lands that are currently used for ranching, timber, and agriculture. This land is an important part of the habitat and migratory routes for several endangered species that frequent the park. These private lands are essentially the only ones available for development in the region. With encouragement from the park, local landowners initiated a landaus planning effort to guide the future of the North Fork. The park is a partner in an interlocal agreement that calls for resource managing agencies to work together and with the more than 400 private owners in the area. A draft plan has been prepared, with objective of maintaining traditional economic uses but limiting new development that would damage park resources. Voluntary action by landowners, in cooperation with the park and the county, is helping to restrict small lot subdivisions, maintain wildlife corridors, and minimize any harmful impact on the environment. The willingness of local landowners to participate in this protection effort may have been stimulated by concerns that congress would impose a legislative solution. Nevertheless, many local residents want to retain the existing character of the area. Meetings between park officials and landowners have led to a dramatically improved understanding of all concerns. </s>	limit land development around the park </s>
"Question: According to the passage, the ancestors of the Potter family most probably _ . Context: As is often the case, when your teacher asks a question, there is only one correct answer. But there is one question that has millions of current answers. That question is ""What's your name?"" Everyone gives a different answer, but everyone is correct. Have you ever thought about people's names? Where do they come from? What do they mean? People's first names, or given names, are chosen by their parents. Sometimes the name of a grandparent or other member of the family is used. Some parents choose the name of a well-known person. A boy could be named George Washington Smith; a girl could be named Helen Keller Jones. Some people give their children names that mean good things. Clara means ""bright""; Beatrice means ""one who gives happiness""; Donald means ""world ruler""; Leonard means ""as brave as a lion"". The earliest last names, or surnames, were taken from place names. A family with the name Brook or Brooks probably lived near brook ; someone who was called Longstreet probably lived on a long, paved road. The Greenwood family lived in or near a leafy forest. Other early surnames came from people's occupations. The most common occupational name is Smith, which means a person who makes things with iron or other metals. In the past, smiths were very important workers in every town and village. Some other occupational names are: Carter -- a person who owned or drove a cart; Potter -- a person who made pots and pans. The ancestors of the Baker family probably baked bread for their neighbors in their native village. The Carpenter's great-great-great-grandfather probably built houses and furniture. Sometimes people were known for the color of their hair or skin, or their size, or their special abilities. When there were two men who were named John in the same village, the John with the gray hair probably became John Gray. Or the John was very tall could call himself John Tallman. John Fish was probably an excellent swimmer and John Lightfoot was probably a fast runner or a good dancer. Some family names were made by adding something to the father's name. English-speaking people added -s or -son. The Johnsons are descendants of John; the Roberts family's ancestor was Robert. Irish and Scottish people added Mac or Mc or O.

"Question: Why do students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University take part in the World Championship of Mahjong? Context: Mahjong, that favorite pastime of ""old folks"" in Shanghai, is finding a new audience among younger players, and many university students are becoming mad about this traditional Chinese game. Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, ""Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies."" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a ""healthy, scientific, friendly mind game."" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University. There was no prize money, but the players delighted in using their wits and their understanding of statistics and probability theory to defeat their clever opponents. Of course, Mahjong doesn't have to always be that intense. For young people it can be a way to relax and to socialize, a chance to get away from their computers and talk to other people face to face. So, this Spring Festival, why not get out the ""old folks"" tiles: it's good to be mad about Mahjong! </s>"	Because they can happily use their wisdom and what they have learned to defeat their clever opponents. </s>
"Question: What would be be the best title for the passage? Context: A new University of Graz study concludes that vegetarians are more often ill and have a lower quality of living than meat-eaters. According to the German press release, vegetarians ""have cancer and heart attacks more often"". The release also says that they show more psychological disorders than meat eaters. Consequently, the report writes, they are a greater burden on the health care system. According to the press release the scientists evaluated data from the Austrian Health Interview Survey (AT-HIS), which is also part of an important and valuable EU survey (European Health Interview Survey). The scientists examined a total of 1320 persons who were divided up into 4 groups . All groups were comparable with respect to gender, age, and socio-economic status. The study also accounted for smoking and physical activity. Also the BMI was within the normal range for all four groups. The only thing that really was different among the four groups was the diet. The four groups were: vegetarians, meat-eaters with lots of fruit and veggies, little meat-eaters and big meat-eaters. The press release states that the results contradict _ that meat-free diets are healthier. Vegetarians have twice as many allergies as big meat-eaters, and they showed 166% higher cancer rates . Moreover, the scientists found that vegans had a 150% higher rate of heart attacks. In total the scientists looked at 18 different chronic illnesses. Compared to the big meat-eaters, vegetarians were hit harder in 14 of the 18 illnesses. In the analysis, the University of Graz found that vegetarians were also twice as likely to suffer for anxiety or depressions than big meat-eaters. That result was confirmed by the University of Hildesheim, which found that vegetarians suffered significantly more from depressions, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints and eating disorders. The University of Graz scientists also found that vegetarians are impacted more by ilnessses and visit the doctor more frequently. Big meat-eaters were also found to have a ""significantly better quality of life in all categories"", the study found. The four categories examined were: physical and psychological health, social relationships and environment-related life quality. </s>"	Are Vegetarians Healthier </s>

"Question: From the passage, we can guess the gangsters were those _ . Context: There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for ""protection"". If the money was not paid immediately, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop. Getting ""protection money"" is not a modern means. As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters. Then Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a group of soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to those who were willing to pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money with this method. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero .When he died at eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had his picture painted, which was in memory of ""this bravest man"". </s>"	who did harm to others </s>

Question: What does the author probably think of Susan's life stories? Context: Susan Boyle was born as the ninth child in a Catholic family. She suffered from learning disabilities ever since her birth because of her mother's poor health. School was difficult for Susan and she was bulled because of her different behaviour. _ , who were much older, had life experiences that were unknown to their little sister. From the time of her birth, Susan was a screamer. The only really safe place that she would use as a repeat was her bedroom.

"Question: Which can be the best title for the passage? Context: Many grown-ups worry that spending too much time playing video games isn't good for a kid's health. But some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. They also seem to feel less pain when they are giving all their attention on a car race or other games. At a children's center in Baltimore, Maryland, young kids are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called HOPE. Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer get rid of wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must use the dialysis machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play Internet sports, racing, and other games with each other. They will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who have the same problem. ""We want to use the Internet to bring together kids who are ill, and let them know they are not alone,"" said Arun Mathews, the doctor of the program. He loved video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, California, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players got rid of cancer cells. That's all great news, because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal faster. </s>"	Video Games May Help Reduce Pain </s>

"Question: What conclusion can we draw from the passage? Context: Lucy, whose skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974, died shortly after she fell out of a tree, according to a new study published Monday in the British journalNature. For their research, Kappelman and Dr. Richard Ketcham used a CT scanner to create more than 35,000 ""slices"" of Lucy's skeleton. Scientists named her Lucy from the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", which was played at the camp the night of her discovery. The following analysis of the slices showed sharp, clean breaks seen at the end of Lucy's right humerus are similar to bone breaks seen in victims of falls. The researchers concluded that these and other breaks in her skeleton show that Lucy, who is believed to have stood about 3 feet 6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds, fell feet first and used her arms to support herself -- but that the injury was too severe to have been survivable. The researchers estimate that Lucy was going about 35 miles an hour when she hit the ground after falling from a height of roughly 40 feet, according to the statement. That sounds _ . But other scientists are doubtful. ""There are countless explanations for bone breaks,"" Dr, Donald C, Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, said, ""The suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a just-so story and therefore unprovable."" Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy's breaks occurred long after she died, saying that ""elephant bones appear to have the same kind of breaks, It's unlikely they fell out of a tree. "" But the new research focused on ""a small number of breaks"" that are consistent with ""high-energy bone-to-bone influences"" and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in other collected bones. Kappelman responded in an email, ""These appear to have occurred at or near the time of death."" </s>"	The argument on how Lucy died will continue. </s>
Question: What type of writing does this passage belong to? Context: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. </s>	A news report </s>

Question: According to the passage, the interviewer, Bruce, was very _ . Context: I was being interviewed by a senior manager for a big company, I told him honestly that the _ reason that I was interviewing with them was my need to keep my family in Boston. My wife had recently died of a heart attack. A job in Boston would help me reduce some pain for my 16-year-old daughter and me. It was important to me to keep her present high school. Bruce, the interviewer, was politely kind, but he didn't search any further. He acknowledged my loss and, with great respect, moved on to another subject. After the next round of interviews, Bruce took me to lunch with another manager. Then he asked me to take a walk with him. He told me that he had lost his wife. And, like me, he had also been married 20 years and had 3 children. I realized that he had experienced the same pain as I had and it was almost impossible to explain to someone who had not lost a loved one. He offered his business card and home phone number and suggested that, should I need help or just want someone to talk to, I should feel free to give him a call. Whether I got the job or not, he wanted me to know that he was there if I ever needed help. From that one act of kindness, when he had no idea if we could ever see each other again, he helped our family deal with one of life's greatest losses.

"Question: The best way for parents to have their baby eat properly is to _ . Context: Remember, from the moment they are born, our children have the ability to know when they are hungry - and they cry to let us know too! Of course, they also cry to let us know they are wet, hurt, or bored, but we soon learn to tell the difference and try to meet each need somehow. When we begin to feed them solid foods, they let us know when they have had enough by turning away from the spoon - or refusing the food back at us! Why is it that once children are old enough to sit at the table their parents are often heard bargaining with them or threatening them to finish all their dinner? When we make our children eat up the plate that we filled, we don't pay attention to their born ability to know how much, and what, their bodies need. Instead, we should allow them to use their own hunger feelings to determine how much they need, while we provide a balance of nutritious and ""fun"" foods. When we teach them about moderation and set a great example by living an active, healthy lifestyle, they will be less likely to develop weight problems later in life. Think of your slim friend who eats whatever she wants -but will refuse ice cream if she has had enough to eat! ""Eat all your dinner if you want dessert"" translates to ""you must overeat so I will reward you by letting you overeat some more!"" By using sweets as a reward for good behavior, kids begin to believe sweets are really special and they may want them even more. Instead, by making dessert just another (small) part of an enjoyable meal, kids learn to ""save room for dessert"" instead of becoming a member of the ""clean plate club."" </s>"	set a great example by living an active and healthy lifestyle </s>

""Schedule a visit with a doctor who specializes in travel or the area you're visiting at least four weeks before your departure,"" says WHO public health expert Dr. Gilles Poumerol. A travel doctor will be able to give you the required and recommended vaccinations as well as discuss any medical issues you may come across abroad. Get insurance. ""In many countries where you have limited access to health care, good health care is only found in the private sector and can be very expensive,"" Dr. Poumerol says. Plus, in an emergency, returning to the United States can cost more than $50,000. Ask your health insurance company whether your policy applies overseas and whether it will cover trips to a foreign hospital. If not, there are many companies that offer short-term travel health insurance for a reasonable fee. A list can be found on the US State Department's travel website. Ks5u Pack well. Dr. Poumerol also suggests bringing a note from your doctor in English and the language of the country you're visiting. Packing an emergency contact list is important. Contacts should include the local embassy , s who should be informed if you get sick and your health insurance company. Be care. You have to be in charge of your health. If you're being treated abroad, question the medical staff about their sterilization practices; injection equipment should be put in boiling water for at least 30 minutes or used only once. Also be sure that doctors and nurses are wearing gloves to prevent fluid transfer. Limiting your alcohol intake will keep you focused on your safety. If your common sense is perfect, the rest of your body should follow. </s>"	which companies offer short-term travel health insurance </s>
"Question: The writer thinks that the U.S.government's definition for the homeless reveals _ . Context: According to the United States government, people are classified as homeless if they have no place to stay and no expectation of finding a place for the next thirty days.Although technically accurate, that is an impersonal assessment of an enormous and very human problem. The homeless population represents all of us Americans.It includes men and women, the elderly, children, and infants.Its members are from all ethnic groups.What they have in common is poverty. Currently in the U.S., thirty-nine million people live in poverty.When money is really tight, paying the rent or buying food often becomes a choice.Government assistance in the form of food stamps does help but, as one homeless man explains, you can't pay the rent with food stamps. With no money for rent, the streets and homeless shelters become the alternative. Although men constitute the largest group within the homeless population, homeless women with children are rapidly joining them.In fact, one quarter of the homeless people in the U.S.are teenagers and young children. People may become homeless for numerous reasons.However, there are certain factors that many of these individuals have in common.They include a lack of adequate education and job skills.A majority of the teenagers and adults have not completed high school. The abuse of alcohol and drugs is also a common factor.One third of the adult homeless population abuses alcohol.While one quarter of the same group uses drugs. Some members of this population suffer mental health problems.Within the past several years many institutions for the mentally ill have been closed and their patients sent ""home"".Unfortunately, a number of those people have no home to go to and they are unable to adequately look after themselves. Job loss in today's economy has also become a real factor in the loss of people's homes.The breakup of families through abandonment and divorce are also contributing factors, particularly when there are children involved.The parent who is left to care for the kids with inadequate income may be forced to depend on the homeless shelters to put a roof over their heads. </s>"	an unsympathetic attitude toward the homeless </s>

Question: What kind of people need less sleep according to the research? Context: Wake Up,Sleep Gene Some people can stay up all night and still get work done the next day.I'm not one of them.After a night without enough sleep,I feel bad-tempered.I have trouble remembering things.And all I want to do is crawl back into bed and sleep. How do you feel after you've stayed up late to finish schoolwork? Or the day after an overnight party? Scientists now say that your answers to these questions may depend on your genes. New research suggests that a gene called period 3 affects how well you function without sleep.The period 3 gene comes in two forms: short and long.Everyone has two copies of the gene.So,you may have two longs,two shorts,or one of each.Your particular combination depends on what your parents passed on to you. Scientists from the University of Surrey in England studied 24 people who had either two short or two long copies of period 3.Study participants had to stay awake for 40 hours straight.Then,they took tests that measured how quickly they pushed a button when number flashed on a screen and how well they could remember lists of numbers. Results showed that the people with the short form of period 3 performed much better on these tests than the people with the long form did.In both groups,people performed worst in the early morning.That's the time when truck drivers and other night-shift workers say they have the most trouble concentrating. After the first round of experiments,participants were finally allowed to sleep.People in the group that performed well on the tests took about 18 minutes to nod off. People with the long period 3 genes,by contrast,fell asleep in just 8 minutes.They also spent more time in dip sleep.That suggests that people with the long form of the gene need more and deeper sleep to keep their brains working at top form. I think I must have the long form of period 3.What about you? </s>	Those with two short copies of the gene </s>

Nick has a small foot on his left side, which helps him balance and enables him to kick. He uses his one foot to type, write with a pen and pick things up between his toes.

Throughout his childhood Nick dealt with the typical challenges. At the age of seven, Nick tried out some specially designed electronic arms and legs, in hope that he would be more like the other kids. During the short trial period of the electronic arms and legs, Nick realized that even with them, he was still unlike his peers at school, and they turned out to be much too heavy for Nick to operate, affecting his flexibility quite significantly. ""When I was 13 I read a newspaper article about a disabled man who had managed to achieve great things and help others,"" said Nick, ""I realized why God had made us like this - to give hope to others. It was so inspirational to me that I decided to use my life to encourage others and decided to be thankful for what I do have, not get angry about what I don't.""

Question: What will social networking websites do? Context: In the past, friendships were greatly limited by time, space and attention; increasing home and workplace mobility has made it even harder to keep social relations over time. Through a combination of user controls, new technologies and changing standards of social behavior, Facebook is freeing us from these limitations, making friendships more accessible, pleasant and diverse than ever before. First, Facebook allows you to find and rediscover friends and then reminds you of these connections, so that you are less likely to fall out of touch with the long-lost school friend, or the family member in a different country. 'Second, Facebook creates an environment that allows you to interact easily with others : you can share your photos,videos,links and thoughts with your friends, and respond to what they share in turn. Third, Facebook's unique technical system helps you to discover your friends,most valuable stories. These technologies allow people to keep and enrich friendships that they might otherwise have been unable to keep. The effect of this is very great. A recent study by Keith Hampton for the Pew Internet and American Life Project discovered that users of social networking websites have larger, more diverse social circles, online and offline. This outcome comes at no cost to one's closest relationships, which are kept in person and over the phone. Instead, the hour that the average user spends each day socializing on Facebook comes at the expense of less social activities, such as the three or so hours a day the average person spends watching television. Time may limit our ability to keep social ties, but our desire for social communication is limitless. Just as boats have allowed us to cross oceans and vehicles have allowed us to move mountains, Facebook is a tool that allows us to stay more deeply connected with a larger and more diverse set of friends. </s>	Increase the diversity of social relations. </s>

Context: Even if he is not the most liked comedian in China today, his popularity certainly has risen the fastest within the last two months. He's ""Little Shenyang"", who came into national fame overnight after his appearance on CCTV's Spring Festival Gala. With his funny cross-dressing, unique northeastern accent and superb imitative skills, Little Shenyang has obvious talent to support his rise to fame. Hundreds of video clips of his shows have been posted on YouTube and other online video sites, and his performance fees reportedly grew 50-fold in just a few weeks. He has, at the same time, become one of the most controversial of entertainers. Many have doubted his artistic potential, pointing out that his shows were repetitive and lacked creativity, a key to continued comedic success. Others belittle the style of humor, saying it's too crude and appeals only to less-educated people. His defenders were just as up in arms. Many media commentators and bloggers said that his quick rise to star proved the broad appeal of his art form. He became a national champion not because of his ""northeastern hick "" humor, they argued, but because he represented something new on TV, something with a grassroots feel that appealed to millions of ordinary people. Now, does Little Shenyang really deserve his star status? </s>"	The style of humor lacked creativity. </s>
Question: Where did street art begin? Context: Street art is very popular around the world. You can find it on buildings, street signs and trash cans from Tokyo to Paris, from Moscow to Cape Town. Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world. Many people in the city, however, say that seeing a picture on the Internet is never as good as seeing it live . </s>	In New York. </s>
"Question: The price of the knives was cut down by half because _ . Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world.

If you speak softly, make an effort to speak clearly -- don't make your date have to work to hear you. *What others will hear you say.

"Question: According lothe passage,what can defend the parents' child rearing? Context: What is the main testing ground of fears about incomplete or inadequate child reariry? The college admission process. If you are afraid you don't discipline your children enough,the evidence of parental failure is right there in front of everyone. The child is not filling out her college applications ! lf you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades,you will have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is,from my perspective,a cover for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have seen manv parents,dive back into their children's lives at college admission time, trying to fill all of their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to be sure as their children leave the nest that they reall} have taught them how to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this point,the next best thing is the status of the colege to which the child is admitted. From the point of an anxious parent,an ""Ivy l,eague college"" child is proof of better child rearing than a ""small college"" child. I once sat with a talented,weak senior girl and her brilliant parents. She,they,and the school had to decide whether she should remam m school or go into a hospital. In light of her anorexia( ) ,the school recommended strongly that she not file her early application to Princeton. Upon hearing this,the girl looked at the adults in the room and said,""If I can't apply early to Princeton,l'll die. "" Her parents were also eager to have her get into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because,in this case,something was wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in her upbringing,this child was not happy or self-confident. Yet she was eighteen,the culture required her to leave home. The psychological solution for them all was the comforting vision of a great college. Somehow going there would make her life fine and defend her parents' child rearing. Such fears about letting go of an unfmished child exist in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope. For parents looking for a painkiller,the college admission process is where they can work out their anxieties. </s>"	A great college. </s>

"Question: This passage tells us _ . Context: Do you want to know how and why a fall leaf changes color? We first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are the world's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take CO2from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and CO2into glucose , a kind of sugar. Plants use it as food for energy and growing. A chemical called _ in the leaves gives plants their green colour. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter, and trees ""know"" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough sunlight or water. Trees rest during this time and live on the food they store during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. As the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples , sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn the glucose in the leaves into a red colour. And we can enjoy the beautiful red leaves during autumn. </s>"	not all the colors of the leaves are from chlorophyll </s>

Question: From the passage we learn that Kindle is a device which _ . Context: Dear Customers, I love slipping into a comfortable chair for a long read, as I relax into the chair. I also relax into the author's words, stories, and ideas. The physical book is so elegant that it disappears into the background, and what remains is the author's world. Today, we at Amazon are excited to announce Kindle, a wireless, portable reading device with instant access to more than 90,000 books, magazines, and newspapers. We've been working on Kindle for more than three years. Our top design objective was for Kindle to disappear in your hands --to get out of the way --so you can enjoy your reading. We also wanted to go beyond the physical book. Kindle is wireless, so whether you're lying in bed or riding a train, you can think of a book, and have it in less than 60 seconds. No computer is needed--you do your reading directly from the device. We chose the same wireless technology used in advanced mobile phones. But unlike mobile phones, there are no monthly wireless bills, no service or data plans, and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install(,). We want you to get lost in your reading and not in the technology. Kindle uses a new kind of display called electronic paper. Sharp and natural with no strong light, reading on Kindle is nothing like reading from a computer screen. Kindle weighs only 10.3 ounces --less than a paperback --but can carry two hundred books.

"Question: It can be inferred that the slaves in the same ship _ . Context: During the early years of American settlement, a new form of English was beginning to develop in the islands of the West Indies and the southern part of the mainland, spoken by the black population. The beginning of the seventeenth century saw the happening of the slave trade. Ships from Europe travelled to the West African coast, where they exchanged cheap goods for black slaves. The slaves were shipped in terrible conditions to the Caribbean islands and the American coast, where they were in turn exchanged for such products as sugar and molasses . The ships then returned to England, completing an ""Atlantic triangle""of journeys, and the process began again. Britain and the United States had outlawed the slave trade by 1865, but by that time, nearly 200 years of trading had taken place. By the middle of the nineteenth century, there were over four million black slaves in America. The policy of the slave-traders was to bring people of different language backgrounds together in the ships, to make it difficult for groups to plan rebellion. The result was the growth of several pidgin forms of communication, and in particular a pidgin between the slaves and the sailors many of whom spoken English. Once arriving in the Caribbean, this pidgin English continued to act as a major means of communication between teh black population and the new landowners, and among the blacks themselves. Then, when children came to be born, the pidgin became their mother tongue, thus producing the first black Creole speech in the region. This Creole English rapidly came to be used throughout the cotton plantations , and in the coastal towns and islands. </s>"	spoke different languages </s>

"Question: American and British spy agencies were both particularly interested in the information gathered from _ . Context: The NSA and GCHQ are tapping popular smart phone apps such as Angry Birds to gather the enormous amounts of very personal data those bits of software collect--including age, gender, marital status, income, education level and more, according to new reports from the New York Times and The Guardian. Citing secret documents provided by Edward Snowden, former NSA staff, the reports detail efforts to gain data collection from cell phone carriers and smart phones by tapping into ""leaky"" apps themselves. Both spy agencies showed a particular interest in Google Maps, which is accurate to within a few yards or better in some locations and would clearly pass along data about the area where phone owner is. ""It effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system,"" reads a secret 2008 report by the NSA's sister spy agency, according to the New York Times. More surprising is the wide range of apps that the agencies search for data, including innocent-seeming apps such as Angry Birds. One document in particular from GCHQ listed what information can be found from which apps, mentioning Android apps but suggesting the same data was available from the iPhone platform. Angry Birds maker Rovio Entertainment of Finland said it had no knowledge of any NSA or GCHQ programs for tapping into its users' data. ""Rovio doesn't have any previous knowledge of this matter, and have not been aware of such activity in 3rd party advertising networks,"" said Saara Bergstrom. ""Nor do we have any involvement with the organizations you mentioned."" Mobile photos uploaded to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter appear to be a particularly rich source of information for the spy agencies as well. Metadata in the photos is briefly available. The NSA and GCHQ are able to tap into that metadata to collect a wealth of key data points about a person's life. ""NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission,"" the agency told the Times in response to questions about the program. During a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Jay Carney stressed that same position. ""As the president said in his Jan. 17 speech, to the extent data is collected by the NSA, through whatever means, we are not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets and we are not after the information of ordinary Americans,"" he said. </s>"	Google Maps </s>

Question: Which of the following sentences is FALSE? Context: The new year has begun and some people may be looking to 2015 as the year they get a dog. A furry friend will bring a lot of fun and companionship to your family -- especially for urban residents who always feel lonely living in the fast-paced society. But looking after a pet does require some responsibility from the pet owner if you want your new friend to be healthy and happy in your family. The following is a checklist for people who are considering adopting an animal. Where to find a dog There are hundreds of pet shops in Shanghai, big and small, where you can find puppies at a cost ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands of yuan. The pet shop will tell you some basic facts about dogs of a specific breed. But don't forget to ask about the vaccination status if you are buying a puppy, which needs three injections with an interval of three to four weeks between shots. Another option is to ask your friends if they know anyone with a dog that has recently had puppies. This option is more reliable than buying a puppy from someone you don't know, especially the street peddlers who might carry animals with diseases. Another highly recommended option is to adopt one from an NGO dedicated to providing shelter and protecting stray animals. This is quite practical if you don't care about the dog's breed. Vaccination As a pet owner, there are some things you must do otherwise you may get into big trouble, and one of these is getting your dog vaccinated. Dogs need regular shots to fight against canine parvovirus , rabies and other diseases or viruses. To ensure the vaccines are not substandard, we strongly recommend you get your furry friend a shot from a qualified _ , which may cost a few hundred yuan each year. Another advantage of using the vet as opposed to getting your dog vaccinated yourself, is that the vet will examine its condition to see whether it is suitable to get a shot now and take immediate action if it has an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Because you are advised not to give your animal a bath for one week following its vaccination, you should clean your animal one or two days before the shot if you don't want your dog to get too dirty. Parasite protection As a pet owner, you need to be prepared to get rid of fleas , heartworm , roundworm , intestinal worms and other parasites from your dog. Dogs need regular flea and tick control and parasite protection, even if it does not show symptoms of being affected by the parasite. An adult dog needs to be fed with a tablet every six months to make sure it does not have any parasite. You also need to take measures every three months to help expel fleas and ticks from your animal. You need to learn the signs of a flea bite: they may immediately cause a dog to feel extremely itchy. Within 30 minutes of a bite, they may develop a red bump. Secondary infections caused by scratching are also common. Dog training No dog is born with good manners. Pooping on the carpet, leaping enthusiastically onto guests, pulling so hard that it practically yanks your arm out of the socket when on walks -- that's all perfectly acceptable in the canine world. It's up to you to teach your dog to behave the way humans want it to. Despite the adage(;) about old dogs and new tricks, there are no age limits to teaching dogs. And whether you've got a brand-new puppy or an older dog, the first step is the same: learn how to be a good teacher. Every dog is different and will respond better to a slightly different training style, but these general guidelines apply: stay consistent and patient, and reward your dog for getting it right. </s>	As a pet owner, it is unnecessary for you to be prepared to get rid of fleas. </s>
Question: According to the text, which of the following statements is true? Context: Research shows that humans switch from selfish to unselfish behavior when they are watched. Do you? A picture of a set of eyes on a computer screen can cause a change in the way people act. Even images of eyes on a charity donation, collection box encourage people to be unselfish, because people put more money in a collection box that has a picture of eyes on it than they do when a flower symbol is on the box. Manfred Milinski from the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany and Bettina Rockenbach of the University of Berlin, the authors of a new study, found that people act better when they are being watched because they feel they will be rewarded for good behavior. Their report also referred to other research showing that this response of behaving well when watched is somehow _ into humans and people respond this way unconsciously, or without realizing it. It is not just humans that act unselfishly when they are being watched. A fish called the grooming fish cleans other fish. When other fish are around, it is gentler. When no other fish are around, however, the grooming fish bites chunks from the fish it is supposed to be cleaning. The researchers suggest that the best way to get people to behave in the correct way is to make them feel watched. This could be the reason for the success of a famous American army poster. On it was a picture of an elderly man staring fiercely and pointing, it appeared, to the person who was looking at the poster. Under the picture was the caption 'I Want You' It encouraged hundreds of thousands of young American men to join the army during the Second World War to fight the Germans and Japanese. </s>	People donatemore money when they feel they are watched. </s>
"Question: Why didn't the young man's mother and sisters answer him? Context: A young man once went to town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went to his room and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long. He went into the kitchen, and his mother and two sisters were doing some washing there. He said to them, ""The new trousers are too long. They need cutting by two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me?"" His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything. But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went to her son's room silently and cut the trousers by two inches. She came back without saying anything to her daughters. After supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She went to his room and cut the trousers by two inches without saying anything to anyone. The younger sister went to the cinema. But when she came back, she also remembered her brother's trousers. So she went to his room and cut them by two inches, too. </s>"	Because they were busy at that time. </s>
"Question: What do we learn from the passage about Comic Relief? Context: If you watch British television on Friday March 15, you might be surprised to see celebrities wearing funny red noses and joking around. But don't worry, they're not mad, it's all part of a biennial fund-raising event called Red Nose Day. Organized by the charity Comic Relief, founded in 1985 by two British comedians, the aim of the event is to raise money to fight poverty and injustice in the UK and Africa. Celebrities and public figures support the event by making appearances on comic TV shows broadcast by the BBC. This year, for example, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appeared in a music video by One Direction, which the band produced for the event. But Britons don't just raise money for charitable causes on one day a year, they do it all year round. One way of doing so is by shopping in charity shops. These small, inconspicuous shops sell clothes, books and household goods just like any other shop. But there's one big difference--it's all secondhand. There are nearly 10,000 charity shops in the UK, according to the Charity Retail Association. Their business model is simple: Anybody who has things they don't want anymore can donate them to a charity shop, where they are checked for damage, cleaned and priced. Most items go back on sale at a small part of their original price and the money that is made by selling them is used for a charitable cause. The idea of buying used clothes may sound off-putting, but for shoppers who have less spending money, such as the elderly or those in low-paying jobs, it has been a welcome option for years. Now, ""thrifting""--shopping at charity shops-- is also becoming popular with young people looking for alternative fashion. ""I love shopping at thrift stores. You can find very unique clothes for a very cheap price. It doesn't bother me that other people may have worn them, I simply wash them before I wear them,"" said Anne Marie, a 19-year-old Internet user from the US, in a comment on a Yahoo forum. So next time you spot a charity shop, why not go inside? Who knows, you might find a lovely dress for just a few pounds. Even better, you can enjoy wearing it in the knowledge that your money helped a good cause. </s>"	It organizes the Red Nose Day fund-raising event. </s>
Question: What time of the year do the people in the passage pick strawberries? Context: It is a beautiful day in June. The sun is hot. It's time to harvest strawberries ,and the strawberry fields are full of people. These people are picking strawberry. They are not farmers, and they are picking fruit for fun. They can buy strawberries in a supermarket but it is cheaper to pick their own fruit. Strawberries from the farm are also flesher . Most people also like to pick their own fruit because it is a pleasant way to spend the afternoon. One little boy is walking between the rows of plants. He is picking the strawberries and eating them as fast as he can. Two young women in pretty dress and high-heeled shoes are getting out of their car. Now they are taking off their shoes.

Question: What articles comment on controversial issues? Context: The role of a newspaper is to present and comment on the news. It is vital for keeping people well-informed on current affairs. In most Western countries, journalists try to shape the ideas and opinions of their readers, since in Western countries all newspapers are independent of the government. Some newspaper owners support liberal ideas including economic policies that help poor people. Other owners want policies such as lower taxes for rich people and less money to be given to poor people. You can almost judge the political ideas of a person in the West by looking at the newspaper he reads. All newspapers report national and international news. They give the facts but also provide opinions on controversial issues in the editorials and columns of opinion. The readers of the newspaper can also comment on these editorials or articles. There are many informative articles too as well as reviews of new films and books, etc. These are very important, for if a film or book gets good reviews it will often become more successful. All these articles require many journalists who are experts in different areas of life. All these articles come together and are checked by the chief editor of the newspaper. When he or she has made a decision on the articles, the newspaper is prepared for printing. All this work means that the journalists must work together as a team because there is a lot of pressure when you work in a newspaper office. There are constant deadlines and articles have to be fitted round advertisements, photographs and much, much more. </s>	Editorials and opinion columns. </s>
"Question: Which of the following can't be used to describe the dog? Context: After my husband died suddenly from a heart attack, my world crashed around me. My six children were all under 10, and I was burdened with the responsibilities of earning a living, and caring for the children. I was fortunate to find a wonderful housekeeper to care for the children during the week, but from Friday nights to Monday mornings, the children and I were alone. One Friday evening I came home from work to find a big pretty German Shepherd on our doorstep. This dog seemed to intend to enter the house. The children liked ""German"" immediately and begged me to let him in. I agreed to let him sleep in the basement. That night I slept peacefully for the first time in many weeks. The following morning we made phone calls and checked lost-and-found ads for German's owner, but with no results. On Sunday I had planned to take the children on a picnic. Since I thought it best to leave German behind in case his owner came by, we drove off without him. When we stopped to get gas, we were amazed to see German racing to the gas station after us. No way was he going to be left behind. Monday morning I let him out for a run. He didn't come back and we were all disappointed. We were convinced that we would never see him again. We were wrong. The next Friday evening, German was back on our doorstep. Again he stayed until Monday morning, when our housekeeper arrived. This pattern repeated itself every weekend for almost 10 months. We grew more and more fond of German. We took comfort in his strong, warm presence, and we felt safe with him near us. As German became part of the family, he considered it his duty to check every bedroom to be sure each child was cozy in bed. Each week, between German's visits, I grew a little stronger, a little braver and more able to handle; every weekend we were no longer alone and enjoyed his company. Then one Monday morning we patted him on the head and let him out for what turned out to be the last time. We never saw German again. </s>"	Wild. </s>
Question: What can be inferred about the author? Context: For many years, I had a belief that my suffering was due to my size. I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts, and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our worst mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved,being special, and being cherished. We fantasize about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal. We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long while to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes toward ourselves, the whole world changes. </s>	The author has been troubled by her/ his weight. </s>
"Question: If the passage is taken from a website, which part of the website does it belong to? Context: There was once a blind man, who did a lot of traveling alone. He was making his first trip to Texas and happened to be seated next to a Texan on the flight. The Texan spent a lot of time telling him how everything was bigger and better in Texas. After the blind man reached his destination, a large resort hotel, he was very excited about being in Texas. The long trip had worn him out a little so he decided to stop at the bar for a small soda and a light snack before going up to his room to sleep. When the waitress set down his drink, it was in a huge cup. ""Wow, I had heard everything in Texas is bigger,"" he told her. ""That's right,"" she replied. The blind man ate his snack and finished his drink. After drinking such a large amount, it was natural that his next stop was to be the restroom. He asked the waitress for directions. She told him to turn left at the corner, and then take the second door on the right. He reached the first door and continued. A few steps later he stumbled slightly and missed the second door and ended up going through the third door instead.

Question: For a quiet traveler, he is most likely to choose _ . Context: You want to have fun and adventure and so you decide to travel somewhere to do it. Sounds like a simple enough thing. And basically it is. But what is adventure? That is the key here and the answer can be different for different people. For those who love sports, adventure travel can have a whole different meaning than for those who like history. The physical travel types that you can find include such adventure travel as white water rafting , kayaking or climbing and hiking to some mountains somewhere. To the hiker, backpacking across Ireland might be their adventure. For this type of person, adventure travel almost always includes something physical. Often the goal is to push their body's limits and test their individual endurance . For those who less want to climb mountains, adventure travel might mean traveling to Nepal and taking in the local festivals. Wine tasting in Italy is also vacation adventure for the more relaxed traveler who enjoys peace and comfort. Anything that is opposite to the normal scope of the traveler's lifestyle defines adventure. Adventure travel is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all type of vacation. Adventure depends on the person's physical limits, how much money the person has and what the person enjoys doing. Going _ the normal is adventurous for many. If your life is quite busy, then sitting on a beach in the moonlight with your family might be adventure for you. The point is not what you do but that you have a good time and that it is an adventure for YOU -- not for the person next to you. Do not sit home this year when vacation time rolls around. Go beyond your normal routine and try something new. If you usually spend your vacation sun-bathing on a beach, try hiking, instead, through the mountains. Look around you, think beyond your comfort zone and head out on an adventure vacation. </s>	wine tasting in a bar </s>

Not until the eleventh century, when a young lady from Constantinople brought her fork to Italy, did the custom reach Europe. By the fifteenth century the use of the fork was wide-spread in Italy. The English explanation was that Italians were unwilling to eat food touched with fingers, ""seeing all men's fingers are not alike clean.

"Question: According to the passage,which people seem to age slower than the others? Context: If you want to stay young,sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise, and as a result,we are ageing unnecessarily soon. Professor Taijiu Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern prefix = st1 /Japanappeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a ly early age, and how the process of ageing could be slowed down. With a team of partners at Tokyo National University,he set about studying the brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and various jobs. Computer technology enabled the researchers to get exact measurement of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain,which relate to intellect and feelings,and determine the human character. The back section of the brain,which controls functions like eating or breathing,does not connect with age. One can continue living without intellectual or feeling abilities. Contraction of front and side parts - as cells die off - was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not obvious in some sixty and seventy year olds. Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple cure for the contraction normally connected with age using the brain. The findings show in general conditions that contraction of the brain begins soon among people in the country than in the town. Those are at least at risk,says Matsuzawa,who are lawyers,followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing regular work in government offices are, however,as likely to have shrink as the farm workers,bus drivers and shop assistants. Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must flow through a circle properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need.

"Question: How would the author describe the animals' life in zoos? Context: How could we possibly think that keeping animals in cages in unnatural environments-mostly for entertainment purposes-is fair and respectful? Zoo officials say they are concerned about animals.How ever, most zoos remain ""collections"" of interesting ""things"" rather than protective habitats .Zoos teach people that it is acceptable to keep animals bored, lonely, and far from their natural bones. Zoos claim to educate people and save endangered species , but visitors leave zoos without having learned anything meaningful about the animals' natural behavior, intelligence, or beauty.Zoos keep animals in small spaces or cages, and most signs only mention the species' name, diet, and natural range .The animals' normal behavior is seldom noticed because zoos don't usually take care of the animals' natural needs. The animals are kept together in small spaces, with no privacy and little opportunity for mental and physical exercise.These results in unusual and self-destructive behavior called zoophobia.A worldwide study of zoos found that zoophobia is common among animals kept in small spaces or cages.Another study showed that elephants spend 22 percent of their time making repeated head movements or biting cage bars, and bears spend 30 percent of their time walking back and forth, a sign of unhappiness and pain. Furthermore, most animals in zoos are not endangered.Captive breeding of endangered big cats, Asian elephants, and other species has not resulted in their being sent back to the wild.Zoos talk a lot about their captive breeding programs because they do not want people to worry about a species dying out.In fact, baby animals also attract a lot of paying customers.Haven't we seen enough competitions to name baby animals? Actually, we will save endangered species only if we save their habitats and put an end to the reasons people kill them.Instead of supporting zoos, we should support groups that work to protect animals' natural habitats. </s>"	Unhappy. </s>

"Question: To understand your abilities and how to use them in your life, you should calculate your _ . Context: Just as some people think that certain numbers are lucky or unlucky, others believe that we can use numbers to understand our personalities, or predict what will happen to us in the future. Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the ""master"" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities. They also believe that we can predict our destinies, how our lives will progress, and what challenges we may face along the way. To the numerologist, numbers can be used in many more ways than we think. </s>"	Expression number </s>

Context: Rocky Lyons was five years old when his mother,Kelly,was driving along the country road with him.He was asleep on the front seat of their truck,with his feet resting on her lap.As his mom drove carefully down the winding country road,she turned onto a narrow bridge.The truck hit a rock and slid off the road.She attempted to bring it back up onto the road by pressing hard on the gas pedal and turning the steering wheel to the left.But Rocky's foot got caught between her leg and the steering wheel and she lost control of the truck. The truck fell into a 20foot ravine .When it hit bottom,Rocky woke up.""What happened,Mama?"" he asked.""Our wheels are pointing toward the sky."" Kelly was seriously wounded and blinded by blood.""I'll get you out,Mama,""announced Rocky,who had surprisingly escaped injury.He climbed out from under Kelly,slid through the open window and tried to _ his mother out.But she didn't move. ""Just let me sleep,"" begged Kelly,who was out of consciousness.Rocky insisted,""Mom,you can't go to sleep."" Rocky managed to push Kelly out of the truck and told her he'd climb up to the road and stop a car to get help.Fearing that no one would be able to see her little boy in the dark,Kelly refused to let him go alone.Instead they slowly moved up to the road.The pain was so great that Kelly wanted to give up,but Rocky wouldn't let her. Rocky kept repeating the inspirational phrase,""I know you can,I know you can.""When they finally reached the road,Rocky broke into tears seeing his mother's torn face clearly for the first time.Waving his arms and shouting, ""Please stop!"" the boy stopped a truck.His mother was sent to hospital. It took 8 hours to rebuild Kelly's face.She looks quite different today--""I used to have a straight long nose,thin lips and high cheekbones;now I've got a flat cheeks and much bigger lips""--but she has few scars and has recovered from her injuries. Rocky's heroics were big news.Everyone was surprised at this little boy's power.""It's not like I wanted it to happen,"" the boy explained.""I just did what anyone would have done.""

"Question: People got their milk mainly from their own animals _ . Context: Milk was one of the main foods of people long before history was written. It will probably keep on being one as long as there are animals that give milk. Even the word ""milk"" is very old. It comes from Sanskrit ( ), one of the oldest languages known to man. A very old picture of _ has been found. It was drawn more than five thousand years ago. In the years long ago, people got their milk from their own animals. But later new inventions made the milk industry a big business. In 1851 Gail Borden found a way to take some of the water out of milk. This made it keep much longer. Four years later, Louis Pasteur introduced a way to kill the bacteria ( ) in milk. Next, a special milk bottle was made. This was followed by the invention of machines that could fill bottles with milk. These discoveries had a great effect on the milk industry. They meant that milk could be stored longer. Some people believe that milk drinking will become less popular that it has been. But remember how long milk has been an important food and think of many ways in which it is useful. It seems safe to say that milk industry will always be important. </s>"	before a number of inventions were made. </s>
"Question: Which of the following is most likely to be the title of the passage? Context: He's out there somewhere, an instant icon in the records of American conflict, the final big-game hunter. But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. He is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. He's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the ""SEALs Team 6"" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. He was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. ""They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'"" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. ""It's getting very scientific."" Marcinko puts it in more conventional terms: ""He'll be ripped,"" says the author of the best-selling autobiography ""Rogue Warrior.""""He's got a lot of upper-body strength. Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach."" On this point, Greitens departs a bit. ""You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,"" says the author of ""The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL."" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission. The shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. ""He's bearded, rough-looking, like a street naughty boy,"" Marcinko supposes. ""You don't want to stick out."" Marcinko calls it ""modified grooming standards."" His hands will be calloused , Smith says, or just rough enough,"" as Marcinko puts it. And ""he's got frag in him somewhere,"" Marcinko says, using the battlefield shorthand for ""fragments"" of bullets or explosive devices. This will not have been the shooter's first adventure. Marcinko estimates that he might have made a dozen or more deployments , tours when he was likely to have dealt with quite a number of dangerous situations, getting ready any time for explosive devices or bullets. </s>"	Who shot Bin Laden? </s>

Question: Warneken and his partners worked with _ . Context: When an animal helps another animal, it usually gets something valuable in return. For a long time, many scientists thought that only people could act generously just because it feels good. However, a new study in Germany suggests that chimpanzees also do good things for no real reason. And so do children who are as young as 18 months of age. Maybe it is because humans and chimpanzees share an ancestor about 6 million years ago. People and chimpanzees appear to develop such features without any other training, says Warneken, a scientist in Germany. Warneken and his partners worked on adult chimpanzees that live on an island in the African country of Uganda. They also worked with 18-month-old children in Germany. The researchers performed three experiments on the adult chimpanzees and two experiments on the kids. In the first animal experiment,a person tried to reach his arm into a cage to get a stick,but he couldn't reach it. A chimpanzee was in the cage,and it could reach the stick if it wanted to. Thirty-six chimpanzees took part in this experiment one by one, and no chimpanzee saw what the other chimpanzees had done. Even though the animals hadn't met the person before, they usually took the stick and gave it to the person. What's more, they did this whether or not the person offered them bananas as a reward. In a similar experiment, 36 children acted in a similar way. They helped the person reach the stick, whether or not they were offered toys for their help. Researchers did other experiments on chimpanzees and babies. No rewards were offered in either experiment. And still, both the chimpanzees and children went out of their way to help. Still, the new study is different from earlier findings. Researchers have found that chimpanzees don't give rewards of food to other chimpanzees, even if it costs them nothing to be generous. </s>	18-month-old children who live in Germany </s>
"Question: The two books have in common everything EXCEPT_. Context: Editor's notes: AWL is well known for its dictionaries and English language teaching materials. Some readers have written in to ask us for the latest information on high quality books on English, so here we introduce two texts that aim to improve spoken English fluency. Let's speak (Beginner) By Bev Dusuya, Naoko Ozeki and Kevin Bergman ISBN: 962001359X Speak Up(Pre-Intermediate) By Bev Kusuya, Nako Zeki ISBN: 0583338050 ""Teach the students about your culture and help them talk about their own."" How often are these worthy goals kept from being achieved by the limitations of your beginner level learners? Students at all levels want to talk about culture. Topics include food, shopping, sports, fashion, the roles of men and women, health, music, and many more. These are all chosen from surveys of over 15,000 students about their own interests in cross-cultural communication. ""Let's Speak"" and ""Speak Up"" share a special but excellent way that allows all students to take part in. The series has questions which start thinking and then help collect opinions about personal topics. Conversation practice is provided by ready to use models of basic exchanges on the topic. Also, the cultural information presented in the series comes in the form of interesting, relevant facts and ideas from other countries through listening tasks and Culture Quiz exercises. Team activities in books provide lively problem solving games to enable sharing and comparison of cultural values. ""Let's Speak"" is fit for entry level students of all ages. ""Speak Up"" provides for the needs of higher level beginners, offering the same careful listening and speaking help, but with slightly more open ended discussion.

"Question: What happened to the plan of sending an ad into space? Context: A few years ago, a company called Space Marketing came up with a plan to send a mile-long advertisement into space. To advertising agencies , it would have been ""a dream come true"". However, advertising standards agencies finally decided not to allow Space Marketing to go ahead with their plans and they were forced to give them up. Space may indeed be the final place for advertisers, because on Earth we are already surrounded by advertising wherever we are and whatever we are doing. Apart from the obvious adverts that we see every day on TV, and in newspapers and magazines, there is a whole ' _ ' of advertising messages for our attention. There are ads that we see on the side of the bus we catch to work, for example. And what about the logos we see on the clothing of the people we walk past in the streets? Most of the time, we are probably not even aware of these less obvious advertising methods, but that doesn't mean that they don't work. Take 'product placement', for example. You are in a cinema, watching the latest Hollywood movie. Look carefully at the make of car your favorite actor is driving. And what about his watch? Can you see what brand it is? Chances are, you can, and the company that owns the brand is likely to have paid thousands for it to appear in the film. So, whether Space Marketing finally succeeds in sending ads into space or not is perhaps less important than it might seem. This would not change a thing. Our everyday lives are already strongly influenced by advertising whether we realize it or not. </s>"	It came to nothing. </s>
"Question: The head teller covered up his crimes _ . Context: In many businesses, computers have largely replaced paperwork, because they are fast, and do not make mistakes. And they are honest. Many banks say that their business is ""untouched by human hands"" and therefore safe. But they have no thought that the growing number of computer crimes show they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even if they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there is often no proof. A computer cannot remember who used it. It simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer whose money he had stolen questioned the balance in his account, the teller said it was a computer mistake, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught at last. Some workers use the computer's power to punish their bosses they consider unfair. Recently, a large company fired its computer record assistant for reasons that were connected with her personal life rather than her job. She was given thirty days notice. In those thirty days, she stole all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been common workers. Now police wonder if this is ""the tip of iceberg"". As one official says, ""I have the feeling that there is more crime out there than we are catching. What we are seeing now is all so poorly done. I wonder what the real experts are doing--the ones who really know a computer works."" </s>"	by moving money through computers </s>

Question: When were some of his best pieces written? _ . Context: Beethoven, a famous musician in the world, was born in Germany in 1770. In his childhood Beethoven didn't have a happy life.His father was a singer. When he was only four, his father began to make him practise hour after hour on different musical instruments . If he did not put his heart into it, his father would beat him or make it hard on him. Beethoven loved music and he learned so fast that he was able to go around to give concerts, when he was only a boy of eleven. At the age of seventeen, he won high praise from Mozart, the great musician at that time. Beethoven was often poor and ill during his life. After one illness, he suddenly found himself deaf. At that time he was only thirty-one. It was a blow to him indeed. But he still went on working and writing music pieces.

Question: _ may be adopted in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2014 according to the passage. Context: The Oxford English Dictionary (OED, ) is thinking of adding the Chinese word tuhao to its 2014 edition . The word has become popular in China during the past few months to describe newly rich people who spend money in extravagant(,)ways. Tuhao has in Western countries, too, to describe similar people in their countries. The adoption of the word by foreign countries is an example of China's spreading influence in the world not just economically, but also socially and culturally. People are paying attention to what is happening in China and are picking up some Chinese words in the process, especially those words that express unique Chinese ideas that cannot be easily translated into English. The OED is also thinking of adding hukou and dama to the already 120 Chinese words in its dictionary. Hukou refers to China's system of residency permits and dama refers to middle-aged Chinese women whose gold buying habits influence the global gold markets. The news that the OED was adding these words has met with some criticism . Some people say the words embarrass China, but others insist that in a globalized society it's natural for words to spread and be adopted elsewhere. In fact, a word like tuhao expresses the humor of China. It's easy to pronounce and very accurate at poking fun at rich people who have more money than taste. </s>	All above </s>
"Question: The main idea of the passage is about _ . Context: Death Valley is a land of beautiful yet dangerous extremes. Death Valley can be dangerously cold during the winter months. Storms in the mountains can produce sudden flooding on the floor of the Valley. The air temperature during the summer has been as high as fifty- seven degrees Celsius. The sun can heat the ground so that the temperature of the rocks and soil can be as high as seventy -four degrees Celsius. Death Valley contains evidence of several ancient volcanoes that caused huge explosions. Evidence of one of these explosions is called Ubehebe Crater. The explosion left a huge hole in the ground almost a kilometer and a half wide. In many areas of Death Valley it is easy to see where the ground has been pushed up violently by movement deep in the Earth. This movement has created unusual and beautiful rock formations. Some are red. Others are dark brown, gray, yellow or black. The area was named by a woman in 1849. Thousands of people from other parts of the ountry traveled to the gold mining areas in California. They were in a hurry to get there before other people did. One group trying to reach California decided to take a path called the Old Spanish Trail. By December they had reached Death Valley. They did not have to survive the terrible heat of summer, but there was still an extreme lack of water. There were few plants for their work animals to eat. The people could not find a pass through the tall mountains to the west of the Valley, Slowly, they began co suffer from a lack of food.

"Question: For what reason were Thorn McAn shoes turned down in Bangladesh? Context: If a business wants to sell its products internationally, it had better do some market research first. This is a lesson that some large American corporations have learned the hard way. What's in the name? Sometimes the problem is the name. When General Motors introduced its Chevy Nova into Latin America, it overlooked the fact that Nova in Spanish means ""It doesn't go"". Sure enough, the Chevy Nova never went anywhere in Latin America. Translation problems Sometimes it is the slogan that doesn't work. No company knows this better than Pepsi-Cola, with its ""Come alive with Pepsi!"" campaign. The campaign was so successful in the United States , Pepsi translated its slogan literally for its international campaign. As it turned out , the translations weren't quite right. Pepsi was begging Germans to ""Come out of the grave "" and telling the Chinese that ""Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave."" A picture's worth a thousand words Other times, the problem involves packaging . A picture of a smiling baby has helped sell countless jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries, the picture on the jar shows what the jar has in it, for many people there can't read. Twist of fate Even the culture and religious factors and pure coincidence can be involved. Thorn McAn shoes have a Thorn McAn ""signature"" inside. To people in Bangladesh, which is a Muslim country, this signature looked like Arabic script for the word Allah.

Question: What does the writer think of collecting stamps? Context: Starting a stamp collection is easy and not very expensive. Before you start, you need to decide what kind of stamps you want to collect. Most people collect stamps that they are interested in: a certain country or an animal, a famous person or even a sport.

American Secretary of State John Kerry spoke last Monday at a press conference in London. He was reacting to questions about possible American action to answer a chemical weapons attack believed to be likely in Syria. One reporter asked the secretary whether there is anything Syria's president can do to avoid an American military strike. ""Sure, he can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international society in the next week.""www.ks5u.com Mr. Kerry made it clear that he was speaking theoretically, and did not expect anything like that to happen. But Russia seized on the idea and persuaded Syria to do the same. That brought plans for American congressional votes on military action to a halt.

Mr. Obama has said the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must be punished for breaking the nearly century old ban on the use of chemical weapons. He called for American action to prevent future use of chemical weapons in Syria. He suggested limited airstrikes on government targets. The airstrikes could happen quickly if Congress approves.

Because of this, they feel unhappy about learning at school. According to a survey, a pupil has to spend two hours finishing the homework every day. It usually takes three hours for a middle school student and four hours for a high school student to finish the homework every day. Students in Grade Nine often do their homework until midnight. And all of them have to get up at as early as six o'clock the next morning. Mr. Li, a doctor in a hospital, told me yesterday, ""Half of the students in Shenzhen are sub-healthy .

Question: Which of the following is true? Context: Children are children after all, and most of them speak their mind. When they are just toddlers , they are all lovely and lively. And it's so interesting to watch them speak like a grown-up. But as they grow, these same kids seem annoying and ill-mannered if they try to be a grown-up. Conflicts go between parents and children. It's hard to tell who are right and who are wrong. A child of 7-8 always finds some reasons to have a conflict with it's parents. Whether it is about some toy, studies, a party or a company, there is always a difference between them. And it becomes worse when they answer you back. Scientists tell us that children should be treated with care. Yes, sure they should respect their elders. We are partly responsible for this. At an early age we encourage children to behave like adults, just because we find it funny. The kids on the other hand consider this same behavior as normal and get used to it. And when it is not funny for us any more, we expect them to stop it, but by then it is already too late. Only when they reach a certain maturity will the children realize that answering back and being rude are not acceptable . Until then, most of the time their behavior is difficult to change, unless by force . And use of force is against the every good idea, as it weakens the child's confidence. So it is one thing to bring a child into this world but quite another to make them into well mannered citizens. The best way is to be a good example ourselves, as our children are the mirrors of us adults. </s>	Children often copy what their parents do. </s>
Question: How is the text organized? Context: All over the world, libraries have begun the Herculean task of making faithful digital copies of the books, images and recordings that preserve the intellectual effort of mankind. For armchair scholars, the work promises to bring such a wealth of information to desktop that the present Internet may not match. Librarians see three clear benefits to going digital. First, it helps them preserve rare and fragile objects without refusing the demands of those who wish to study them. The British Library, for example, holds the only medieval manuscript of Beowulf in London. Only qualified scholars were allowed to see it until Kevin S. Kiernan of the University of Kentucky scanned the Manuscript with three different light sources and put the images up on the Internet for anyone to use. A second benefit is convenience. Once books are changed to digital form, readers can find them in seconds rather than minutes. Several people can read the same book or view the same picture at the same time. Clerks are spared the chore of reshelving. And libraries could use the Internet to lend their collections to those who are unable to visit in person. The third advantage of electronic copies is that they occupy millimeters of space on a magnetic disk rather than meters on a shelf. The cost of library buildings is increasingly high. The University of California at Berkeley recently spent $ 46 million on an underground addition to house 1.5 million books----an average cost of $30 per volume. The price of disk storage, on the contrary, has fallen to about $ 2 per 300-page publication and continues to drop. </s>	Message - Explanation </s>
"Question: According to the article, how are koalas and kangaroos alike? Context: A Koala Isn't a Bear Koalas remind people of teddy bears.They have thick fur and large ears.Their broad, flat nose makes them look cute, similar to teddy bears.In fact koalas aren't cute.They have sharp teeth and very sharp claws! Koalas are marsupials.This means the mother carries her baby in a pocket while it develops, similar to a kangaroo.The baby koala lives in its mother's pocket for the first six months of its life. The name ""koala"" comes from a native Australian word that means ""no drink"". The koalas get almost all their water from the eucalyptus leaves they eat.That's where they get their food too.Koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves, and only the leaves of certain eucalyptus trees.The eucalyptus trees are where the koalas live.It's also where they sleep.Koalas sleep about nineteen hours a day! Why do they sleep so much? Some people think it's because they're lazy.But koalas aren't lazy.They sleep so much because there isn't much nutrition in eucalyptus leaves.Koalas store hardly any fat, so they must save their energy.One way to do this is to move slowly and sleep a lot. After a day of sleeping they like to move around and eat just after sunset.They live alone most of the time.Koalas are very protective of their trees.If a koala sees another koala eating in its favorite tree, it might tell the other koala to leave by ""barking"" at it.Koalas do ""talk"" to each other.Besides barks, the males make a deep grunting sound.The mothers and babies talk in soft clicking sounds.If they get scared they may scream like a baby. </s>"	They both carry their young in a pocket. </s>
"Question: According to the study,fathers don't read to their kids mainly because _ . Context: Three quarters of Britain's parents are too busy to read bedtime stories to their children,according to a study. The study was carried out by CITV to start their new children's show Bookaboo,which is designed to encourage anyone to pick up a book and read with their children at any time of the day. Worryingly,the study showed that only three percent of fathers now find the time to read to the kids compared to 89 percent of mothers. Lucy Goodman,creator of Bookaboo,said,""It's important for young boys to be able to share a book with dads,granddads or male carers and it can be fun and rewarding,too."" Of the dads who said they didn't read to their kids, 87 percent blamed work while more than a third said they were too tired. While 89 percent of mums said they did read to their children,more than half of them said cleaning distracted them and 49 percent were distracted by other household things. Researchers also found parents are now relying heavily on other people to lend a hand with reading to their children with grandparents doing the most,followed by sisters and brothers,aunts and uncles. While 95 percent of parents read to their children at some point,only five percent read to their children during the day. More than one in ten said they read every couple of weeks or less,and five percent could not remember the last time they shared a book. The study found parents also seem content with allowing their children to immerse themselves in TV programs or playing computer games rather than reading. Exgoalkeeper David Seaman,who is a dad of two,has been a guest in Bookaboo. He says,""I think it's important that fathers do read to their children because it's a special time. Sometimes my two children will come to listen to the same book--it's a magical moment and I advise fathers just to try it."" </s>"	they are too busy with work </s>
Question: In 1939, President Roosevelt put forward the national day of Thanksgiving to _ . Context: A turkey named Courage gave thanks to President Obama for saving his life on the day before Thanksgiving. Honouring a 62-year-old tradition, the President pardoned the bird on Thanksgiving eve. The tradition of a turkey pardon at Thanksgiving began with President Truman in 1947. Courage comes from Ellsworth, Iowa. The name Courage was chosen by voters who took part in a survey posted on the White House website. The lucky turkey walked on the lawn of the Rose Garden and posed for the cameras at the presidential podium . The dinner that has become known as the First Thanksgiving was actually a harvest festival celebrated in December of 1621. That's when English settlers in Plymouth, Massachusetts, gave thanks for the progress they had made after a hard winter in their new country. As America grew, Thanksgiving customs also spread and got bigger. George Washington declared that the first national Thanksgiving would be on November 26, 1789. In the decades to follow, however, people celebrated Thanksgiving locally, with no official date. President Abraham Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November 1863 a national day of Thanksgiving. It stayed that way until 1939, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved it one week earlier. He wanted to lengthen the shopping period before Christmas to encourage gift-buyers and to help businesses. So Congress ruled that, after 1941, Thanksgiving would be an official federal holiday falling on the fourth Thursday of November. This year we celebrated Thanksgiving on Thursday, November. Millions of Americans got together to give thanks with friends and family. The lucky turkey, Courage, was one of them. After his pardon, Courage would be sent to Disneyland Resort in California, where he would be the grand assemble of Disney's Thanksgiving Day Parade. </s>	encourage the economy </s>
"Question: How are the old and new houses the same? Context: Uganda is a country in East Africa and,as in many such countries,a high percentage of the population,about 80 percent,are village-dwellers living in huts,which are often no bigger than a garage. The walls of the huts are made of mud,which is held together by reeds and sticks,and the roofs of the older ones are thatched with grass,although an increasing number of newer village houses have roofs made from corrugated iron. Several generations of the same family live together in the huts,which are usually divided into two sections by a curtain. The inner section,the one furthest from the open door of the hut,is where everyone sleeps and food is prepared and served in the outer part. If the family owns chickens or goats,they are kept in a small room attached to the main house. Food is usually prepared on open fires although some people prefer to cook inside. However,this is quite dangerous and also means that the walls of the hut are stained by smoke and the atmosphere is acrid. The family sit in a circle on mats while they eat. Newer village houses are almost always made of corrugated iron and are bigger,with one or two separate bedrooms and the kitchen in a smaller building beside the main house. But,old or new,the houses are not powered by electricity,and all homes are lit by paraffin candles called ""tadobba"". Nor is there any running water in the houses. Some villages have their own well,but in many cases,collecting water involves a long and arduous walk to a river or spring,carrying plastic containers or pots made of clay. Children are the ones who have to fetch water,and they have to do this early in the morning before they go to school,or in the evening when they come home. They often have to climb high hills or walk through valleys with narrow paths through dense vegetation. It is no surprise that they grow up muscular and fit after such daily exercise,walking for several kilometres carrying such heavy weights. </s>"	Neither of them have electricity,lights or running water. </s>

Question: According to the passage, which of the following facts contributes to the obesity rate? Context: In 2030, 42 percent of American adults will be obese, and about one-quarter of that group will be severely obese, a condition that shortens life and wastes large medical expenses, a new study predicts. Obesity related _ -- diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure -- consume at least 9 percent of health-care spending the United States. Some researchers believe the cost may be twice that estimate. Total health spending is about $2.6 trillion a year. In 2030, 42 percent of people are projected to be obese, and 11 percent severely obese. Obesity is a body mass index , which suggests 85 kg for someone 1.67 meters tall. Severe obesity is 112 kg for someone that height. Obesity is rising in higher-income men. Severe obesity is increasing in both sexes. It was 6.2 percent in women in 1999 and 8.1 percent in 2010. For men, it was 3.1 percent in 1999 and 4.4 percent in 2010. It is believed that the obesity rate is closely related to the following factors: the price of gasoline, which discourages walking when it is low; access to the Internet (and other technologies), which encourages long periods of sitting still; and restaurants per 10,000 people, which increases eating out and weight gain when the number goes up. Urgent measures must be taken to inspire people to exercise more and educate people about better eating habits before too many people will be suffering from being . obese. </s>	People are used to eating out in restaurants. </s>

I am new to the anonymous act of kindness concept. I came across it recently. A few weeks ago I worked up the courage to ask the barista if I could pay for a coffee for someone later that day. He looked at me kind of strangely and said ""okay"" and then put the money into the drawer where some change was put. I walked out feeling doubtful whether this would happen and privately thinking he might just add the money to his tips. This chain stamps a card every time you buy a coffee and when you get 9 stamps, the 10th coffee is free. I had just completed my card today and was due a free cup of coffee next time, so I cheered up as I headed out of the coffee shop. I believe that giving the card to people on the street is better than giving them cash so I forgot about the barista and passed the card on to a homeless guy I met later. A week later I was in the same store and I ordered my usual coffee and a new barista said to me, ""Your coffee is on us."" I was surprised and asked why he would give me a free coffee.

By late Thursday, 4,900 people were declared homeless after the quake destroyed their homes in a mountainous area lying on the border between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The dawn quake left one dead and 39 injured, destroyed 268 houses and damaged 1,132 other buildings so seriously that they were considered uninhabitable . Another 2,400 houses suffered less serious damage. The center of the earthquake was near the scenic Lugu Lake, a tourist place, where the local school was badly damaged. In the beginning people thought that the economic losses would add up to about 180 million yuan (22 million dollars). Governments in Yanyuan and the neighboring Yunnan country of Ninglang have joined forces in the rescue efforts and tents, clothes and medicine are badly in need of for the earthquake victims.

Question: From the text we can infer that _ . Context: When I walk through the streets, I pass strange rooms where people are doing strange things. Some are biking madly. Others are holding metal bars to keep them from dropping down. Still others are jumping around while someone is shouting at them. It looks like something out of Dante's Inferno (<<>> <<>> ). But what is the most amazing is that people pay for these sufferings! The strange rooms are gyms. It is reported that some 41 million Americans are gym members. 12% of the memberships are born in January, as they are determined to knock off the holiday fat. Maybe it is good to exercise in the gym. However, should they know they can keep in good shape, spending little money, would they still agree with its necessity? At the age of 23, I joined a gym. I lifted weights twice a week in Muscle's Gym. I paid as little as $200 per year. You can't find such gyms in every city any more. Too often, the gym is fancy with lots of equipment. If you ask how much it costs to join it, the person at the front desk often won't tell you straight. Instead, he'll let you meet with a fitness consultant , who will provide you with a great number of reasons and suggestions, such as losing weight and getting healthier, just in order to put pressure on you to spend much money joining the gym and becoming a member there. Working out with the help of equipment at home has problems, too. In the early 2000's, I bought a spinning bike at a cost of $700 for home use.

"Question: Snow-blindness may be avoided by _ . Context: Many people believe the glare from snow causes snow-blindness. Yet, dark glasses or not , they find themselves suffering from headaches and watering eyes, and even snow-blindness, when exposed to several hours of ""snow light"". The United States Army has now determined that glare from snow does not cause snow-blindness in troops in a snow-covered country. Rather, a man's eyes frequently find nothing to focus on in a broad expanse of barren snow-covered terrain . So his gaze continually shifts and jumps back and forth over the entire landscape in search of something to look at. Finding nothing, hour after hour, the eyes never stop searching and the eyeballs become sore and the eye muscles ache. Nature eases this irritation by producing more fluid which covers the eyeball. The fluid covers the eyeball in increasing quantity until vision blurs , then is obscured , and the result is total, even though temporary, snow-blindness. Experiments led the Army to a simple method of overcoming this problem. Scouts ahead of a main body of troops are trained to shake snow from evergreen bushes, creating a dotted line as they cross completely snow-covered landscape. Even the scouts themselves throw lightweight, dark colored objects ahead on which they too can focus. The men following can then see something. Their gaze is arrested.

Question: Aeroplanes usually do not need to climb quickly or fly high in the polar region because _ . Context: We all know that it is possible for ordinary people to make their homes on the equator ( ), although often they may feel uncomfortably hot there. Millions do it. But as for the North Pole ---- we know that it is not only a dangerously cold place, but that people like you and we would find it quite impossible to live there. At the present time only the scientists and explorers can do so, and they use special equipment. Men had been traveling across and around the equator on wheels, on their feet or in ships for thousands of years; but only a few men, with great difficulty and in very recent time, have ever crossed the ice to the North Pole. So it may surprise you to learn that, when traveling by air, it is really safer to fly over the North Pole than over the equator. Of course, this is not true about landings in the polar region (which passenger aeroplanes do not make). But the weather, if we are flying at a height of 5,000 meters above the Pole , is a delight. At 4,000 meters and more above the earth you can always be sure that you will not see a cloud in the sky as far as the eye can reach. In the tropics , on the other hand, you are not certain to keep clear of ( ) bad weather even at such heights as 18,000 or 20,000 meters . Aeroplanes can't climb as high or as quickly in cold air as in warm. Nor can clouds. In practice, this is an advantage to the aeroplane, which is already at a good height when it reaches the polar region and so it does not need to climb, while at the same time cold air keeps the clouds down low. </s>	there are no clouds above 5000 meters </s>
Question: Which type of music below can make people eat faster? Context: We know music is very important in our daily life. Do you notice music playing at any of those places when you go somewhere? Today most stores, stations, restaurants and other places play music. You might even hear music in an office or on a farm. Scientists believe that music influences the way people behave . They think that the sound of western classical music makes people feel richer. When a restaurant plays classical music, people spend more money on food and drinks. When the restaurant plays modern music, people spend less money. Without music, people spend less. Scientists also believe that loud, fast music makes people eat faster. Some restaurants play fast music during their busy hours. This makes people eat faster and leave quickly. Restaurants can make more money in this way. Some scientists think that music makes you think and learn better. They say that music helps students to be more active. It is true that people learn better when they are relaxed. And listening to music can help you relax.[ The next time you hear music somewhere, be careful. It might influence the way you do things. ,. </s>	Rock music. </s>
"Question: Happiness is for _ Context: Happiness is for everyone . You don't need to care about those people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on . Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely .and those who have cars may want to work on the country roads at their free time . In fact , happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it.When you are in trouble at school,your friends will help you;when you study hard at your lessons,your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health;when you get success,your friends will say""Cingratulations""to you;when you do something wrong,people around you will help you to correct it.And when you do something good to others,you notice them,and you can see that happiness is always around you. Happiness is not the same as money.It is a feeling of your heart.When you are poor,you can also say you are happy,because you have something else that can't be bought with money.When you meet with difficulties,you can say loudly you are very happy,because you have more chances to challenge yourself.So you cannot always say you are poor and you have bad luck.As the saying goes,""Life is like a revolving door.When it closes,it also opens.""If you take every chance to get, you can be a happy and lucky person. </s>"	all people </s>
"Question: In his study Professor Smith asked the subjects_. Context: Professor Smith recently persuaded 35 people, 23 of them women, to keep a diary of all their absent-minded actions for a fortnight. When he came to analyse their embarrassing lapses ( ) in a scientific report, he was surprised to find that nearly all of them fell into a few groupings, nor did the lapses appear to be entirely random . One of the women, for instance, on leaving her house for work one morning threw her dog her earrings and tried to fix a dog biscuit on her ear. ""the explanation for this is that the brain is like a computer,"" explains the professor. ""People programme themselves to do certain activities regularly. It was the woman's custom every morning to throw her dog two biscuits and then put on her earrings. But somehow the action got reversed in the programme,"" About one in twenty of the incidents the volunteers reported were these ""programme assembly failures,"" Altogether the volunteers logged 433 unintentional actions that they found themselves doing -- an average of twelve each, There appear to be peak periods in the day when we are at our zaniest . These are two hours some time between eight a.m. and noon, between four and six p.m. with a smaller peak between eight and ten p.m. ""Among men the peak seems to be when a changeover in brain 'programmes' occurs, for instance between going to and from work."" Women on average reported slightly more lapses- 12.5 compared with 10.9 for men probably because they were more reliable reporters. A startling finding of the research is that the absent-minded activity is a hazar of doing things in which we are skilled. Normally, you would expect that skill reduces the number of errors we make. But trying to avoid silly lapses by concentrating more could make things a lot worse or even dangerous. </s>"	to keep a record of what they did unintentionally </s>

"Question: According to the passage people raise chickens probably to _ . Context: More and more Americans are showing an interest in healthy and locally-produced food. As the interest increases, raising chickens has been gaining popularity in some American cities. ""Look, we get three eggs this time."" Collecting eggs is a daily pleasure for the Hurst family. Naomi Hurst says her family started to raise chickens in back of their home in Maryland a month ago. ""We have wanted to try having backyard chickens for a couple years now. And really just didn't have the time to build my own coop(;) and look out where to buy chickens. And then we met Rent a Coop,"" said Naomi Hurst. Rent a Coop is a chicken rental business. Tyler Phillips launched the company with a partner 18 months ago. It comes with a mobile coop on wheels, two egg-laying hens, feed, bedding, water bowl, feed bowl, and our 24-hour chicken hotline. You can call with any questions. The price is 185 dollars for four weeks. After the four weeks passed, individuals can extend the rental agreement, return everything or purchase the animals and supplies. Tyler Phillips designs and makes the coops. He says he wants to do as little damage as possible to the environment. ""We always try to have as many recycled materials as possible. And I want the coops to be safe for kids. I want the chickens to be comfortable and they have access to the grass while being inside the coop. I want it to be easily movable, light weight,"" he said. Some cities require people have large pieces of land, if they want to raise farm animals. Others require an agreement with neighbors, limit the number of chickens, or, even ban the birds. Tyler Phillips expects that would change as interest in small poultry coops grows. ""I see cities around the D. C. area changing laws almost monthly and different cities will change the law to being prochicken . That is happening all around the United States,"" he said, He believes that there will be chicken rental businesses in most American cities within five years. </s>"	get safe and healthy food </s>

"Question: What did the US scientists of the University of Texas find out in their recent study? Context: THERE is an old saying: ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" It means that you shouldn't build your first impression of someone on his or her looks alone. But according to a new study, the famous sayingmight not be correct after all. A group of US scientists have found that the first impression we have of someone else is actually right most of the time. In the study, scientists asked participants to look at a photograph of a person and make a quick judgment about him or her. A month later, the participant and the person in the photo were introduced, and scientists were shocked to find that their judgments oftenmatch those that they had made originally. It's true that simply looking at someone won't provide you with as much information.But, according to scientists, when makinga first impression, people rely more on their instincts than on logic .""They focus on how that person makes them feel,"" Paul Eastwick of the University of Texas told Live Science. ""It is very hard to get a sense of this information when simply viewing a profile .As soon as one sees another person, an impression is formed and what we see can sometimes _ what we know."" Of course, no one can be right about everything and your instincts can go wrong sometimes. But even if it is proven to be wrong, once people form an opinion about someone, they have a hard time getting over that opinion later on. The findings help explain why people always tidy themselves up before meeting guests or doing job interviews. ""Their face constantlyremindsus of that firstimpression,"" said Rule.

When you walk on the road, you will find a lot of people riding bicycles to school, shops and anywhere else. Therefore , China is known as ""the kingdom of bicycles"". In China, many families have one or two bicycles. Compared(......) with cars, bicycles have many advantages. First, they are much cheaper than cars. Most Chinese can't afford cars, but they can afford bicycles. Second, bicycles are small enough to park anywhere, while cars need a larger piece of land to park. What's more, with lower speed, bicycles are safer than cars. However, bicycles also bring some problems. Some riders don't obey the traffic rules and some riders don't think about others' safety.

"Question: Rats have all the following advantages except that _ . Context: Everybody hates rats. But in the earthquake capitals of the world - Japan, Los Angeles, Turkey - rats will soon be man's new best friends. What happens after an earthquake? We send in rescue dogs. Why? Because they can smell people. Dogs save lives. They help rescuers to find living people. But dogs are big and they can't get into small spaces. So now a new research project is using a smaller animal to save lives: the rat. How does it work? First, the rat is trained to smell people. When this happens, the rat's brain gives a signal .This is sent to a small radio on its back, and then the rescuers follow the radio signals. When rat's brain activity jumps, the rescuers know that someone is alive. The rat has smelled that person. Although there are already robots which can do this job, rats are better. Christian Linster at Cornell University, New York, says, ""Robots' noses don't work well when there are other smells around. Rats are good at that. "" Rats can also see in the dark. They are cheaper and quicker to train than dogs, and unlike robots, they don't need electricity! The ""rat project"" is not finished, but Julie Ryan of International Rescue Corps in Scotland says, ""It would be fantastic. A rat could get into spaces we couldn't get to, and a rat would get out if it wasn't safe.""

Question: The passage is mainly about Fleming's _ . Context: Karl Fleming joined the military because he needed a change in his life. He had a successful career with a shipping company but he wanted to do something more. He found that something in the U.S. army. Fleming began his service in 2009 and never looked back. A few years later, Fleming volunteered to go to Afghanistan. There, he worked as a bodyguard for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He enjoyed it, except for the almost-nightly rocket attacks. Karl was never hit directly by a rocket, but he didn't need to be to feel its effects. The rockets caused severe shaking, shaking so bad that Fleming was left with many injuries. He was also diagnosed with concussions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD). Fleming said he was down but not out. Once he returned from Afghanistan, Fleming underwent one test after another. At first, Fleming said he thought he could recover or be able to return to duty and realize his dream of becoming an officer. But then came the news he had never imagined: Fleming would never be an officer because he was too injured to continue. Fleming said he was depressed after learning his military career was over. Add that to the memory loss, extreme anxiety and the many painful medical procedures he was already experiencing. He rarely ventured outside on the weekend. Instead, he preferred to sleep in. All that changed, however, with Fleming's service dog, Kuchar. Fleming said he had heard dogs could help people suffering from PTSD, so he started doing research. Karl eventually selected K9s for Warriors, which is where he met Kuchar, a yellow lab. Fleming and Kuchar trained together for weeks, before returning to Fort Benning. K9s for Warriors provided Fleming with Kuchar and the training for free. Life with Kuchar has been life-changing. Fleming doesn't sleep in any more because Kuchar won't let him. Instead, they venture out into a world Karl was once afraid of -- a world for Fleming that now seems impossible to imagine without Kuchar by his side. </s>	change of life </s>
"Question: How has the author organized the article? Context: Bluebirds looking secretly from nest boxes. Tadpoles swimming in a pond. Tiger swallowtails flying quickly around a butterfly bush. And over here, a class of students watching it all. A field trip to a nature center? No, it's a schoolyard. With some work on your part, it could even be your schoolyard. Interested in building a schoolyard habitat? Here's how to get started. Gather a Team Students can do a lot on their own, but you'll need adults for a project this big. Get teachers, parents, and even the headmaster interested. Don't forget the maintenance staff--they know more about your school's yard than anyone else and can give you lots of help. Also, ask around your neighborhood for gardeners, naturalists, and others willing to give advice. Map Your Site Which part of the schoolyard can you turn into a habitat? Is there an unused corner of the playground? Part of a lawn or field you could let go wild? You'll need to make a map of the area showing what's there now. Then you can figure out how you want to change it. For that, you need a plan. Plan a Habitat Here's what you'll need to make your area attractive to wildlife. Food: Plant flowers, bushes, and trees. These provide seeds, berries, leaves, flowers, and sweet liquids. And all of these feed birds, and insects. You can also add some feeders for squirrels and birds. Where possible, stick with native plants--wild plants that grow naturally in your area. They need less care, which means less work for you. Water: A small pond, birdbath, or even a shallow dish of clean water in the ground will attract birds. Other small animals like insects may visit as well. Shelter: Bushes and trees make great escapes for birds. Tall grass and ""weeds"" are home to grasshoppers, garter snakes, and some ground-nesting birds. You can also add stone piles and brush piles. Places to Raise Young: Butterflies need special plants to lay their eggs on. Frogs and toads lay eggs only in shallow water. Many birds use birdhouses; others nest in trees and bushes. In fact, nearly all your shelters may become homes for wild young. Put It on Paper Using the map you made of your area, draw in the changes you want to make. Mark where the plants, nest boxes, and other items will go. Remember, this is a long-term plan--you don't have to do everything this spring. Maybe you could put up a few birdhouses and plant some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build the habitat. You'll also need people to help maintain it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in. Set a date, and get growing! </s>"	By giving step-by-step instructions. </s>
Question: In what year was Little League established? Context: In the United States and several other countries, 2.5 million children play baseball in an organization called Little League. They play on teams in their hometowns. Their parents and other adults in the community coach or instruct them and serve as umpires to make sure that everyone follows the rules. Local businesses give money for the ball fields and the uniforms. Local teams compete against each other and the winners get to play teams that are more distant. Eventually, the top teams go to the Little League World Series. One hundred years after Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839, Little League got started in Pennsylvania. Three men started the game for neighborhood boys with a smaller playing field and fewer innings than adult baseball. Little League became popular after World War II when the game spread across the United States. By 1955 it was played throughout North America and within five years it had spread to Europe. Children's baseball really caught on in Japan and Taiwan of China and teams from those areas won the World Series seven out of eight years. After this, the organization tried banning foreign teams from the World Series, but the ban came to an end after one year. At first, Little League was only for boys aged nine to twelve. However, in 1974, the parents of girl baseball players brought a law suit. The courts ruled that Little League had to include both boys and girls. Later Little League added on softball and other games for teenagers up to age eighteen. Occasionally a Little Leaguer becomes a professional player. For example, Gary Carter went from Little League to play nineteen seasons in the Major Leagues, ten of them as an All-Star player. But, by and large, youngsters play baseball for fun and because their parents are proud of them. </s>	1939 </s>

Question: When did Mandela ask the prison authorities for the permission to start a small garden? Context: My Garden -----by Nelson Mandela In early 1977, the authorities announced the physical labour and arranged some kind of work for us to do in the courtyard. The free time also allowed me to hunt what became two of my favorite hobbies in Robben Island---gardening and tennis. To survive in prison, one must develop ways to take satisfaction in one's daily life. One can feel fulfilled by washing one's clothes so that they are particularly clean. Just as one takes pride in important tasks outside of prison, one can find the same pride in doing small things inside prison. Almost from the beginning of my sentence on Robben Island, I asked the authorities for permission to start a garden in the courtyard. For years, they refused without offering a reason. But finally they gave in, and we were able to cut out a small garden in the prison. The soil in the courtyard was dry and rocky. In order to start my garden, I had to remove a great many rocks to allow the plant room to grow. The authorities supplied me with seeds. At first, I planned tomatoes and onions, because these plants did not require rich earth or constant care. The early harvests were poor, but they soon improved. I began to order books on gardening. I studied different gardening techniques and types of fertilizers . For a time, I tried to grow peanuts, and used different soils and fertilizers, but finally I gave up. It was one of my few failures. A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could control. The processes of planting a seed, watching it grow, taking care of it and then harvesting it offered a simple but long-lasting satisfaction.

Question: Which of the following is true? Context: The English language is different from any other language. Yet English words do not stay the same. The language is always changing. We need new words for new inventions and new ideas. Different words come into use, or older words are used in a new way. English can change by borrowing words from other languages. Tomato was borrowed from Mexico and pajamas from Indian. The word coffee came from Turkey, and tea came from China. Now new space and science words are being borrowed from other countries, too. New words are also made by adding two words together. Strawberry, popcorn, and grandfather are words made up of two parts. Sometimes new words are shorter forms of older words. The word photo was made from photograph by cutting off the end of the longer word. Plane was made by cutting off the front part of airplane. Smog was made by using only the first two and last two letters from the words smoke and fog. The names of people and products can become new words. Our sandwich was named after a man named Sandwich.

Context: A survey shows that the number of fires in government buildings each year is small compared to home fires. This is probably because such buildings are taken good care of and managed. However, at home after work fire safety is your own duty. For most of us who live in high-rise buildings, the safety of you and your family depends on how much you know to do with an emergency . When a fire happens, there is usually little time to decide what to do or how to act. The best thing is to make your emergency plan as soon as possible.

Fire and smoke can move very quickly and the situations in any part of the building may change very quickly. Smoke is usually more dangerous than fire. It can spread throughout the building and enter your house when the fire is many floors away. Some information says it is best to leave your house immediately when there is a fire. Others say it is safer to stay there. Which is correct? Usually the best thing to do is to leave the building as soon as possible. However, do not try to leave your house a long time after the fire alarm has sounded. There is a higher chance that heavy smoke has already spread into stairways and hallways. Never travel through smoke. You must stay inside your house and place wet towels at the bottom of the door to stop smoke from entering.

Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Context: This March, the H7N9 virus hit Zhejiang, Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and so on. It seemed that most people who were infected with H7N9 had the common flu. Some people suffered from a fever or a cough. Don't be afraid---it's not easy to be infected with the virus. Here is some advice to help you protect yourself when it comes. Wash your hands. You need to wash your hands with soap and hot water before you eat, after you use the toilet , and after you touch animals, because your hands may carry viruses. Cover your nose and mouth, when someone sneezes or coughs, flu viruses can travel as far as one meter through the air, so you'd better stand a proper distance while talking to someone who has a cold. And always cover your nose and mouth with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough, and then clean your hands. Wear a mask . Some doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 80%, but if you don't wash your hands often, it's no use wearing a mask. And it's necessary to wear a mask in the groups of people. Do sports often. Exercise will help your body strong enough to _ the virus. </s>	You should cover your mouth and nose with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough. </s>
"Question: What is the best title for the passage? Context: If you're not a fan of KFC's famous Double Down hot dog, don't worry! KFC in the UK is developing a new treat: an edible coffee cup. The product is still in the trial stage and not yet available for purchase, but according to a KFC news report, the treat is made from a unique biscuit, wrapped in sugar paper, and lined with a layer of heat-resistant white chocolate, which helps keep the coffee hot. As you drink the coffee in the cup, the white chocolate lining will begin to melt slowly, and the biscuit begins to soften. But it doesn't end there --- the cups are not only edible, they also have a pleasant smell. KFC partnered with The Robin Collective, an experimental food company, to make the cups with coconut sun cream, freshly cut grass and wild flowers scents. According to the news report, that's because the scents arouse the positive memories we associate with warm weather, sunshine and summer holidays. Sounds ... delicious? A manager at KFC said, ""We have been experimenting with the edible packaging in limited quantities to see if it could be a popular product in the market. We believe if our customers occasionally like to have their cake and eat it, why wouldn't they want to have their cup and eat it instead!

"Question: What did the writer expect to do after he retired? Context: Being the head of a high school for many years, I grew tired of budget meetings, funding cuts, and many other administrative chores . I started to dream of retirement. Sitting in traffic on a weekday morning, I would find my mind wandering. I would imagine spending time with my grandchildren, quiet evenings with my wife, traveling, or rediscovering some great books. I told myself that I wouldn't sign myself up for any committees, any classes, or anything requiring a schedule. My first day of retirement came at last! I cooked a great breakfast for my wife and me, leisurely read the paper, cleaned a bit of the house, and wrote a few letters to friends. On the second day, I cooked breakfast, read the paper... On the third day, ... This is retirement? I tried to tell myself that it was just the transition , that those golden moments were right round the corner, and that I would enjoy them soon enough. But something was missing. A former colleague asked a favor. A group of students was going to Jamaica to work with children in the poorest neighborhoods. Would I interrupt my newfound ""happiness"" and return to the students, just this once? One trip. That's all. My bags were packed and by the door. The trip was very inspiring. I was moved not only by the poverty I saw but also by the sense of responsibility of the young people on the trip. When I returned home, I offered to work one day a week with a local youth organization. The experience was so positive that I was soon volunteering nearly full-time, working with students across North America to assist them in their voluntary work. Now, it seems, . Some days I am the teacher, other days I am the student. These young people have reawakened my commitment to social justice issues by challenging me to learn more about the situation in the world today, where people are still poor and suffer because of greed, corruption and war. Most important, they have given me the opportunity to continue to participate in helping to find solutions. In return, I help them do their charitable projects overseas.

Question: What's some experts' opinion about Japanese school rules? Context: Japanese students work very hard but many are very unhappy. They feel great pressure from their parents to do well in school and in college. Most students are always being told by their parents to study harder so that they can have successful future. Although this may be good advice for those who are very bright, it can have very bad results for many students who are not quick enough at learning. Unfortunately, a number of students actually kill themselves. Others are after comfort in using drugs. Some students, however, do bad things with groups of bad people and turn to crime. Many of them have tried very hard at school but, in spite of all their tries, have failed in certain examinations and have disappointed their parents. Such students feel that they are less important than everyone else they meet and leave school before they finish their study. It is surprising that although most Japanese parents are anxious for their children to do well at school, they do not help them in any way. Many parents feel that they are unable to help their children with their lessons and that it is the teachers' job to help their children. To make matter worse, a lot of parents send their children to special schools called juku-cram schools. These schools are open during the evenings and on weekends, and their only purpose is to prepare students to pass exams; they do not try to educate students in any real sense of the world. Thus comes a shock to realize that almost three quarters of the junior high school students attend these cram schools. Ordinary Japanese schools usually have rules about everything from the length of students' hair to their clothes and things in their school bags. Child psychologists now think that such strict rules often lead to a feeling of being unsafe and being unable to fit into society. They believe that no sense of moral values is developed and that students are given neither guidance nor training in becoming good citizens. </s>	They are bad for the development of each student. </s>
Question: From the text we can see that _ . Context: John Wesley Powell(1834--1902)Was a famous explorer of the American West.When he Was young,his mother put him under the guidance of George Crookham,a self-taught scientist,from whom he received a wide,but informal,education.Young John learned many things about the natural sciences.But his father preferred him to study religion.The argument continued for three years.Then John decided to leave home to seek further education.He soon discovered that he knew more about science than any teacher he met.He realized that the only good scientific education in the country came from colleges in the east,like Harvard and Yale.But he Was too poor to go to them,SO he got work as a school teacher in Illinois.Whenever possible,he went on scientific trips of his own. In 1861,civil war broke out in the United States.John joined the Union forces of the North.At the battle of Shiloh Powell lost his right arm.Despite his disability, he began his famous exploration of the Colorado River on May 24 1869. It Was one of the greatest trips of discovery in the history of America.Never before had any white men traveled to that area.The trip Was far more dangerous than expected.The rivers were filled with rocky areas and waterfalls.Sometimes,the boats overturned or broke into pieces against big rocks.All along the way, Powell measured distances,temperatures,heights,depths and currents.He examined soils,rocks and plant life.Powell'S explorations led to the creation of US Geological Survey, which became responsible for all mapping and scientific programs of American lands. Powell's scientific studies of western lands shaped his ideas of how those lands should be used.He suggested programs to control both crop farming and cattle raising.He Was especially concerned about water supplies.Many of his ideas were rejected at first and were not signed into law until years after his death because they were far ahead of his time. </s>	Powell'S explorations caused the creation of US Geological Survey </s>
Question: The author's attitude towards cloning is _ . Context: The Food and Drug Administration is, again, threatening to impose milk and meat from cloned animals on a public that opposes the technology and its products. Respected polls report that more than 60% of Americans think animal cloning is immoral, and that most people said they wouldn't knowingly eat the products even if the FDA approved them. But because the FDA would allow cloned meat and milk to be sold without identifying labels, consumers wouldn't be able to avoid them. The FDA has consistently tilted toward those who want cloned milk and meat in our food. Agency officials have repeatedly asserted that science shows cloned milk and meat are safe for humans. But the FDA has never published the complete scientific studies it says support that claim. The argument that cloning is safe for animals is unconvincing. Cloned meat and milk offer no public economic benefits. Having cloned cows produce more milk wouldn't reduce milk prices. prefix = st1 /USfarmers produce more milk than we drink, and the government is required to buy the surplus. Since 2000, dairy support programs have cost taxpayers more than $ 5 billion. Most important, this first decision to advance animal biotechnology raises ethical issues beyond the FDA's expertise. Techniques used to clone animals will advance the ability to clone humans-and create animals with human genes. Neither the agency nor animal scientists are qualified to tell us whether and when it is ethically acceptable for humans to alter the essential nature of animals. We need a national discussion, including ethicists and religious leaders, to consider the wisdom of cloned and transgenic animals. Given the risk of unintended consequences, we should proceed cautiously. The president should halt further FDA action on cloning and set in motion a process for beginning this broader discussion. </s>	opposed </s>
"Question: What can we infer from the text? Context: ""If you have not played video games, your childhood should be called 'incomplete'."" That's from Zhan Zaozao, 29, the screenwriter of Play to Grow Up, a 40-minute short movie. It tells the story of two men growing up fans of video games and how they find happiness in games. While people think playing games makes one lazy and is a waste of time, Zhan tries to prove that one can make a living out of it. In the movie, the two heroes, Dunzi and Yanjing, who are in middle school, visit a video games room on the street each day after school. But why make a short movie about video games, since there are lots to write about childhood, such as puppy love, sports and study? ""Playing games is so important to everyone's childhood from little kids to teenagers, though it's a bittersweet experience,"" said Zhan. According to him, his teachers and parents didn't allow video games, but they played games ""under their noses "" anyway. In the movie, the two playmates follow different paths after school.

"Question: How do people usually think of anger? Context: Anger is a natural emotion that everyone experiences in life. Some researchers believe the first sound a baby makes when born could be a sign of anger. Anger may be the original or first emotion we feel and respond to. Imagine, before hunger, thirst, love, desire or any other describable feeling, we may experience anger. Not only is anger a natural emotion, it is in many cases a perfectly healthy emotion. Anger can motivate people to make very positive changes in their lives. Anger can motivate individuals to do positive and memorable acts. Sometimes we have to be angry at injustice, at evil, or even at nature, before we can do what needs to be done to correct wrongs or make things better. But of course, that is not how we usually think of anger. Most people think of anger as an emotion we must keep under control. Children are sometimes sent to their rooms or punished for expressing anger in an excessive way. Parents tell a child to ""get control"" of himself when the child shows anger. We may be angry with friends or at work, but we know it is usually inappropriate to show it. We have to control the anger or suffer what may be the negative consequences. Very early in life, we learn that anger is something that must be controlleD.We learn this for a good reason. We know that uncontrolled anger can lead to fights, car accidents, bad relationships with others, unacceptable social behavior, and many other problems. Many experts say that if one holds his anger in, it can even lead to severe mental and physical health problems. So what can we do to understand and calm this natural emotion that we call anger? Experts offer many solutions to excessive and harmful anger. Some of these solutions include talking about what triggers the anger with someone you trust and is a good friend, leaving a situation that causes anger, beating on a pillow, exercising more in one's daily life, therapy, medication, and many other methods. Whatever solution one chooses, it is good to know that by trying to find the solution to the problem of anger, the first step in the right direction to solving the anger problem has been taken. </s>"	We should control it. </s>

Question: Where does this text probably come from ? Context: The production of coffee beans is a huge, profitable business, but, unfortunately, full-sun production is taking over the industry and bringing about a lot of damage. The change in how coffee is grown from shade-grown production to full-sun production endangers the very existence of, certain animals and birds, and even disturbs the world's ecological balance. On a local level, the damage of the forest required by full-sun fields affects the area's birds and animals. The shade of the forest trees provides a home for birds and other special that depend on the trees' flowers and fruits. Full-sun coffee growers destroy this forest home. As a result, many special are quickly dying out. On a more global level, the destruction of the rainforest for full-sun coffee fields also threatens human life. Medical research often makes use of the forests' plant and animal life, and the destruction of such species could prevent researchers from finding cures for certain diseases. In addition, new coffee-growing techniques are poisoning the water locally, and eventually the world's groundwater. Both locally and globally, the continued spread of full-sun coffee plantations could mean the destruction of the rainforest ecology. The loss of shade trees is already causing a slight change in the world's climate, and studies show that loss of oxygen-giving trees also leads to air pollution and global warming. Moreover, the new growing techniques are contributing to acidic soil conditions. It is obvious that the way much coffee is grown affects many aspects many aspects of life, from the local environment to the global ecology. But consumers do have a choice. They can purchase shade-grown coffee whenever possible, although at a higher cost. The future health of the planet and mankind is surely worth more than an inexpensive cup of coffee. </s>	An agricultural magazine. </s>
"Question: No bicycle lanes have been painted yet because _ . Context: Some people think that they have an answer to the problems of automobile crowding and pollution in large cities. Their answer is the bicycle, or bike. In a great many cities, hundreds of people ride bicycles to work every day. In New York City, some bike riders have even formed a group called ""Bike for a Better City"". They claim that if more people rode bicycles to work there would be fewer _ in the downtown section of the city and therefore less dirty air from car engines. For several years this group has been trying to get city government to help bicycle riders. For example, they want the city to paint special lanes--for bicycles only--on some of the main streets, because when bicycle riders must use the same lanes as cars, there may be accidents. ""Bike for a Better City"" feels that if there were special lanes, more people would use bikes. But no bicycle lanes have been painted yet. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea. Taxi drivers don't like the idea--they say it will slow traffic. Some store owners on the main streets don't like the idea--they say that if there is less traffic, they will have less business. And most people live too far from downtown to travel by bike. The city government has not yet decided what to do. It wants to keep everyone happy. On weekends, Central Park--the largest open place in New York--is closed to cars, and the roads may be used by bicycles only. But ""Bike for a Better City"" says that this is not enough and keeps fighting to get bicycle lanes downtown. Until that happens, the safest place to bicycle may be in the park. </s>"	the idea isn't accepted by all </s>

""I've realized I want to be around people who make me happy,"" she wrote, ""I've been seeing how I feel after communicating with different people and making a mental list of who I feel good about. And you're on my list."" Then she invited me -- and 11 other women-- to a ""Movie Night"" to be held every six weeks at her house. We'd chat, eat, and watch feel-good movies. She made it clear in her invitation that there was no stress to show up to all or any movie nights. Wonderful! I e-mailed her back immediately. I was in. Later, Jennifer told me she had some puzzled reactions to her invitation. Though all the women were willing to join, some said they didn't see themselves as cheerful people. ""I've told them they didn't have to be cheerful around me all the time. I invited them because they made me feel happy,"" she says. Research shows that gatherings such as Jennifer's _ . In a US study, researchers measured the happiness of 4739 people at regular intervals over 20 years. The study found that a person's happiness depends on the happiness of people they connect with. Amazingly, it also found that happiness spreads not only between direct friends, but also among friends of your friends' friends! And those good feelings seem to be the most contagious among friends of the same sex.

Question: What would be the best title for the passage? Context: Clean water is not only important for food production, but necessary for our life. However, large numbers of people in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are going without. The World Health Organization reports that almost 4,000 children die each day for dirty water or lack of water. Agriculture is the primary user of water at 70-85% of fresh water in the world. Industrial uses of water don't often come to mind, but you may be surprised to know that industry uses 59% of the water supply in developed countries. Home use takes up only 8% in the world. But as cities grow, the local government has to cut down on water use. Many cities are turning to privatization of water as a method of controlling use. The poor are paying as much as a quarter of their monthly income for water in some developing countries. In 60% of large European cities, groundwater is being used at a faster rate. People are saving water by simply using less and being careful with what they do use. Sometimes it's as simple as not throwing out water that they could use elsewhere. In Australia overuse of water has always been a problem. The Australian government has encouraged households and industries to collect rainwater and reuse water from showers. Technology is helping householders for shower and bath water for reuse in toilets or gardens. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a water saving program designed to encourage families and businesses to examine their water use and save more water.

Context: If the child has been brought up in a loving, openly communicative environment, the relationship with parents would be a strong one.It is only when there are ongoing troubles in the relationship between parents and the child that there is a breakdown in communication. When parents are going through difficulties in their own relationship the child sometimes develops guilt.The child can hold himself or herself responsible for the breakdown in relationship between the parents.This needs to be explained to the child, who won't speak out this guilt. The teenage years are emotionally sensitive years to the outside world.For the first time the child realizes his or her position in society.Friends suddenly become more important than parents.It is during this time that the relationship between children and parents is tested.If the bond with parents is strong, the child will not be swayed by the drug and alcohol culture.If the bond is weaker, the child will end up with problems. During such times, one of the effective ways to deal with the problems is to discuss the problem with the child.As parents, you will need to discuss the consequences of each option and then leave the final decision to the child.Forcing parental will on children is counterproductive, especially at this age.Imposing parental will at this time will stop communicating and then you will not know what is happening in their life.Whatever the problem is, the child need never be made to feel lonely.The moment that happens, the possibility of serious self-harm is raised. Any problem at this age can be dealt with by a flexible approach by parents.Discuss things calmly.Leave the decision to the individual.Make yourself available for any help or support that the child desires.The child will feel comfortable when allowed the freedom of choice. </s>	a weak bond with parents. </s>

"Question: Bees do a kind of dance to _ . Context: People have always wanted to speak with animals. There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them. Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited. People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people. Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL). Others tried with a simple computer. But chimpanzees could only learn to use a few words. They could never learn to use grammar. Their brains are very different from the brains of human beings. Now some scientists are studying the same points between human and animal language. In fact, some animals use sounds like people do. Dogs, for example, use an unpleasant, low sound to tell other dogs to stay away. People, too, use that kind of voice to say the same things. A dog's noisy bark communicate that something is happening. People use the same high tone when they shout, ""Watch out!"" Scientists want to understand the language of other animals, such as whales and bears. To do this, they go out to the animals' natural homes. They watch the animals for days or even years. They take pictures and make tape recordings and share the information with other scientists. In this way, they hope to learn more about the way animals communicate, and maybe someday we'll be able to communicate better with them. </s>"	tell other bees where food is </s>
Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements about Fred Stevens is TRUE? Context: Native American sand paintings are a very beautiful and popular art form for collectors today. But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s. A trader, Rex Bollin, recommended Fred to sell sand paintings since they were so beautiful. After working out how to make the sand stick to the canvas , Fred began selling his sand paintings. </s>	He was the first man to sell sand paintings in the world. </s>

"Question: What was Estee Lauder's father's attitude towards her when she tried her products on her female relatives? Context: In fine department stores everywhere, you'll see the light-blue boxes of Estee Lauder. These popular cosmetics are sold in more than 130 countries. Who's the woman behind this worldwide cosmetics empire ? Estee Lauder herself, of course. This businesswoman became, for a time, the world's richest self-made woman. Her secret? ""I didn't get there by dreaming about it,"" she would say. ""I got there by doing it."" Estee was born in the early 1900s in Queens, New York. Her father ran a hardware store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products. So Estee ""by accident"" dropped a bottle of youth dew on the floor in the cosmetics department. As the _ spread around the store, customers came over and asked to buy it. The store soon began selling Estee's products. Estee led her company until 1982, when her son Leonard took over the business. Until her health worsened in the mid-1990s, she continued to attend the opening of a new store wherever in the world. She died on April 24, 2004.

"Question: What makes drip irrigation seem increasingly important? Context: Daniel Hillel developed drip irrigation techniques. The techniques make farming possible in places where there is not enough water. Because of this, he won this year's World Food Prize. Hillel is using the techniques in his orchards near his home in Israel. Irrigating drop by drop -- called drip irrigation -- has changed agriculture by greatly reducing the amount of water needed. Farmers now rely on it in places from Spain, to Africa, to America. ""We in California grow about 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables of the continental United States,"" says Jan Hopmans from University of California at Davis. ""And these drip irrigation techniques make it possible."" Hillel got his start in dry land farming in Israel's Negev Desert in the 1950s. ""The key was making good use of water,"" he says. ""There's much land. Water is limited."" These farmers did not have the advantage of running irrigation water through channels to their crops. So Hillel and others gave plants just what they needed and just where they needed it. ""The idea is to use water little by little,"" Hillel says. It worked so well that Hillel was soon traveling around the world, showing others how to do it. Experts say drip irrigation's importance is growing, as climate change and rising population make water supplies become few in many parts of the world. ""This is where water use, climate change and crop production all meet at one point,"" Hillel says. ""And this has been really the essence of my career.""

Question: According to the passage, human death is now mainly caused by _ . Context: What will people die of 100 years from now? If you think that is a simple question, you have not been paying attention to the revolution that is taking place in bio-technology . With the help of new medicine, the human body will last a very long time. Death will come mainly from accidents, murder and war. Today's leading killers, such as heart diseases, cancer, and aging itself, will become distant memory. In discussion of technological changes, the Internet gets most of the attention these days. But the change in medicine can be the real technological event of our times. How long can humans live? Human brains were known to decide the final death. Cells are the basic units of all living things, and until recently, scientists were sure that the life of cells could not go much beyond 120 years because the basic materials of cells, such as those of brain cells, would not last forever. But the upper limits will be broken by new medicine. Sometime between 2050 and 2100, medicine will have advanced to the point at which every 10 years or so, people will be able to take medicine to repair their organs . The medicine, made up of the basic building materials of life, will build new brain cells, heart cells, and so on---in much the same way our bodies make new skin cells to take the place of old ones. It is exciting to imagine that the advance in technology may be changing the most basic conditional human existence, but many technical problems still must be cleared up on the way to this wonderful future. </s>	diseases and aging </s>
"Question: According to the author, what may chiefly be responsible for the moral decline of Japanese society? Context: Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don't know where they should go next. The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of teenagers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japans rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than their counterparts did in the ten other countries surveyed. While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression."" Those things that do not show up in the test scores, personality, ability, courage or humanity are completely ignored,"" says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's education committee."" Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild."" Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World WarII had weakened the ""Japanese morality of respect for parents."" But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles."" In Japan,"" says educator Yoko Muro, ""it's never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can endure."" With economic growth becoming centralization, fully 76 percent of Japans, 119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of isolated, two generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly one-quarter. </s>"	The life-style has been influenced by Western values. </s>

Two years after the couple got married, Ellen saw a huge change in the life of one of her students, a 9 - year - old girl. Three years earlier both of the little girl's parents had died and there was no one to take care of her. She was taken away to live in a government office. But finally she was taken in and adopted by a family and became their daughter. Ellen said that she noticed the difference in the child's life after she was placed in a permanent home and thought that maybe she and her husband could help a child in a similar way. They decided to become temporary parents and to take a child into their home just on the weekends when the real parents could not take care of him or her. The pair planned to have their own children in a few years, but decided that this would be a way to give to the community in the meantime. The couple quickly grew to love one of the children they looked after. When he became legally available, Billy became the first child they took in permanently. Six months after adopting Billy, Ellen was told by her doctor that she was unable to have children naturally. Ellen says she knew then that adoption was the way she was meant to have a family. Since adopting Billy, now 17, Ellen and Bill have adopted five more children -- Rose, 16; Albert, 11; Joshua, 5 and in June 2003, they added biological brother and sister Tyler and Rylee to the County family.

This is one of the rare things I love in my life, in addition to cycling. Like tennis, I find that I'm able to ride for ever and ever.

C. to Salt Lake City, Latin music sales are _ Wilson says there are two major reasons for the increase. One is simply the Hispanic population's increase in specific areas, which encourages stores to carry Latin product for the first time. Second, and perhaps more important, is the fact that major companies--whether dealing in music or not--are addressing the Latin consumer at a corporate level, creating Latin departments and hiring Latin ad agencies. One of Handleman's suburban Detroitstores, for example, has expanded its Latin section four times in the last two years. Cities like Milwaukee andDes Moinesare now stocking Latin product. Besides, it also results from economic development. It goes something like this: More often than not, a city or country with a seeming important Hispanic population will suddenly expand its construction or offer affordable housing to those working in larger, neighboring cities. This attracts lower-income workers, many of whom are Latin. Small shops and groceries begin to stock a small selection of music. When the Latin population numbers reach a critical mass, the local mass merchant, if there is one, begins stocking the product. Sooner or later, a local radio station follows; first AM, then FM. Sometimes it's a cable TV show or a small TV station. Of course, there are other driving forces that should not be forgotten, for example, regional Mexican music. </s>	The driving forces of regional Mexican music </s>

"Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true? Context: Many people like the feeling of the gentle wind in spring . Many like to see the falling leaves dancing in the wind in autumn. But sometimes, when the wind becomes a storm, it can be very destructive. A series of such storms struck the US last month and caused very serious damage and human pain. Every year, major storms cause many problems around the world. There is nothing people can do to stop these powerful forces of nature. But new techniques are helping scientists to predict how, when, and where big storms will happen. The more exact scientists' warnings are, the better people can prepare for the storms. Predictions are improving. ""We've gotten better over the years, especially the last few years,"" says Phil Klotzback, a scientist at an American university. How is a storm formed? Even if scientists know where a storm will happen, winds can suddenly change, carrying the storm to a new direction. ""For a hurricane to happen, conditions have to be just right,"" Klotzback says. First, the ocean water needs to be warm enough so that it evaporates and rises into the air. As it rises, the vapor cools and turns back into liquid. This process gives off heat. This produces energy like an engine that causes winds to increase. It drives the formation of a hurricane. If wind speeds reach 40 miles per hour, the system is called a ""tropical storm"", and it gets a name. At 75 miles per hour, it becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes that hit the US start when a thunderstorm forms off the coast of Africa. Storms also develop over tropical waters in other parts of the world. On average, 60 or 70 storms form off Africa every year. About 10 of them get names. There are usually about six hurricanes. Two tend to be very big, with winds of 115 miles per hour or higher. The hurricane season lasts from June to November. Ninety percent of all hurricanes hit in August, September, and October. </s>"	Every year at least 60 storms form off Africa. </s>
"Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Context: Throughout his early years, Obama was known at home and at school as ""Barry"". Obama's parents met while both were attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was enrolled as a foreign student. They separated when he was two years old and later divorced . His father received Master's degree in Economics from Harvard University, then returned to Kenya, where he became a finance minister before dying in an automobile accident in 1982. His mother married another foreign student, Lolo Soetoro, and the family moved to Soetoro's home country of Indonesia in 1967. Obama attended local schools in Jakarta, from age 6 to 10, where classes were taught in the Indonesian language. During his time in Indonesia, he first attended St. Francis Assist Catholic school for almost three years. When Obama was in third grade he wrote an essay saying that he wanted to be president. His teacher later said that his reason for becoming president was that he wanted to make everybody happy. Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his materal grandparents while attending Punahou School, a private college elementary school, from the fifth grade until his graduation in 1979. Obama's mother, Ann, died of cancer a few months after the publication of his 1995 memoir , Dreams from My Father. In the memoir, Obama describes his experiences growing up in his mother's middle class family. Of his early childhood, Obama writes, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me---that he was black as pitch , my mother white as milk .""

"Question: What do you know about the 10cyber games ? Context: China's Ministry of Culture has recommended 10 cyber games that are suitable for minors to play as part of its drive to purify the on-line environment for the young. The 10 cyber games were selected by the ministry's on-line games censorship committee from scores of games recommended by the Chinese public.l The games are all domestic products. They include five role playing games (RPG), four recreation and chess games, and one educational game, such as ""Warring States II Online,"" ""Rainbow Island Online,"" and ""Wonderlands of learning and games."" These games have made their way into the final recommendation list because they are considered ""healthy"" and can ""enhance intelligence,"" according to the ministry. The ministry hoped the list could serve a a guidance for parents to better direct their children in the winter vacation, which usually lasts nearly two months from January to February each year. This was the third time for the ministry to publish recommended cyber games list. The previous two were made public respectively in January 2006 and August 2005 with a total of 25 games inlisted. In the past few years, on- line games have become the favorite pastime of young people. However, it is argued that such social problems as game addiction, juvenile delinquency and perversion among minors by on-line violence and pornography have come from an inadequately regulated Internet. About 9.72 percent of Chinese netizens between the ages of 13 and 30 suffer Internet addiction, said a report issued last month by the China Youth Association for Network Development (CYAND). According to the China Internet Network Information Center (CINIC), the main Internet watchdog, China had 210million Internet users at the end of 2007 and its online population is on course to become the world's largest at the beginning of this year. Net users between 18 and 30 accounted for 49.9percent of the total users. Although the CINIC did not give the figure of those below 18, teenagers and youths have obviously taken up more than half of the total number of net users.

"Question: What's the main idea of the passage? Context: WHAT sets Spain apart from the rest of Europe? It might be ""siestas"", the three-hour lunch break that is customary in the country. The Spanish start work at 8 or 9 am, but in the early afternoon they usually take a three-hour break. After lunch, people can be seen napping in cars or on benches. During hot summer afternoons, Spanish village streets are often totally deserted . When they return to their offices at 4 pm, Spanish workers often have to make up for the lost time by working until 8 or 9 pm. So, while most other Europeans are sound asleep, Spaniards are still having dinner or watching television. ""Everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment,"" described AP. ""This work schedule is a Spanish cultural vice,"" said Nuria Chinchilla, head of the International Center on Work and Family at the University of Navarra in Barcelona. ""Changing to the European schedule should be the most urgent project for the government."" Many Spanish people complain about their never-ending workdays, and some even think the issue has affected the country's development. ""In Spain we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,"" lawmakers in the Spanish parliament wrote in a proposal. ""This has a negative effect on productivity, stress, accidents and school dropout rates."" That's why, last September, they recommended that Under the proposed newuthe government turn back the clocks by one hour. schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. And a regular eight-hour workday would be introduced. However, some doubt that changing the time zone would reverse low productivity, which comes more from the country's service-oriented economy , according to Maria Angeles Durant, a sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council. But Ignacio Buqueras, the president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that ""changing the Spanish schedule would allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economy."" The Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously, but it hasn't taken any action yet, reported The New York Times. Spain's siesta is not actually a product of its relaxed Mediterranean culture. At the start of the 20th century, Spain had the same working hours as many parts of Europe. It was during World War II that the country moved the clocks forward to align them with those of Nazi Germany. The same thing happened in Portugal.

"Question: All the toys that the teacher showed _ . Context: A teacher showed three toys to his students and asked them to find out the differences. All the three toys seemed to have the same shape, size and material. After looking at them carefully, the students discovered holes in the toys. The first toy had holes in the ears. The second toy had holes in its ear and mouth. The third toy had only one hole in one of its ears. Then the teacher put a needle in one ear hole of the first toy. The needle came out of the other ear. For the second toy, when the needle was put in its ear , it came out of its mouth. And for the third toy, when the needle was put in, it did not come out.

Question: What is the main purpose of the author in writing the passage? Context: The advantages of using flashcards to build up a vocabulary are well known. You can buy sets of cards, or make your own, and carry them with you wherever you go. There's no question this is useful and because you can use them in short bursts, it's not too much for you. It can be fun. I don't recommend drilling for hours at a time with flashcards. If you want to use flashcard software, things get even better. There are many packages out there for maintaining and drilling flashcards. I recommend VTrain though there are many others. One stands out, however: SuperMemo. Similar to Pimsleur, SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick. When you look at a card, you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it. It uses this information, and that of your previous attempts, to decide when you will be shown the card next. It's smart and it really works. If you're like me, the news is even better! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone. Wherever I am, if I have my phone handy, I have thousands of flashcards with me too. Honestly, it would be worth purchasing a cheap Palm device only for this. You can pick one up for $20 or even less on eBay or elsewhere.

Question: From the text we can learn that GPS bullets _ . Context: It's illegal for the police to attach a GPS unit to your car without your permission, as the U.S. Supreme Court settled in 2012.But if the police are in hot pursuit of a bank robber or other escaping criminals that threaten public safety, a GPS tracker is acceptable. But exactly how can the police GPS track a car that is moving fast? The answer to that question comes from StarChase,a new police technology being used by a small but growing number of law enforcement agencies.It allows the police to fire 4.5-inch glue-covered GPS bullet-like projectiles from an air gun fixed in their police cars.If the GPS tracker makes contact with the escaping robber's car, it'll stick no matter how fast the vehicle is going.That way, the police will have a constant read on the car's location and heading.Aside from simply apprehending criminals,it's believed this new technology could help save lives.If the police successfully fire a GPS unit at a speeding criminal,they can pull back from a high-risk chase.Chases can be incredibly dangerous to all involved,including innocent bystanders and other drivers.Once the GPS bullet connects,there's no need for the chase any longer. Now,predictably,a GPS-loaded gun isn't cheap. Police departments need to pay about $5.000 per vehicle for the technology,and individual GPS bullets cost as much as $250 each.That may sound expensive,but remember:The alternative is often thousands of dollars in property damage,and great human cost in injury and lost life.According to Star Chase,their GPS bullet system has an apprehension rate of 80%without any report of inury or property damage.If you'd like to learn more about the StarChase system,Popular Mechanics has just published a good article about it.There's also plenty more information available at the company's website. </s>	are useful for the police </s>
"Question: Psychologically speaking, the reason why some youngsters commit crimes is that _ . Context: The days of the sneak thief who stole a couple of apples or a packet of sweets from a chain store are actually over. I had a chance to say this to a young offender the other day, ""Sweets from a chain store?"" He said, ""You must be joking. That's what kids do."" I may add that he was aged 11. In other words, today's young criminals would find it laughable to risk being caught for petty theft of this description. They've got enough money in their pockets to buy the sweets they want, anyway. I think it's all too easy to put the blame on anyone but ourselves. Faced as they are with a society that frequently gives them up on the grounds of color1, race or low learning ability, these children turn to crime as a means of showing off their self-respect. Nurtured on films and TV glamorizing the role of the criminal, they are quick to copy these anti-heroes. It is a matter of increasing concern to the police and government that the Children and Young Persons Act, 1969, is becoming improper to deal with the rise in young criminals. Because the emphasis has been placed on the cause and gentle treatment of their crimes, rather than on old-fashioned methods of punishment, the children themselves know well that there is very little that can be done to prevent them continuing to steal, damage and in some case even cause the death of those they choose to terrorize . I don't like the look of this situation any more than you do. In our own interests and in those of our children and grandchildren, we cannot continue to take the ""it's nothing to do with me"" attitude we have used for so long.

From that day on, the man hid all his valuables in the cave, and to avoid anyone suspecting he was rich, he gave up his job, his home, and his friends. He constantly watched the approaches to his cave, wanting no one to find out about it. Fearing thieves, he guarded the cave all night long. He was so devoted to the cave that he hardly ate or drank. Before long, he fell ill. Many days passed, and he got thinner and sicker, losing all his strength. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he realized that it was his greed that had brought him to this extreme end. He understood that guarding his treasure had been of no use and no good. He decided to share it with others. He crawled into the cave to fetch some jewels, but discovered that the cave was almost empty. All he could find was a small emerald . He took it and left the cave, intending to give it to the first person passing by. Soon a woman approached and accepted the emerald with great joy. The man said to her, ""I could have given you many more riches, but I don't know where they went. This is all I have now."" ""Are you sure there's nothing else?"" replied the woman. The man shook his head and pointed to the cave. He found that some riches were still there; he saw some gold coins. He said, ""Take them with you."" The woman took both the emerald and the coins, and went away happily. In a while, an old man passed by and asked the man what he was doing there. The man replied, ""What bad luck! Just a moment ago I gave a woman the few riches left over from the treasure I was guarding."" ""Are you sure there's nothing else?"" The old man asked him. The man showed him the cave, and they found a box filled with jewels and gold. The man was shocked. The old man explained to him, ""At last! At last someone has freed himself from the spell of this cave. You see, this is a magic cave, and you're the first to pass its great test. Many people have devoted their lives to this cave, only to end up realizing there's nothing here ..."" ""And why does this happen?"" said the man. ""Why does the treasure appear and disappear?"" ""My son, this magic cave has as many riches as does your own heart. When someone discovers it, the cave fills with the treasure they bring with them, but later, when they all devote themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts begin emptying, and so does the cave. The only way to fill it is to fill your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving that last jewel to the woman. That's the reason why the cave was filling up again ..."" And so, the man understood it was better to share than to keep things to himself. And, from that day, thanks to the cave and the old man, the man became ever more noble and generous. </s>"	He became more generous. </s>

"Question: According to the author, which one belongs to the real economy? Context: I want to talk about the economy.Not ""the economy"" we hear about endlessly in the news each day and in politicians' speeches.I want to talk about the real economy, the one we live in day by day. Most people aren't particularly interested in ""the economy"".""Share prices are flying high; interest rates are soaring; the Dow Jones Index closed sixty-three points down on 8472.35."" We hear this and subconsciously switch off. Notice that ""the economy"" is not the same as the economy, ""The economy"" is what men in suits play with to make vast personal wealth.The economy is where the rest of us live on a daily basis, earning our living, paying our taxes, and purchasing the necessities of life. We are supposed to be benefiting from all the advantages of a well-off society.So why do we feel tired and stressed? We have no time for anything other than work, which is ridiculous given the number of labor-saving devices in our lives.Our towns become more and more crowded.We poison our air and seas, and our food is full of chemicals.There's something wrong here.If times were truly good, then you may think we'd all feel optimistic about the future.Yet the majority of us are deeply worried.More than 90 percent of us think we are too concerned about ourselves and not concerned enough about future generations. The term ""economic expansion"" suggests something desirable, but expansion simply means spending more money.More spending doesn't mean that life is getting better.We all know it often means the opposite - greed, crime, poverty, pollution.More spending merely feeds our whole economic system, which is based on production and consumption.Unless money keeps circulating, the economy breaks down.If we don't keep consuming, the whole system goes into stalemate . How do we break the cycle and make some changes? We need to become far more aware of the results of our actions.We buy clothes that are made in sweat shops by virtual slaves in poor parts of the world.We create mountains of waste.We demand cheap food, mindless of the fact that it totally lacks taste and is produced using chemicals that poison the land. The consumption culture makes us unaware of the effect of our own behavior.Our main problem is not that we don't know what to do about it.It is gathering the desire to do it. </s>"	Shopping in a supermarket </s>
"Question: Which of the following can improve the Sino-Japan relations? Context: China and Japan are respectively the world's secondandthirdlargest economies. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009. The relationship between China and Japan has been _ at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge itswartimepast to the satisfaction of China. China joined other Asian countries, such asSouth Korea,North KoreaandSingapore, in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whitenJapanese war crimesinWorld War II. They claimed that the rise ofmilitarismbecame evident in Japanese politics. Muchanti-Japanese emotion has risen, because of the increasing feelings ofChinese nationalismand former Prime MinisterJunichiro Koizumi's visits to theYasukuni Shrine . Although Koizumi openly declared---in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in Jakarta--- ""deep regret"" overJapan's wartime crimes, many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not consistent with the action. Sino-Japan relations changed slightly after Shinzo Abebecame thePrime Minister of Japanin September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward new agreement on the issue ofWorld War II-era violent action. However, there also remains the dispute over the Diaoyu Islands, which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and violence across Mainland China, from BeijingtoShanghai, laterGuangzhou,ShenzhenandShenyang. In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week. The incidents set off the largest-scale anti-Japanese protests in China for decades in which protesters vandalized Japanese shops and cars. On the 14th of September relations worsened even further in response to Japan's announcement of plans to buy the island from its private owners. The news resulted in the Chinese government sending six surveillance ships to the islands and further anti-Japanese protests in which protesters attacked the Japanese embassies in Shanghai and Beijing. </s>"	Reaching an agreement on their disputes. </s>

"Question: Why do scientists think deltas near the lake may hold secrets about past life on Mars? Context: US researchers have found traces of an ancient lake on Mars recently, increasing hopes of discovering evidence that billions of years ago the Red planet hosted life. The lake, which dates back some 3.4 billion years, appears to have covered as much as 80 square miles and was up to 1,500 feet deep, said the team from the University of Colorado. ""This is the first clear evidence of shorelines on the surface of Mars,"" said Boulder's research associate, Gaetano Di Achille, in a study published in the latest edition of Geophysical Research Letters. ""The identification of the shorelines and accompanying geological evidence allows us to calculate the size and volume of the lake, which appears to have formed about 3.4 billion years ago.""[:] Analysis of the images has shown the water carved out the canyon in which it was found, which then opened out into a valley depositing sediment which formed a delta . ""Finding shorelines is a great discovery to us,"" said assistant professor Brian Hynek, adding it showed the lake existed at a time when Mars was thought to have been cold and dry. Scientists believe the oldest surfaces on Mars formed during the wet and warm era known as the Noachan epoch, about 4.1 billion to 3.7 billion years ago. The newly discovered lake is believed to date from the Hesperian era and postdates the end of the warm and wet period on Mars by 300 million years, according to the study. Scientists believe deltas next to the lake may well hold secrets about past life on Mars as such places on Earth have become the natural deposits of organic carbon and other markers of life. </s>"	Because similar places on Earth have become natural deposits of markers of life. </s>

Question: What was Jan doing when the building was on fire? Context: Jan was a window cleaner. One morning, Jan was in a lift of a high building with his window cleaning tools when the building was on fire. There were five other passengers in the lift. All of a sudden the lift stopped. Although they didn't know what had happened outside, they had only 100 minutes to get out of the building before it would fall into the dust. Soon smoke began coming into the lift. The men knew that something was wrong. They tried to open the door but found a wall in front of them. The wall had the number 15 on it and they knew they were on the 15th floor. But their lift usually didn't stop there, so there was no opening for them to escape. Jan decided they would have to make their own. Knowing that the wall was made of a material that could be cut through, Jan took out his window cleaning tools, and began knocking a hole through the wall. When he felt tired, others helped. Starting with one small hole, they cut through the three-inch-thick wall. Then they kicked hard at the wall. The wall cracked apart. They saw before them a tile wall! Refusing to give up, they knocked a hole through the tile, then made the opening big enough to get through. Surprisingly, the fire-fighters were outside the hole, they took Jan and his partners to the nearest stairs and they ran down the stairs as quickly as possible.

"Question: According to the passage, we know that _ . Context: Drinking a lot of water does not do any good to the body, according to two experts in the United States. In fact, they warn, drinking too much water could be, in certain cases, harmful. In a study, Dr Stanly Goldfarb and Dr Dan Negoianu, both of the Renal, Electrolyte and Hypertension Division at the University of Pensylvania, the United States, have denied the popular belief that drinking a lot of water clears body toxins better, improves skin, and helps reduce weight. Dr Goldfarb and Dr Negoianu say that they found little proof to back the public opinion that drinking 8 glasses of water every day benefits health. At the same time, they fond little proof of harm in drinking 8 glasses of water every day. It is widely believed that in some cases-such as athletes, people who live in hot, dry environments, and those with certain medical conditions-drinking a lot of water indeed helps, but no studies have been done to prove the benefits of this practice in average, healthy people, the website medheadlines.com reports. The study at the University of Pennsylvania also examined reports that some people experienced increased headaches when their consumption of water was low. In one small study, which the doctors reviewed, the group drinking the most water reported fewer headaches than the control group, ""but the difference in the number of headaches was o small between the two groups as to be considered unimportant."" The researchers concluded that there is no scientific proof to support that average, healthy people need to drink at least 8 glasses of water each each day. The website medheadines.com says that, according to an Indian doctor, drinking too much water is harmful.

"Question: Slow food's characteristic doesn't lie in _ . Context: In 1986,when Carlo Petrini first coined the term ""Slow Food,"" he organized locally in his native Italy to preserve the food and wine culture and protest fast food. Today, slow food has spread to 132 countries with over 85, 000 members, addressing worldwide issues like farmer equity and _ --the actions people take to respect the rights of all living things and all environments, to contribute to healthy and livable communities. Characterized by Slow Food International as ""good, clean, and fair food,"" slow food must enrich the eaters' life,have no negative impact on human or environmental health,and compensate fairly for food producers' work.

However,cost for food travel and heavy processing are not the only problems in the food industry that the environment faces. Industrial agriculture also has unsustainable practices like inefficient water use and decreased biodiversity. Our ideas in feeding ourselves are exceptional, but at various points our technologies come into conflict with nature's ways of doing things. A great many of the health and environmental problems created by our food system owe to our attempts to oversimplify natures complexities, at both the growing and the eating ends of our food chain.

Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Context: Before we send humans into deep space, we'll have to find out just how long the human body can survive in a weightless environment. One problem is that in space there's no physical sensation to let you know when you're upside down and astronauts have to rely on possible clues from their surroundings. A few hours after reaching orbit , one in three of all astronauts will experience space sickness--a feeling rather like carsickness. There is also the problem of protection from the extreme hazards of space such as constant meteorite bombardment and radiation. It is going to take some clever technology to keep rockets and astronauts from these dangers. Even with a well-protected spaceship, space travel isn't going to be easy. No matter what you travel in, it is going to be a long flight in space! Science fiction writers often imagine using suspended animation , a kind of forced long-term sleep, as a way for astronauts to escape the boredom of long missions. An even stronger measure might be to freeze the astronauts. We already use cryogenic techniques to preserve dead bodies and store human embryos . Freezing living adults may not be so far away, but perhaps we don't have to do that. Perhaps we should use our existing technology and send frozen embryos to the far corners of universe. Hundreds of years from now, billions and billions of miles away, the embryos will be thawed and their hearts will start beating. These astronauts of the future will not grow inside a mother's body but will be produced in a machine. They will be brought up by robot. It may seem strange but one day it might just happen. </s>	cryogenic techniques will practically be used for space flight in hundreds of years </s>
"Question: Which of the following can't get a green card? Context: The creation of a Chinese Green Card in 2004 was a milestone in the country's immigration law. Five years on, the card is an increasingly sought-after document. On August 15, 2004, the Regulations on Examination and Approval of Permanent Residence oAliens in China created a Green Card system granting qualified foreigners the right to live in China permanently. Liu Lili, who works in the Exit and Entry Administration of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, has watched the Green Card system develop since its inception. She said nearly all applications received by the Bureau are approved. So far, 323 people have been granted a ""Green Card"" qualifying them for permanent residence in Beijing. Another 15 are awaiting final approval. It takes around 6 months to process each application. Of the 323 Green Card holders, 94 are wives or husbands of Chinese citizens; 50 are minors dependent on their parents; 20 are senior citizens returning to live with relatives; 114 are individuals who have made outstanding contributions or are of special importance to China (another 7 are their family members); and 23 are high-level foreign personnel who hold posts in businesses (another 15 are their family members). Liu said the authorities had been granting residence to returning senior citizens for some time before the Green Card system was formally launched .The government has approved permanent residence for over 3,000 foreigners since the implementation of the Law on Control of the Entry and Exit of Aliens which was adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in November 1985. Four groups of people are eligible for permanent residence: high-level foreign personnel who hold posts in businesses that promote China's economic, scientific and technological development or social progress; foreign citizens who make large direct investments in China; persons who have made outstanding contributions or are of special importance to China; and people who come to China to be with family, such as husbands and wives, minors dependent on their parents, and senior citizens dependent on their relatives. Liu said that most applications she dealt with were from American citizens. Why do overseas citizens apply for permanent residence status in China? The main concern, aid Liu, is the political factor. Once people have a ""Green Card"", they feel they are accepted and trusted by the Chinese government. The ""Green Card"" also facilitates entry and exit. With permanent residence status, visas are no longer needed and people can enter and leave the country using only a valid passport. China offers outstanding career opportunities and is seen by many as safer and more secure than many other countries, said Liu. Liu said that Green Card holders have the same rights and responsibilities as Chinese citizens. However the card is not equivalent to Chinese nationality and holders are not allowed to vote in elections, hold political office, or serve in the military. Obtaining a Green Card is not easy. The qualifying conditions are tough. Unless you are a close relative of a Chinese citizen,you will either have to invest a substantial amount of money in the country or make a genuinely outstanding contribution to the country's development. To meet increasing demand, he authorities are considering making the Green Card more available by broadening the range of applicants without lowering the requirements, aid Liu, but she gave no further details. </s>"	A foreigner who works in China for a long time. </s>
"Question: In the mind of very young children, the Internet is _ . Context: As digital technology increasingly controls the lives of young people, scientists have begun to wonder: Is the Internet good or bad for kids? ""It's impossible to answer that question because the Internet is so many things,"" says psychologist Patricia Greenfield. ""It's networked computer games and news about politics and instant messaging and e-mails to your grandmother. It can be both an educational resource and a hiding place for kidnappers."" Adults have many reasons to worry about kids' Internet use. In chat rooms, for instance, it is easy to lie and kids can get trapped in dangerous situations. In searching for and visiting websites, kids can come across words and pictures that they may not be prepared for. To help prevent that situation, in 2000, the US Congress passed the Children's Internet Protection Act, which requires schools to block offensive and obscene websites. Researches have pointed out how confusing the Internet can be for children, even when they think they know how it works. To find out how much kids know about the technology, Zheng Yan, an educational professor in New York, interviews over 300 students in grades four to eight. Most of the youngest students think the Internet is simply an icon on the screen. It often isn't until 10 that kids realize that the Internet is a network of millions of computers. It takes another 2 or 3 years for them to understand that a stranger can see what they've posted. Understanding the technology helps kids understand how dangerous the web can be. It's not simply enough to block harmful websites or to limit the number of hours kids spend online. Learning about the Internet can also give young people the power to use it in beneficial ways. </s>"	simple </s>

All you know is that things will be different and chances are you won't know the kids at your new school. The experiences that go with moving make many kids feel nervous and worried. This is perfectly normal but don't let these emotions overrun your thoughts! You will soon get used to your surroundings and find new friends at your new school. Leaving old friends and familiar places behind can be difficult. However,as you begin the moving process,keep in mind that saying goodbye to your old house,school,and friends does not mean that you have to forget them or that your farewell is permanent!If you're moving to a new state or even a different country and won't see your friends for a long time,don't despair. Make sure to ask everyone for their address so you can write them letters. Also,thanks to the Internet,it is very easy to stay in touch through email or instant messaging technologies. With your parent's permission,you can even create a blog or web page to chronicle all of your new experiences. Include your thoughts,tales of your new adventures,even pictures of new friends,your new house,and new town. Your old friends will love seeing what you are busy with. Many schools have an orientation program where a student already established at the school shows a new student around for their first week. This can help you to find your way around the school and to make new friends faster. While moving is tough on kids of any age,high school counselor Karen Turner says moves can be particularly difficult for teens .""I think moving during adolescents is an extremely stressful experience,especially if you are into your junior high or senior year. Students tend to have established a very strong peer network during that period in their lives. Often this has more influence on them even than their families in some cases,and when they are torn from that there's often resentment .""However,Turner adds that while moving isn't easy,there are things that your parents and the school can do to help you deal with the change. </s>"	teens can easily be attached to their friends </s>

Context: I was an extremely verbal child, and growing up with my dad was an experiment in linguistics . My father was a man of few words. Whenever I wanted his permission for a certain activity, I planned a speech that included who would be there, where it would take place, how long it would last, and why it was an incredibly wonderful opportunity for me. He would listen and then say either ""Yes"" or ""No."" There were never any qualifiers; not ""Yes, but be home by dinner"" or ""No, unless you can convince me otherwise."" It was yes or no, plain and simple. My father's phone messages were also lessons in patience and long-suffering to a teenage girl. I was quite active in high school. Not only did I enjoy being involved in many areas, but I came into contact with many a great teenage guy. I can recall one busy day when I had met two great guys and had given each of them my phone number. The first words out of my mouth when I walked through the front door were, ""Dad! Did anyone call?"" His answer, of course, was simply ""Yes"".I required for a more accurate description of the caller. His answer: ""A boy."" Since I had met two guys that day, this did not help me. I ran to my room in tears. Knowing my dad's dislike of language in general and his fondness for briefness, it surprised me to hear that he was going to teach the eleven-year-old boys' Sunday school class.

"Question: The author supports his ideas mainly by _ . Context: It's rare that you see the words ""shyness"" and ""leader"" in the same sentence. After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few ""innies"". Unlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard. Being shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they ""own"" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image. Shyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements. As a result, they are able to acknowledge mistakes, imperfections, knowledge gaps and limitations. Since shy people have a lower sensitivity to outside rewards than outgoing ones, they're more comfortable working with little information and sticking to their inner desires. Shy people are also more likely to insist on finding solutions that aren't primarily apparent. Don't believe me? Maybe you'll believe Albert Einstein, who once said, "" _ "" Obviously, finding certainty where uncertainty is typically popular is a huge plus for any successful person. The myth that shy people are less effective leaders than their outgoing fellows is just a misunderstanding.

In the West Bank and Gaza , the mood was overexcited as hundreds of Palestinians welcomed the prisoners back home, after many had spent more than 20 years behind bars.

"Question: What can we infer from William's words? Context: After numerous warnings over the years, you thought coffee probably had a negative effect on your health. Perhaps the drink is not so bad after all. The new study, conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has been published and suggests that coffee does not have a harmful effect on your health. Researchers suggest, based on data examined, older adults who drink a lot of coffee, have a lower risk of death when compared to their non-drinking coffee peers. The team of researchers conducting the study analyzed data on 400,000 U. S. men and women,aged 50 to 71 years; the individuals had participated in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. This study started in 1995-1996 and was tracked until the day a participant passed away, or Dec. 31, 2008. According to a press release on the report, researchers shared that coffee drinkers are ""less likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections, although the relationship was not seen for cancer."" Results indicated participants that drank three or more cups of coffee a day reduced their risk of death by 10 percent. Based on the findings that both caffeinated and non-caffeinated coffee found similar results, researchers are thinking caffeine is not the protective ingredient , although which ingredient in coffee might be, they are not sure. Researchers indicate that despite these observational findings, they caution it is not clear whether or not drinking coffee actually extends life expectancy. ""Coffee is one of the most widely drunk drinks in America, but the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of death has been unclear. We found coffee consumption to be associated with lower risk of death overall, and of death from a number of different causes,"" said Neal Freedman, Ph. D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI. ""Although we cannot infer a relationship between coffee drinking and lower risk of death, we believe these results do provide some comfort that coffee drinking does not adversely affect health,"" Freedman said.

"Question: Is there scientific evidence to support eating too much is the cause of a ""weight problem""? Context: In the United States, 30 percent of the adult population has a ""weight problem."". To many people, the cause is clear: We eat too much. But scientific evidence does little to support this idea. Going back to the America of 1910, we find that people were slimmer than today, yet they ate more food. In those days people worked harder physically, walked more, used machines much less, and didn't watch television. Several modern studies, moreover, have shown that fatter people don't eat more on average than thinner people. In fact, some investigations (researches), such as a 1970 study of 3,545 London office workers, report that, on balance, fat people eat less than slimmer people. Studies show that slim people are more active than fat people. A study by a research group at Stanford University School of Medicine found the following interesting facts. The more the men ran, the greater loss of body fat. The more they ran, the greater their increase in food intake . Thus those who ran the most ate the most, yet lost greatest amount of body fat. </s>"	There is hardly any scientific evidence to support this. </s>

Question: Packaging is important to producers because _ . Context: To get a chocolate out of a box requires a lot of unpacking: the box has to be taken out of the paper bag in which it arrived, the cellophane wrapper has to be tom off, the lid opened and the paper removed, the chocolate itself then has to be unwrapped from its own piece of paper: But _ . It is now becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything that is not done up in beautiful wrapping. The package itself is of no interest to the shopper, who usually throws it away immediately. Useless wrapping accounts for much of the refuse put out by the average London house-hold each week So why is it done? Some of it, like the cellophane on meat, is necessary, but most of the rest is simply competitive selling. This is absurd.Packaging is using up valuable energy and resources and polluting the environment. Recycling is already happening with milk bottles which are returned to the dairies , washed out, and refilled. But both glass and paper are being threatened by the growing use of plastic. More dairies are experimenting with plastic bottles. The trouble with plastic is that it does not rot Some environmentalists argue that the only solution to the problem of ever increasing plastic containers is to throw away plastic altogether in the shops, a suggestion unacceptable to many producers who say there is no alternative to their handy plastic packs. It is evident that more research is needed into the recovery and re-use of various materials and into the cost of collecting and recycling containers rather than producing new ones. Unnecessary packaging, intended to be used just once, and make things look better so more people will buy them, is clearly becoming increasingly absurd But it is.not so much a question of throwing away packaging as using it wisely.What is needed now is a more advanced approach to using scarce resources for what is, after all, a ly unimportant function. </s>	they want to attract more shoppers </s>

"Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Context: Millions of British people have _ the traditional ""thank you"" and took the place of it with the less formal ""cheers"", according to a survey. Although the common person will say ""thank you"" nearly 5,000 times a year, one in three are more likely to add a ""cheers"" or ""ta"" where it's needed to show they are fashionable. One in twenty now say ""nice one"" instead, while the younger are more likely to offer a ""cool"" than a ""thank you"". ""Merci"", ""fab"" and even ""gracias"" were also listed as common phrases to use, as ""much appreciated "". One in twenty who took part in the survey of 2,000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day, which is marked on November 24, 2011, said a formal ""thank you"" was now not often needed in everyday conversation. More than one in ten adults said they regularly won't say thank you if they are in a bad mood. Most people stated that saying thank you was something that their parents trained them. A huge 70 percent of those questioned will say thank you to a person's face without even meaning it, while one fifth avoid saying it when they know they should. It seems our friends and family get the stress of our bad manners. Half of them admit they're not good at thanking those closest to them. Many of them explain that they don't say thank you because their family ""already know I'm grateful"". When spoken words won't do, it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people. One third will still send a handwritten thank-you note---but 45 percent admit it's been more than six months since they tried to send one. A quarter of British people say ""thank you"" with food, with 23 percent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone. Another 15 percent bake a cake. It follows that 85 percent of people will be angry because of not getting the gratitude they feel they should receive. </s>"	Many people think it unnecessary to say thanks to their family members. </s>
"Question: The passage mainly tells us _ . Context: American author Mark Twain once noted that ""life would be surely happier if we could only be born at the age of 80 and gradually approach 18."" Twain's words were only one of many complaints about aging. The ancient Greek poet Homer called old age ""hateful"", and William Shakespeare termed it ""terrible winter"". Alexander the Great, who conquered most of the known world before he died around 323 B.C., may have been looking for a river that healed the of age. During the 12th century A.D., a king called Prester John ruled a land that had a river of gold and a fountain of youth. But the name linked most closely to the search for a fountain of youth is 16th-century Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. He thought it would be found in Florida. In St. Augustine, the oldest city in the U.S., there's a tourist attraction. It is said to be the fountain of youth that Ponce de Leon discovered soon after he arrived in what is now Florida in 1513. However, elderly visitors who drink the spring's water don't turn into teenagers. But the tale of the search for a fountain of youth is so appealing that it survives anyway, says Ryan K. Smith, a professor of history. ""People are more attracted by the story of looking and not finding than they are by the idea that the fountain might be out there somewhere."" Still, a few grains of truth have helped to support . Kathleen Deagan, a professor of archaeology, says a graveyard and the remains of a Spanish mission dating back to St. Augustine's founding in 1565 have been discovered near the so-called fountain of youth. Michelle Reyna, a spokesperson for the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park in St. Augustine, says the fountain has been a tourist attraction since at least 1901 and may have been attracting visitors since 1860. </s>"	whether the fountain of youth exists </s>

"Question: The word ""boss"" in old German means "" _ "". Context: There are some stories behind English words. You've spent a lot of time studying how to use English in a proper way. But have you ever wondered why English speakers say some of the things they say? For example, why do they say ""an easy task"" is ""a piece of cake""? Why do the two letters ""OK"" means ""all right""? Many English words and phrases have stories behind them. Sometimes these stories can help us look back into old western history. Let's take a look at a few of the original * common English words and phrases: OK ""OK"" was an American who lived in the 19th century. His name was ""Old Kinderhook"". In one year he was trying to take the place of the leader of his town. His supporters went around the town shouting "" OK \ OK \"" The supporters thought their future leader was "" all right"". The expression caught on, and now if something is ""all right"" , people like to say ""OK|"" Boss* Is your boss nice to you? If not, just be glad you weren't living in the old times. Back to that time, bosses could do anything bad to their men and could even beat* them! That explains why the word ""boss"" comes from an old German word meaning ""to beat"". A piece of cake A famous American writer named Ogden Nash lived in the 1930s. Many readers enjoyed his poems and wrote them down in their notebooks. In one of his poems, Nash wrote, "" Her picture's in the papers now, and life's a piece of cake. "" His readers found these words interesting and quickly wrote them down. They thought that if one picture in a newspaper could make you famous, wouldn't life be easy? For nearly 70 years, ""a piece of cake"" has meant any task or activity that is easy. </s>"	to beat </s>
Question: Which of the following supports the writer's opinion? Context: As a foreigner,I don' t know the situation in the US well. Seeing all kinds of recent shooting incidents,I think it should be controlled more strictly than now. Somebody said that the person who has it in mind to kill another can do it without a gun,so the causes of murders are not guns but the trend of despising life in the US. And they also insist that there is no clear evidence that the increasing number of murders is connected with possession of guns,so the personal rights should not be restricted by the reason that there is not enough evidence. Several months ago,I agreed with that partly. But as we know,the private groups like NRA have used the public opinion and persuaded the government to protect their profit. Other weapons such as knives,razors ,bats are made for their own usage. But guns are made for only one reason--to kill someone. Of course,there are people who have guns to protect themselves from the criminals. But crime is getting more cruel and severe nowadays,so actually even if someone has a gun,it is impossible to guard himself completely. As a substitute ,I think,if the possession of guns is controlled more strictly,people can live safer lives than now. There are other reasons to oppose the gun control (e.g.the possession of guns is historical inheritance and represents that people's resistance will be against tyrannical government),but none of them can justify and explain today's serious situation in the US. </s>	People can live a safer life without guns. </s>
"Question: France introduced high speed trains to _ . Context: It is commonly known that Japan went from a 19th century national economy to a 20th century global economy in a time span of 30 years between 1945 and 1975. What is less known is that Japan, understanding that fast, efficient transport was the key to a global economy, was the first country in the world to introduce the ""Bullet Train"". Kawasaki Heavy Industries was duly appointed the manufacturer and the first high speed train went ""on line"" in 1964. The Shinkansen, as is known in Japan, made its first journey between her capital and Osaka, a distance of 301 miles, at a speed of 132 mph. The next country to introduce high speed trains was France. SNGF, the public rail system in France, was losing passengers to other forms of transport and introduced the ""TGV"" (Train a Grande Vitesse) to counteract the trend in 1981. As a result of Opec controlling the oil market in 1974, the train was designed to be powered by gas turbines. It ran on a specially built track between Lyon and Paris. Eight years later another TGV was introduced, this time between the coast and Paris. Soon, France became the most rail efficient country in the world with high speed train connections to Belgium, London, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands. There was another positive element that resulted from the introduction of high speed trains. Between 1964 and 1991, Japan's Shinkansen had transported in excess of three billion passengers without there being a single fatal accident and eleven years after France introduced the TGV, it still had a 100% safety record. This statistic has never been equaled by the traditional slow moving trains in any country. China has become the fourth country to produce such trains, after France, Germany and Japan. China's first domestically produced bullet train with a maximum speed of 350 kilometers per hour has rolled off the production line. Equipped with highly-efficient power system, the currently fastest train in China is also energy efficient. When the train is running, it can transfer kinetic energy into electricity, so that it can ensure its electricity supply even when it is cut off from the power grids. In all, such trains are expected to be in commercial operation by the end of 2010. </s>"	increase the number of passengers </s>

Question: Parents in prison agreed to film checking because _ . Context: The use of the word imitation reminds me that we ought to make some more comments on the risk of people imitating what they see on the screen in the way of crime or violence. First there was always a risk of children acting out scenes which could be dangerous. For example, I remember a woman who was head of a middle school telling me that she had happened to look out of her window when the children were on the playground and had seen them putting a small boy on a chair with a rope round his neck and the rope over the branch of a tree; fortunately she was in time to get there before the child was hanged. I remember a film in particular in which the hero who was imprisoned had escaped by electrocuting his guard, the technique of doing this being shown in detail. This was the kind of scene which we could cut for these reasons. In films for young people and adults we always tried to keep off the screen the details of criminal techniques, such as how to open a locked door with a piece of hard plastic or how to open a safe; if we were consulted before production, I used to advise that the details should not be shown. When I gave talks in prisons about film checking I had full support for this, since fathers who were in prison for criminal offences did not want their children to get on crime. Every time I gave a talk in a prison someone used to mention the French film Rififi. made by Jules Dassin in 1954. This remarkable film showed in great detail a robbery of a jeweler's shop, the robbery lasting about half an hour and being backed by only natural sound...one of the most brilliant film sequences of all time. I remember our discussion at the time. We thought that the robbery was finished only with the use of advanced and obviously expensive equipment and that only the most experienced and skilled criminals could possibly imitate it; we believed therefore that it was ly safe. When talking in prisons some years later I learned that there had been several robberies in which the techniques had been copied, so perhaps we were wrong. </s>	they did not want their children to follow them </s>

Question: According to the writer, most fashion designers are _ . Context: It took me more than 10 years to realize that the world has no shortage of fashion designers who have the ability to make trendy and elegant garments, but that it is badly in need of, simply, clothes designers. My own definitions would set fashion and clothing greatly apart. It is a fact that, in the shopping malls, there are plenty of beautiful garments whose unpredictability makes our life color1ful and interesting. You are almost convinced: You can buy whatever you dare to think. There is no doubt that fashion designers are usually with high qualifications. They study fashion trends, select color1s, and make sure the final production of their designs is done properly. However, as experience grew with age, my attraction to arts became ever stronger. I have a strong desire for clothing to stand as does paint to the painter, as does stone to the sculptor, as a simple and particular language of an individual creation, which draws the audience from an appreciation of the surface to deeper thoughts with the world of the soul. I believe that the most meaningful creative motives should arise through caring for other people, the great care of humanity--a concern for human feeling and spirituality. _ , but it is bigger than love, and it is unconditional. I believe the greatest works of art can touch the deepest and strongest parts of human feelings and the world of the spirit, and only these works can be the memories of history, preserving the most valuable feelings that have ever existed, and inspiring a greater awareness of ourselves. I am not satisfied if people only appreciate clothing if it merely satisfies their desire. I believe clothing could be a specific creative language for communicating ideas and thoughts, for inspiring you and shaping your behavior. Those clothes fashioned out of necessity possess a power that can continue to exist across the ages. This is what I have tried to achieve, the clothing to return to its original simplicity, the clothing to help people regain the natural sense. The true fashion today should not follow the trends. It should instead uncover the extraordinary in the ordinary, for I believe the pleasure you get from the clothing is not its price, but its spirit. </s>	trendy </s>

I walked home and immediately turned on the television and watched until my bedtime.

Question: Visual context may work when children get older than _ . Context: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle.

Question: This selection says that the work of removing stones _ . Context: In some parts of the United States, farming is easy. But farming has always been difficult in the northeastern corner of the country, which is called New England. New England has many trees and thin, rocky soil. Anyone who has wanted to start a new farm there has had to work very hard. The first job has been cutting down trees. The next job has been digging the stumps of the trees out of the soil. Then the farmer has had the difficult job of removing stones from his land. This work of removing stones never really ends, because every winter more stones appear. They come up through the thin soil from the rocks below. Farmers have to keep removing stones from the fields. Even today, farms which have been worked on for 200 years keep producing more stones. That is why stone walls are used instead of fences around New England fields. The stone walls are not high; a man can easily climb over them. But they keep the farmer's cows from joining his neighbor's cows. </s>	must be done again and again </s>
"Question: What could be the best title for the passage?_( ) Context: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship. Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey. Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India. The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs. The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost $ 150. In the second, $ 1,500. ""And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. "" Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to $ 1,500. ""Now the poor performed significantly worse. "" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night. The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year. ""So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest. The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after. And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers. ""They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when they were richer. "" Mr. Shafir says the results support 50 years of research that shows all humans have limited mental power to deal with things in life. ""And so the insight here is that, having not enough of something in a way makes it harder to make good decisions for everything else. "" </s>"	Poverty weakens brain power. </s>
"Question: According the passage, Cittaslow is a(n) _ . Context: Cittaslow has discovered China, and it is awarding a little village in Jiangsu the title of ""slow city"" The bored teenagers of Gaochun are impatient with the leisurely pace of hometown life.For them there is no nightlife to speak of, no bright lights, no excitement and they cannot wait to grow up and leave for the urban attractions of the big cities.But it is this laid-back lifestyle that has attracted international attention.At least, a quiet village within Gaochun county has come under the spotlight.Yaxi village, population 20,000, is about to be designated China's first ""slow city"" by Cittaslow, the sustainable lifestyle movement that first surfaced in Italy 11 years ago. At home, the residents at Yaxi are unfazed and pretty much unimpressed by the honor.To them, life has been like this for as long as they can remember.Here, growing old gracefully is natural. Nobody living in this little county had heard of Cittaslow or the words ""slow city"" before this. ""The first time I heard the term was last July, when the vice-president of Cittaslow, Angelo Vassallo, visited Yaxi village,"" says Zuo Niansheng, the chief editor of local newspaper Gaochun Today. ""Vassallo was deeply impressed by this village's natural and cultural resources and said it perfectly fitted the requirements for a slow city,"" says Zuo.""That was how Yaxi became connected with Cittaslow. The Slow City must also be committed to protect and maintain the natural environment as well as promote a sustainable way of development ?all of which are the current strategies adopted in Gaochun.""We've been doing this for years,"" adds Zuo. Cittaslow was founded in Tuscany, Italy in 1999.It was a spin-off from the Slow Food movement which started, also in Italy, in 1986 as a protest against the first McDonald ' s opening near the Spanish Steps in Rome.The movement championed a return to healthy, nutritious home-grown, home -cooked food. Slow Food has since expanded globally to more than 130 countries.Its mission has also broadened to include the promotion of sustainable foods and local small businesses, and the localization as opposed to globalization of food production. Cittaslow is an expansion of the Slow Food movement, and it actively advocates a lifestyle that is sustainable, that will improve quality of life, and will preserve cultural and culinary heritage. </s>"	organization </s>
"Question: In what way do top-level administrators from abroad contribute to university development? Context: When next year's crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they'll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost of Yale, who'll become Oxford's vice-chancellor----a position equal to university president in America. Hamilton isn't the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it's gone global. Yet the talent flow isn't universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from America. The chief reason is that American schools don't tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. ""We didn't do any global consideration,"" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board finally picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a particularlly American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity. Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators , and has hiring committees hungry for Americans. In the past few years, well-known schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen ""a major strengthening of Yale's financial position."" Of course, fund-raising isn't the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind to promote international programs and attract a global student body.

Question: According to the passage, we can infer that _ . Context: Elephants are the largest land animals and they need plenty of living space. They have seasonal migration routes. As human populations rise, elephant land is being cleared for agriculture and other kinds of development. When animals are effectively trapped on small areas of land, it restricts the gene pool and also results in a shortage of food. Where elephant reserves border agricultural areas, elephants are often attracted to leave parks to attack crops and barns. Only the strongest walls will stop an adult elephant (males can weigh 6,000kg), so farmers have great difficulty protecting their fields. In prefix = st1 /India, elephants don't only attack for food. Some even have developed a taste for rice beer. InAssam, elephant-human conflict has resulted in the death of more than 150 people and 200 elephants in the space of two years. Poverty leads to the killing of elephants for meat. If people don't have enough food and their governments cannot afford to enforce poaching bans, it's not difficult to predict the outcome. Ivory comes form elephant tusks , which can grow to be 3 meters long. Both male and female African elephants have large tusks. Most new ivory comes from Africa and is sold as a high status material in Asian countries such as Thailand, mainlandChinaandJapan. It can fetch $150 an pound and is carved to make decorations, chopsticks and ink stamps. The conservation priority here is to change public attitudes. In some countries in southern Africa, where conservation efforts have been successful, there is not enough room for a growing elephant population and animals have to be killed. A CITES meeting in November 2002 ruled that Botswana,NamibiaandSouth Africamay sell stock-piled ivory, starting in2004. Many conservationists are convinced that _ will fuel the demand for ivory and lead to more illegal poaching, they say it is almost impossible to tell legal from poached ivory. The governments argue that the sales will be used to fund conservation work. </s>	if the government could help solve poverty, there would be less killing of elephants. </s>
"Question: We can infer from the passage that Douglas is a _ boy. Context: On Thanksgiving Day, a teacher asked her class of firstgraders to draw a picture of something they were thankful for. She thought that these children from poor families actually had little to be thankful for. And she found most of them drawing pictures of flowers or tables with food. The teacher was very surprised to see the picture Douglas handed in. It's a hand,a simple hand. But whose hand? The class were very interested in the strange picture. ""I think it must be the hand of God that brings us food,"" said one child, ""A farmer's,"" said another, ""Because he grows beautiful flowers. "" Finally when the others were at work ,the teacher went over to Douglas' desk and asked whose hand it was. ""It's your hand, Teacher,"" he said quietly and shyly. She remembered that she had often taken Douglas, a dirty lonely child, by the hand while having a class break. She often did that with the children. But it meant so much to Douglas.

"Question: Which of the following is WRONG according to the passage? Context: If you exhibit positive characteristics such as honesty and helpfulness, the chances are that you will be thought as a good-looking person, for a new study has found that the perception of physical attractiveness is influenced by a person's personality. The study, which was led by Gary W.Lewandowski, has found that people who exhibit negative characteristics, such as unfairness and rudeness, appear to be less physically attractive to observers.In the study, the participants viewed photographs of opposite-sex individuals and rated them for attractiveness before and after being provided with information about their personalities. After personality information was received, participants also rated the probability of each individual' s becoming a friend and a dating partner.Information on personality was found to significantly change the probability, showing that cognitive processes modify judgments of attractiveness. ""Thinking a person as having a desirable personality makes the person more suitable in general as a close relationship partner of any kind,"" said Lewandowski. The findings show that a positive personality leads to greater expectation of becoming friends, which leads to greater expectation of becoming romantic partners and, finally, to being viewed as more physically attractive.The findings remained consistent regardless of how ""attractive"" the individual was formerly thought to be or of the participants' current relationship status. ""This research provides a positive outcome by reminding people that personality goes a long way toward determining your attractiveness; it can even change people's impressions of how good-looking you are,"" said Lewandowski. </s>"	The judgment of one's attractiveness always stays unchanged. </s>

"Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Context: Go to church, then have a big lunch, then go out to play while mum does the housework. That was a typical British Sunday in the 1960s. But things now could not be more different. Some British sociologists recently studied the typical British Sunday. They found that people get up later and do less housework than they did 40 years ago. They are far more likely to be out shopping or enjoying themselves than cooking Sunday lunch. Sunday mornings were busy 40 years ago. Most women caught up on their weekly housework and cooked a nice lunch. They seldom allowed themselves any ""leisure"" until afternoon, after the dishes were cleaned. Then there would be another rush to the table between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm for tea. But now, Britons can have brunch at the restaurant. Fewer people bother to cook themselves. ""You only have two free days a week. You don't want to have to waste one because there is nothing to do but watch boring TV,"" said Elizabeth Biggs, 25, a producer in London. ""On Saturday you are recovering from the week,"" Biggs added. ""Sundays are the last chance for the weekend -- you want to get as much as you can out of the day before you have to go back to work."" In the past, British women usually did their shopping during the week, while the husband was at work. ""Now men seem to do that as much as women,"" said Jonathan Gershuny, a professor who took part in the study. Men also do more housework now on Sundays.

"Question: The passage mainly discusses _ . Context: My favorite English teacher could draw humor out of the driest material. It wasn't forced on us either. He took Samuel Johnson's dictionary, Addison's essays, and many other literary wonders from the eighteenth century and made them _ , even at eight o'clock in the morning. The thing that amazed me most was that the first time I read these works on my own some of them seemed dead, but the second time, after his explanation, I couldn't believe that I hadn't seen the humor. The stories and poems and plays were suddenly filled with allusions and irony and hilarious moments. I learned more from him than from any other teacher. My least favorite English teacher also made people laugh. Some students found him to be funny. Many others did not. He assigned journals over a six week period, to be written every day. At the end of the six weeks I had a notebook full of bits and pieces about my ideas, short stories, reactions to what we had read, and so on. Our teacher announced that we would be grading each other's journals. Mine was passed to Joe, that class clown, who always behaved in a funny or silly way. He saw it fit to make joke of and said, "" This writing isn't fit to line the bottom of a birdcage. "" Our teacher laughed at that funny remark. It hurt me so much that the anger from it has driven my writing and teaching ever since. So what makes the difference? Humor is one of the most powerful tools teachers or writers have.

"Question: The example of the company Google is given to show that _ . Context: For many years, scientists have known that laughing is good for the health of our minds and bodies. Now we are learning that it's not just laughter. Having fun and playing are also good for us! Researchers have found that play is good for people of all ages. Play actually leads to the growth of more nerve connections in the brain and gives us more brain power. Play is necessary during childhood. As children play, they learn how to make friends and relate to others. They develop their imaginations and become more creative. Kids carry these qualities with them as they grow older. Amy Whitcomb teaches maths at a school in San Francisco. For several years, she has used games to teach maths. In one class, students play a game with small bags of candy to _ how many pieces in the bags are red. When they get the correct answer, they can eat the candy!

Question: The Appalachian Mountains _ . Context: One of the most popular activities enjoyed by Americans is spending time in forests and walking along paths through the country.This activity,called hiking,has led to the creation of paths throughout the United States. One of the longest is the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.The trail is the first completed part of the National Trails System.The trails system was established by Congress and the president in 1968.The Appalachian Trail is more than 3,400 kilometers long.It starts in the northeastern state of Maine and ends in the southeastern state of Georgia.The trail goes through 14 states.They are Maine,New Hampshire,Vermont,Massachusetts,Connecticut,New York,New Jersey,Pennsylvania,Maryland,West Virginia,Virginia,Tennessee,North Carolina,and Georgia. The path takes walkers through the Appalachian Mountains.They extend from the Canadian province of Quebec to the southern American state of Alabama. The Appalachian Mountains are among the oldest on Earth.They first began forming about one thousand million years ago.During the millions of years since then,the mountains were changed and reformed by the forces of water and wind.Ice also changed the mountains,making many of them smaller and digging valleys and lakes among them.Many different kinds of trees grow along the trail.And many different kinds of animals live in the forests along the trail. Lands along the trail are protected by the federal government and by state governments.Some parts are not protected by the government directly.Instead,they are protected by legal agreements with private owners willing to permit people to walk across their property. Walkers on the Appalachian Trail pass through some of the great valley systems of the mountains.They can look down into these beautiful valleys and see farms and forests stretching across the land for many kilometers.Farmland in the valleys is rich and productive.And some of the great events in American history took place in the valleys.For example,one of the great battles of the American Civil War was fought in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. </s>	were changed by natural forces like water,wind and ice </s>

"Question: As far as their eating habits are concerned, babies and rats are similar in that _ . Context: Animals seem to have the sense to eat when they are hungry and they do not eat more than their bodies need. It has been demonstrated that rats will, when given a choice over a period of time, prefer water with vitamins to water without vitamins even though there is no difference in taste or smell between the two water bottles. When a fragrant flavor was added to the vitamin-enriched water, the rats did seem to prefer it and kept drinking it ,even after the vitamins were switched to the clear water. In time, however, they broke _ and went back to where the necessary vitamins were. In a classic experiment, babies of 6 to 12 months old were placed in a cafeteria feeding arrangement, with a wide selection of baby food before them. They were given whatever food they pointed to or appeared interested in. We are told that at first they showed some unusual eating patterns, but that over a period of time they managed to select well-balanced diet. So, in selecting food, rats and babies do seem to know and act on what's best for them. Apparently, there is a kind of ""body wisdom"", which humans soon lose. Most of us do not eat as wisely as we could. Many of our food preferences are culturally determined and influenced by long-established habits.

But it has the clearest and cleanest air. Amazingly, in this place, the sun sometimes hangs even in the midnight sky. This place is Antarctica : the coldest, windiest and harshest place on the Earth. As the world's least-known place, Antarctica is of great interest to scientists around the world. In 1983, China joined the Antarctic Treaty (<<>> ). The treaty made Antarctica a peaceful place for member countries to do scientific research. During 30 years, China has sent many scientists to Antarctica. They mostly look at the resources under the icy land and do research about climate change and marine biology. Antarctica is a place with fantastic views. However, life there is very hard. Food is one of the biggest problems. Frozen food which can be heated easily is people's daily food. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, scientists often eat dried or canned vegetables. Sleep is also troublesome. In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this period, Antarctica points to the sun and receives sunlight 24 hours a day. In order to get some sleep, scientists cover the windows with black plastic cloth to create ""night"". Working in Antarctica is dangerous, especially when meeting gale-force winds.Sometimes the wind is even stronger than a typhoon.It can easily blow people away.So there are ropes that connect buildings of some research stations.People can hold these ropes to keep their balance in forceful winds. What's more, communicating with others is difficult. Without cables and Internet in some research stations, two-way radios are the only tools to communicate.

The smallest unexpected event can bring about conditions of complete chaos. The strange thing is not that people stand these conditions, but that they actually choose them in preference to anything else. Large modern cites are too big to control. People living there are forced by their environment to take a wholly unnatural way of life. They lost touch with the land and rhythm of nature. It is possible to live in such an air-conditioned existence in a large city that you can hardly tell the season. A few flowers in a public park may remind you that it is spring or summer. All the simple, good things of life like sunshine and fresh air are hard to find. Even the distinction between days and nights is lost. The funny thing about it all is that you pay dearly to live in a city. The demand for accommodation is so great that it is often impossible for ordinary people to buy a house of their own. The cost of living is also very high. Just about everything you buy is likely to be more expensive than it would be in the country. Besides, the crime rate in most cities is very high.

Doesn't it sound like the situation in the office?www.zxxk.com Here's a summary of some of the study's findings: Gum chewers showed a reduction in anxiety as compared to non-gum chewers by nearly 17 percent during mild stress and nearly 10 percent in appropriate stress. Gum chewers showed improvement in alertness over non-gum chewers by nearly 19 percent during mild stress and 8 percent in moderate stress. Improved Performance: Chewing gum resulted in a big improvement in overall performance on multi-tasking activities. Although these aren't major improvements, every little bit works and chewing a piece of gum is a lot quicker and easier than slipping outside for a 10-minute walk. So, how does gum work this magic? In part it does so by lowering the level of cortisol --a steroid hormone that is released in response to stress in your system. A few words of advice before you reach for the gum: don't crack your gum, and be sure to chew it with your mouth closed. In fact, I'd say keep the gum out of meetings, because it really looks impolite to others around you. </s>"	It works by reducing one's level of cortisol. </s>
"Question: Who helped the abbot out of his trouble? Context: There was once a rich old _ ) in England who lived a very rich life. When King John, who was the worst king that England ever had, heard of the way in which the abbot lived, he decided to stop it. So he sent for the old man and said, ""Your fault is clear, and unless you can answer me three questions within two weeks, your head shall be cut off, and all your money shall be mine. Firstly, you must tell me just how long I shall live. Secondly, you must tell me how long I shall ride round the whole world, and lastly, you shall tell me what I think."" The abbot went to Oxford and Cambridge for help but not one of the teachers in the great schools could. At last, sad and sorrowful, he rode towards home. Then he met his shepherd and told him all that had happened. ""Cheer up, good master. I think I can help you out of your trouble."" The shepherd dressed himself up with great care and looked just like the abbot. Then he went to the king. ""How long shall I live?"" ""You will live until the day that you die, and not one day longer."" ""How long shall I ride round the world?"" ""You must rise with the sun, and you must ride with the sun until it rises again the next morning. As soon as you do that, you will find that you have ridden round the world in twenty-four hours."" ""What do I think?"" ""You think that I am the abbot. But, to tell you the truth, I am only his poor shepherd, and I come to beg your pardon for him and for me."" The king laughed long. ""Very well then, you have won the old abbot a free pardon from King John for this joke."" </s>"	The abbot's shepherd. </s>
Question: What is TRUE about all human beings? Context: The social sciences, as the name shows, are the scientific study of the behavior of human beings, both in groups and individually. There is no past or present information of human beings who were not in groups. The groups may be small, like the family, or large, like a city or nation. But in order to reach complete development, man must be a member of a society. It is true that some individuals are more solitary than others. Some like monks or hermits may decide, for religious or other reasons, to leave their society and live alone. But these are unusual individuals, and even they cannot separate themselves completely from the rest of mankind. A society, then, seems to be the natural environment of mankind. Scholars who study mankind in social organizations are called social scientists. The human behavior which social scientists study is learned behavior. The behavior of the human body as a living organism is studied by the biologist, the biochemist, or the physician. This behavior of man's physical body is inherited through the genetic development of his species. For example, all physically normal and healthy humans learn to walk as their bodies grow and develop. Social scientists concern themselves with the behavior that man must learn so that he can take his place in a social group. In order to be a functioning member of that group, each member must learn to behave in a way acceptable according to the differences among societies. The social scientists are newcomers to academic studies. By the end of the 19th century, the natural sciences had developed a method, by which they were able to understand the physical world. By using the scientific method, chemists, physicists, and astronauts, for example, learned a great deal about the universe. It seemed reasonable to apply the same method to the study of man's social life. Through this kind of study man may learn to understand himself much better. The scientific method is a way of collecting facts in order to describe an existing situation as correctly and completely as possible. The description must consist only of what can be perceived , analyzed, measured and recorded. Feelings and personal opinions or ideas have no place in scientific description. The fact must be observed and described in such a way that another scientist could repeat the same study and get the same results. </s>	They are all members of groups. </s>

"Question: Olga Kotelko was well-known at the World Masters Athletics Championships because _ . Context: At the age of 95, Olga Kotelko attracted great attention at the World Masters Athletics Championships. This 5ft-tall Canadian became the oldest recorded woman indoor runner, high jumper and long jumper at the competition. Olga now has more than 30 world records to her name and has won more than 750 gold medals. But she sees herself as nothing special, describing herself as just a plain Jane. As one of 11 children brought up on a farm, she has always been active, milking cows and doing other housework. She has now outlived all her brothers and sisters and most of her friends but when asked what her secret is, she says there isn't one. ""I think your age is just a number. It's not your birthday; it's how you age that makes the difference. It's your attitude to all the things that happen in your life that plays the biggest part."" So can we all turn ourselves into nonagenarian superheroes? Research from Newcastle University suggests that as every 24 hours pass, we add an extra five hours to our lives -- that's over 2 months each year--partly because of improving living conditions and medical development. And in the UK the number of people who are living into their 100th year has nearly increased by four times since the 1980s. So ageing is not a terrible thing. While Olga's genes might help her, we're not all prisoners to our own. After all, 75% of our later lives could be down to the lifestyle we choose to lead. A good diet and regular exercise are key. Besides, developing friendships in mid-life also works. Dr Holland, director of Aston University's research centre for healthy ageing, says: ""The more friends you have when you're 50-60 years old, the less likely you're to be lonely in later life; the less lonely you are, the less likely you're to be ill as the years go by."" </s>"	she was the oldest sportswoman there </s>

Question: Which is the best title of the passage? Context: Many of us don't pay much attention to the importance of eye care. It is said that if you take care of your body, then you can surely be healthy. That is why our eyes should be given a lot of care. Natural eye care should be put in a number one place. There are several causes leading to poor eyesight like not enough food, genes and aging . Televisions, computers and reading are also the causes of having poor eyesight.

"Question: vAccording to the passage, hurricanes usually _ . Context: Many people like the feeling of the gentle wind in spring . Many like to see the falling leaves dancing in the wind in autumn. But sometimes, when the wind becomes a storm, it can be very destructive. A series of such storms struck the US last month and caused very serious damage and human pain. Every year, major storms cause many problems around the world. There is nothing people can do to stop these powerful forces of nature. But new techniques are helping scientists to predict how, when, and where big storms will happen. The more exact scientists' warnings are, the better people can prepare for the storms. Predictions are improving. ""We've gotten better over the years, especially the last few years,"" says Phil Klotzback, a scientist at an American university. How is a storm formed? Even if scientists know where a storm will happen, winds can suddenly change, carrying the storm to a new direction. ""For a hurricane to happen, conditions have to be just right,"" Klotzback says. First, the ocean water needs to be warm enough so that it evaporates and rises into the air. As it rises, the vapor cools and turns back into liquid. This process gives off heat. This produces energy like an engine that causes winds to increase. It drives the formation of a hurricane. If wind speeds reach 40 miles per hour, the system is called a ""tropical storm"", and it gets a name. At 75 miles per hour, it becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes that hit the US start when a thunderstorm forms off the coast of Africa. Storms also develop over tropical waters in other parts of the world. On average, 60 or 70 storms form off Africa every year. About 10 of them get names. There are usually about six hurricanes. Two tend to be very big, with winds of 115 miles per hour or higher. The hurricane season lasts from June to November. Ninety percent of all hurricanes hit in August, September, and October. </s>"	travel at 40 miles per hour and get its name </s>
Question: What might the novel Black Beauty be about?

Ellison, originally from Oklahoma worked hard to match his earlier success but felt that he could not make any progress on his next novel that eventually came to include well over 2000 pages. It was not until Ellison's death that this novel was condensed ,edited and published under the title Juneteenth. Writer: Margaret Mitchell Novel: Gone with the wind Margaret Mitchell, born in Georgia, never wanted to seek out literary success and wrote this expansive work in secret, only sending to publishers after she was mocked by a colleague who didn't believe she was capable of writing a novel.

One day Martha was hurt. She overheard her father telling her mother, ""All our children love me except Martha."" ""How can this be?"" Martha thought. ""Am I not the one killing myself in my work to have money to pay for his medicines? My brothers and sisters do not even provide their share in the expenses.""

Question: According to the passage, Chinese parents _ . Context: In America, parents tend to encourage their children to develop their potential to the fullest extent. Fathers and mothers frequently teach their children both ambition and the confidence necessary to work toward their goals. American parents are always active in concentrating on what their kids can do, not what they can't. As a result, millions of American boys and girls grow up hoping to become actors and athletes, diplomats and doctors. Many of them even want to become president. American parents often encourage their children to become involved in extra activities of all types at school, such as student government, sports and music. They believe that only through taking part in these activities can their children become mature young adults. As we all know, schoolwork is important. But parents should realize that the social skills their children learn form natural conversations with each other are as important as schoolwork and the skills they will need in the future work. What's more important in their work is that their children should have a sound knowledge of physics or the ability to communicate effectively. As a rule, Chinese parents don't educate their children about the same kind of ambition and confidence as Americans do, nor do they encourage the same level of participation in extra activities. Children are typically advised to study hard and pass exams. They have to spend a lot of time in doing much schoolwork every day. It is a great waste of time to do so. Now more and more Chinese parents have recognized that they should pay attention to developing the potential of their children. I hope that leaders in Chinese educational circles should take some measures to develop the potential of their children. I am very confident about it. </s>	don't encourage their children to participate in extra activities </s>
Question: The best title for this passage may be _ . Context: One day, Soapy Smith and I visited a shelter for badly-treated women located in a deserted section of the city. No one smiled a greeting, and they appeared uninterested in Soapy. One little girl in particular moved like a wisp in the background. The staff informed me that she had been there for over a month and had not spoken the entire time. Her mother said she had talked at one time but not in recent memory. I didn't want to imagine what could have happened to rob this little girl of the natural curiosity and enthusiasm so natural to childhood. Spreading a blanket on the floor, I sat down and put Soapy on the blanket. As the silent child circled past me, I told the group that Soapy would come to talk to them if they sat on his blanket. Several children did this, including the silent girl. She sat rigidly at the edge of the blanket, legs held stiffly out straight in front of her. She was staring hard at Soapy. It appeared that he kept making eye contact with her. She didn't reach out to him or encourage him in any way. Rather she sat tensely, just staring. Finally Soapy came to a stop about two inches from her. He quietly reached out and laid his chin on her knee. I was astonished. While a common behavior for dogs, this is not a behavior exhibited by rabbits, especially not by this rabbit. The child did not reach out to touch Soapy. Instead, she slowly leaned toward him. When her face was within inches of his, she carefully reached out and circled him with her arms. So softly that no one in the room could hear, she began to talk. Folded around the rabbit, she pillowed her head on his back and whispered to him. Soapy remained motionless. I looked up and noticed that the shelter workers had stopped talking. Every adult in the room froze in place. Time seemed to have stopped. The little girl reappeared when I was preparing to leave. She reached her hands out and looked me directly in the eye. I held Soapy out to her. She wrapped him in a big hug and pressed her face against him. Suspended from my hands as he was, I was concerned that he would begin to struggle. Instead he reached out his head again and laid it on the child's shoulder. His breathing slowed and he closed his eyes. As quickly as it happened, the little girl released her hug and stepped back. As she turned away, I thought I saw the beginnings of a faint smile. The rabbit in his cloud of soft, warm fur had touched something deep in the child -- something that had died from too much hard experience. Soapy's innocence and trust appeared to arouse those very same qualities in the little girl. It seems the language of the heart is simple after all. </s>	The Language of The Heart </s>

In a year of good rainfall, they form wide rings. In a dry year, they form narrow ones. Scientists do not have to cut down a pine to study its rings. With a special tool, they remove a narrow piece of wood from the trunk without harming the tree. Then they look at the width of each ring to see how much rain fell in the year it formed. Some pines are hundreds of years old and have hundreds of rings. These rings are from an annual record o0f past rainfall in the southwest. </s>	a tree grows faster when it has a lot of water </s>

""I want to do something for the Olympics. It is also a kind of learning for me,"" said the fourth-year student at Beijing Foreign Studies University. Now it is time for Xue to act on her plan. The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the 2008 Olympiad will start to recruit volunteers on August 28. The Olympics will need around 70,000 volunteers and the Paralympic Games will need another 30,000. University students like Xue will make up the majority of the volunteers. But the Olympics also need other volunteers - ordinary citizens and foreigners, for example. Students in Beijing should apply through their universities. Other volunteers may apply online or submit a written application. The online application system and a hotline will be open next Monday. For applicants outside Beijing, the application process begins in December. There is plenty of work for volunteers to do. For example, there will be chances to help publicize the games over the next two years. During the games themselves, volunteers will clean, serve food, marshal or offer language help. The Sydney Olympics in 2000 was the first that placed special emphasis on the role of volunteers. It used more than 45,000 volunteers in different roles. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, around 45,000 volunteers were used. More than 70,000 volunteers will be needed for the Olympic games and Paralympic Games in 2012, the London Olympic Organizing Committee has said. </s>"	learning more </s>
"Question: Why did the author set up Condition One ? Context: Where Virtual Reality Takes Us No matter how enlightened any one of us may be , we are fundamentally limited to our own points of view--but it is human nature to try to broaden our perspective . For me , that's where V.R. comes in . I have found that the medium has an extraordinary ability to convey the kinds of feelings of presence and place I've always desired to capture through photojournalism . As a young photographer , I was shocked by the wartime images of great photographers like Robert Capa and James Nachtwey . Their vision of the world is far better than my own . Hoping to imitate their effect , I trained myself to follow in their footsteps , covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a photojournalist for The New York Times and Newsweek . But I found that my photographs were not having the impact that I had hoped . There was something too abstract and flat about them , a quality that allowed anyone viewing them to remain distant from images of suffering . Frustrated by the barriers , I built a camera that could shoot steady , cinematic video in a war zone , and I made a feature-length film in Afghanistan . While the film provided a glimpse into the cruel reality of war , it was only a small window into that world . I wanted to go further , to pull people through that window onto the front lines and let them witness it firsthand . I started the technology company Condition One in order to build a new camera to shoot in 3D , 360-degree video . We want to introduce a new generation of viewers tired of flat images into the emotions of being immersed in a whole new world . The power of virtual reality is its command of presence--its ability to transport the viewer into another world , and have him feel present in it . These experiences are technically difficult to create and require significant computing power , but once presence is achieved and maintained , it is breathtaking . In V.R., we instinctively feel empathy for those whose experiences we are immersed in . The suffering of people in war zones becomes our suffering , just as the killing of animals in the wild becomes a source of our pain as well . Mentioning his own limitations of perspective , Einstein once wrote with sadness , "" Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of sympathy to hug all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty . "" Through V.R., we now have a chance to do just that . </s>"	To help viewers have a better feeling of presence . </s>
"Question: When the author first went to Huaplee Beach, _ Context: You've flown halfway around the world; you've sniffed out this place that nobody in Falongland or Thailand seems to have ever heard of; so what on earth is there to do here? You consider this question as you sink into an old wooden beach chair that holds you above the sand. It was a long journey from Bangkok to Huaplee. By the time you found the bus station and got yourself sorted out, it took almost as long as the flight from Falongland. Huaplee is located just south of Hua Hin, about two hundred kilometres from Bangkok, down the west side of the Gulf of Thailand. Not many tourists find this place,and the ones that do wonder if finding it has been their purpose all along. There's an apparent laziness that surrounds you here. It's what this place offers, and it,s free of charge. The small waves that tap the shoreline seem to slow everything down. You settle into your beach chair in preparation for a long rest. You sit there and watch the sea. It's early afternoon, so the cook comes out and asks what you'd like to eat this evening. Before long he's rushed off to the market to buy the ingredients for whatever it was that you ordered---every meal fresh and to order. No menu here. There is no poolside noise here but just that wonderfully warm, clear blue sea. There9s no street noise. The only sounds are the murmurs of nature.For now you just count your blessings ,listing them in the sand with your toe * You don't have to worry about being late for work. You don't have to do anything. The beach to your right stretches off to the horizon ,slowly narrowing to nothingness only to re-emerge again on your left, now steadily widening until it covers the chair beneath you. Sand to your left and sand to your right; it's unbroken, endless. No start, no end, just sand, sun,and peace. Step off it, and you re-enter the world of traffic, stress, work,and hurry. Normally you,re the type who can,t sit still for more than ten minutes, but you're on Huaplee Lazy Beach now and, in the right frame of mind, it stretches all the way around theworld.

"Question: How did the twins get their names? Context: Mei Lun and Mei Huan have been the first giant twin pandas born in the US since 1987. The names of these twin male giant panda cubs were announced at Atlanta Zoo last year. Lun Lun, a 15-year-old giant panda, gave birth to the cubs on July 15, 2013. Zoo officials followed Chinese custom and named the brothers after waiting 100 days. Until then, they were simply known as ""Cub A"" and "" Cub B"". Mei Lun and Mei Huan are the first twin panda cubs to survive in the Unite States. ""We're delighted to finally be able to place two youngsters with names. They have not only made a mark on the history of Atlanta Zoo, but also have made history in the US,"" Raymond B. King , the zoo's president and CEO, said in a statement. Atlanta Zoo teamed up with Good Morning America that month to put the pandas' names to a public vote. China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding provided the choices of names. In just 13 days, 51,000 votes poured in on the show's website. Under a deal between China and the US, giant pandas originally from China are only lent to foreign zoos for scientific study for several years. Zookeepers at Atlanta Zoo are giving regular updates on the twins' progress in an online blog. Mei Lun and Mei Huan are the fourth and fifth offspring of Lun Lun and a male giant panda named Yang Yang. The pandas made their first public appearance in a US exhibit last fall. For the three months before their appearance, the online world had watched the twins grow strong and healthy. ""We share this joy with our colleagues in China and with the cub's fans around the world,"" King said. </s>"	China provided their names for votes. </s>
"Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Context: Adults are happy to tell their children that crusts will give them curly hair, carrots will help them see in the dark, and spinach will make them strong. Even though adults know it's not totally true, they think it's good for their children's health, a study had found. In a study about 31 per cent of adults said they once told their children the curly hair tale, and 36 per cent said they'd been told the same thing by their mother or father. Among the over-50s, almost half said they'd been promised curly hair if they ate their crusts. A quarter of the 2,000 adults questioned in the study told their children carrots would help them see in the dark. This could be true to some extent because of the high levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene in root vegetables. Another favorite among parents is that milk will make one strong. A third surveyed said their parents told them this, and about 29 per cent said they told their children the same thing. But while there is plenty of evidence to suggest milk is good for people's health, there are also a lot of scientific papers saying it isn't. Thanks to Popeye, spinach is also fed to children, along with the idea that it will make them strong. While there is also some truth in this one, scientists now believe it is not the iron, but the inorganic nitrates that improve physical power. One in seven of the surveyed admitted telling their little ones that runner beans will make them run faster, which is nothing more than wordplay and has no basis in science. Almost one in five adults were subjected to the same tale in childhood. Just over one in 10 parents told their children green food would turn them into a superhero, and a quarter admitted hiding vegetables in meals. Lyndsay Jones, spokesman for Persil Washing Up Liquid, said, ""It's clear that the most persuasive stories about food are passed on from generation to generation. Our research shows that the ideas continue, and we tell our kids the same things our parents told us, even if they're not always entirely true."" Crusts may not make your hair curly, but there's plenty of research that says crusts contain more of the goodness than the rest of a loaf. Hopefully, as a result of our Cook with Kids promise, more parents will be encouraged to spend time with their children in the kitchen and teach them the truth about food. </s>"	parents are expected to tell children the truth about food </s>

Question: In teaching yourself, the first thing you must do is _ . Context: Students learn their lessons in class. In class teachers teach them. Students sit in the classroom listening to the teacher. This is a way of learning. Is this the only way for students to learn something? Of course not. There is another way to learn: students can teach themselves. For example, if you can't remember something when you are doing your homework, you can look at your book to find the answer. This is a way to teach yourself. And it is not a difficult thing. We can do this at any place and at any time. How do you teach yourself? The first thing you must do is reading. Read something you are interested in. or you have to read. The second is that you must ask yourself questions. The question is something you don't understand, or you want to know more about. You can write down these questions. A clever student is usually good at asking questions. The third is to answer the question yourself by thinking hard, by reading the passage or other books, and sometimes by asking other people. This is the way of teaching yourself. And you must do this all by yourself. If you keep doing like for a long time, you are sure to succeed in your study. </s>	reading </s>

You excitedly write down all the changes you are going to make, but by the end of January those ideas get lost in your busy life. Here's a suggestion: Forget the too big, hard-to-achieve goals and just think about the small ones. ""We often think that we have to do everything in big steps, even though it's so hard for us to reach it."" said Robert Maurer, who recently wrote the book One Small Step Can Change Your Life.

Question: From this passage, which do you think is the most important way while in danger? Context: Jan was a window cleaner. One morning, Jan was in a lift of a high building with his window cleaning tools when the building was on fire. There were five other passengers in the lift. All of a sudden the lift stopped. Although they didn't know what had happened outside, they had only 100 minutes to get out of the building before it would fall into the dust. Soon smoke began coming into the lift. The men knew that something was wrong. They tried to open the door but found a wall in front of them. The wall had the number 15 on it and they knew they were on the 15th floor. But their lift usually didn't stop there, so there was no opening for them to escape. Jan decided they would have to make their own. Knowing that the wall was made of a material that could be cut through, Jan took out his window cleaning tools, and began knocking a hole through the wall. When he felt tired, others helped. Starting with one small hole, they cut through the three-inch-thick wall. Then they kicked hard at the wall. The wall cracked apart. They saw before them a tile wall! Refusing to give up, they knocked a hole through the tile, then made the opening big enough to get through. Surprisingly, the fire-fighters were outside the hole, they took Jan and his partners to the nearest stairs and they ran down the stairs as quickly as possible. By 10:23, Jan and the others ran out of the building. Five minutes later, the building burned down. </s>	Staying calm. </s>
"Question: Why didn't his colleagues agree to the method of blood-washing? Context: Dr Asim Syed, 32, has performed more than 100 operations at London's Hammersmith Hospital in the country's busiest transplant unit, but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself. He stepped forward when was told his 64-year-old mother might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney . The worried surgeon brought her to London to be cared for at his hospital. However, it was not all plain sailing. Tests showed Dr Syed was the wrong blood group, so the only way was to go through a special blood-washing process. He consulted colleagues about that, but they didn't agree, because the risk of rejection is still too high. Dr Syed and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving, called an organ-paired. That is, Dr Syed donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother. The chain of three transplants took place at the same time on July 31 with Dr Syed's kidney going to a recipient in the Midlands and Mrs. Syed receiving her kidney from a person in the south of England. Just hours after donating his own kidney, Dr Syed found himself recovering in bed next to his mother. Mrs Syed said, ""When I came round from my operation Asim was in the next bed and the first thing he said was, 'Mum now all your worries are over.' Tears fell down."" Now mother and son are recovering well with Dr Syed already back at work. Mrs. Syed is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress.

Question: Why do large numbers of people come to Pompeii each year? Context: Every year thousands of tourists visit Pompeii, Italy. They see the sights that Pompeii is famous for-its stadium and theatres, its shops and restaurants. The tourists do not, however, see Pompeii's people. They do not see them because Pompeii has no people. No one has lived in Pompeii for almost 2000 years. Once, Pompeii was a busy city of 22,000 people. It lay at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, a grass-covered volcano. Mount Vesuvius had not erupted for centuries, so the people of Pompeii felt safe, But they were not. In August of AD 79 , Mount Vesuvius erupted. The entire top of the mountain exploded, and a huge black cloud rose into the air. Soon stones and hot ash began to fall on Pompeii . When the eruption ended , Pompeii was hurried under 20 feet of stones and ashes. Almost all of its people were dead. For centuries, Pompeii lay buried under stone and ash. Then, in the year 1861,an Italian scientist named Ginseppe began to uncover Pompeii. Slowly, carefully, Ginseppe and his men dug. The city looked almost the same as it had looked in AD79 , There were streets and fountains, houses and shops, There was a stadium with 20,000 seats , Perhaps the most important of all, there were everyday objects, which tell us a great deal about the people who lived in Pompeii. Many glasses and jars had some dark blue color in the bottom, so we know that the people of Pompeii liked wine, They liked bread, too; metal bread pans were in the bakery .In one bakery there were 81 round , flat loaves of bread -a type of bread that is still sold in Italy today . Tiny boxes filled with a dark, shiny powder tell us that women liked to wear eye-makeup. </s>	To see how Pompeians lived </s>
Question: According to the passage, Switzerland is famous for _ . Context: Switzerland is one of the most developed countries in Europe. It is famous as one of the cleanest countries in the world. The Swiss think that recycling is very important. The government has made laws which require everyone to recycle. In 1998, the Swiss government passed a law which says that people can not throw away any electronic machines. Instead, people are told to bring old ones, such as televisions, computers and fridges, to special centers when they didn't need them. Many parts of the old machines are reused, and only the parts that can't be used are thrown away. The government also charges a rubbish bag tax . If people want their rubbish to be collected, they must buy yellow stickers and put them on their rubbish bags. In 2003, 47% of all rubbish in the cities was recycled. This included 70% of paper, 95%of glass, 71%of plastic bottles and 85--90%of cans. Until recently, people could get a small amount of money when they recycled their bottles. Recycling has become a daily habit for the Swiss. Everyone should learn from the Swiss, and our country will be clean like Switzerland. </s>	its environment </s>
Question: EO-1 takes photographs of the same places as Landsat because _ . Context: Geography is the study of Earth and its climates. Scientists use it to study global warming and track the weather. Governments use it to learn where people live and work and to plan what to do with the land. It is now easier than ever to use geography because of a science called space technology. The United States launched its first satellite in 1958. Some space missions that followed were geographical studies. In fact, earth science is a big part of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Astronauts looked out of the space shuttle. They decided to take photographs of Earth from their vantage point. Over the years, picture quality improved. Shuttle photography now shows land features, such as rivers. It can even show the streets of large cities. Photos of the same places at different times show how the land is changing. NASA does not use just photographs, though. In 1958 it launched TIROS (the Television Infrared Observation Satellite). This first use of a satellite to study Earth was effective in giving weather forecasts. It led to the creation of new space tools to use in geography. The Landsat Program began in 1972. This satellite sent detailed views of Earth from space. The pictures were so precise that scientists could count the number and kinds of crops in a field. Landsat showed where Earth's surface had faults along which earthquakes might happen. This information helped in the planning of new cities and factories. Landsat also made discoveries. In Antarctica it located ranges of unknown mountains. It pinpointed small lakes in Virginia that were no ton maps. Landsat, now more advanced, still flies today. Another space tool is Earth Observing-1 (EO-1). This spacecraft flies right behind Landsat. It takes pictures of the same sites. The two sets of pictures, viewed together, show how cities grow and how other places, such as rain forests, become smaller over time. This helps scientists learn how people affect geography. One of the newest space tools is the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is computer software that helps scientists to study Earth. GIS is different from earlier space tools. Businesses, schools, and even average people -- not just the government --can use it to show them how changes in the planet might affect them. </s>	the two groups of pictures can show the changes of Earth </s>
Question: We can see from this passage _ . Context: Millions of years ago dinosaurs lived on the earth. In the days of dinosaurs the whole earth was warm and wet. There were green forests and they could find enough to eat. Later, parts of the earth became cold and dry. and the forests there died. Then dinosaurs could not find enough to cat. This must be one reason why dinosaurs died out. We can guess another reason. New kinds of animals came on the earth. Some had big brains and were fast and strong. They could kill dinosaurs. There may be other reasons that we don't know about yet. Scientists are trying to make more discoveries about dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were of many sizes and shapes . Some were as small as chickens, while some were about 90 feet long. There were also terrible fights between dinosaurs. They might have happened more than 100 million years ago. Though there was no man to see any of the fights, we can be told by the animal's footprints that fight did take place. </s>	dinosaurs are worth studying </s>
Question: You can learn about the writer's history with money _ . Context: Today, we are talking about money. I can share a bit about my history with money and my new view when it comes to using _ I made a web page with links to posts about our financial journey where you can look for more details of where we've been and how we got where we are now. It was a big part of my story in the past and was a huge part of our downsizing journey. We got out of debt and stayed out of debt. So I feel eager to share the benefits of being on this side. It takes planning and more careful thought whenever a dollar is spent now than it did when I had a wallet full of credit cards. I now like to think all of my dollars having a job. So many of us work for money and don't consider that money should work for us, too. Make your dollars do the job of helping you live the life you want. Each time money is spent or saved, it should be going toward something that you purposefully want for your life. Last week I was out and I spent $20 on food in 3 days. It made me angry because afterward I thought about eating is not at all what for my life. On the other hand, there are times I spend $20 while out with my family and it doesn't bother me one bit. An afternoon out with my kids during which we stop for ice cream, and do something fun together has a completely different feel to it. In the end, I want the dollars I spend to have purpose like I can enjoy life while still planning and saving for the future. </s>	by reading posts about their financial journey </s>
"Question: According to the reading _ . Context: There is a saying, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" Although eating properly is important, being kind to others is also good tor your health. Studies show that people who perform kind acts are more relaxed, happier, and healthier than other people. In one study at Arizona State University researchers, found that many volunteers experienced a sudden feeling of joy, followed by a long period of calm, after performing a kind act. This feeling, called ""a help's high"" may actually help reduce stress as the body releases naturally painkillers. Stress can cause' serious health problems, and heart depression, and .sleeping problems. However, the study found that volunteers had fewer *stress-related health problems when they did helpful things for other people. The study also found that people who did nice things for others felt better about themselves as well. They had higher self-esteem , and were' happier. Many believe this is because volunteers spend more of their time with other people. People who are more outgoing are often healthier. Another study at the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center confirmed the health benefits of volunteering. A ten-year study showed that people who volunteered live longer than those who didn't. Although you shouldn't need a reason to be helpful, it is nice to know that kindness may help you live longer. </s>"	kindness can help you feel healthy </s>
Question: The writer was put in prison because he _ . Context: Over the last six years I have learned what patience is. Growing up I did not have this virtue and it is a very important virtue to have. Now I can see that if you are patient you will almost always get what you want if you are supposed to have it. I gained patience when I lost my freedom. I knew that I would eventually get it back in time. I was locked up in prison for a period of six years because at 19 years old I was playing with a handgun and I accidentally shot and killed my friend. The first couple of years was the hardest.I was always stressed out about everything.Time was dragging by because I was always paying attention to it.While I was locked up,Tom who I talked to helped put this virtue in me.He told me that it was possible that he would never make it home but that being patient and believing that one day he would was what had made him feel better.After a while I realized why he said a lot of things to me.Once I stopped paying attention to the days and just kept in mind that I would get freedom,it seemed that my time passed quickly. Now I am home and can see that patience paid off for me. I now use this virtue in my daily activities. I know that sometimes life gets hard and that it will pay in the end to stay patient and not to get discouraged. So if you are having a hard time in life,be patient and it will eventually work out one way or another. </s>	killed his friend accidentally with a handgun </s>
Question: Which of the following tribes lived in the Iron Ages? Context: England became England, the land of English-speaking people, at the beginning of the Middle Ages. Before that it had been the home of Iron Age tribes known as Celts, and for a time, part of the Roman Empire. Then beginning in the 400s AD, tribes from the north, known as the Engles, the Saxons, and the Jutes, moved in. The most famous leader of this time period in England was Alfred the Great. Alfred lived in Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, which was in the southern part of England. He was a good leader who made his kingdom stronger. He created a system of defenses , called burhs, across the country. He reorganized the army so that his men had time to fight and time to farm. Alfred's efforts protected his people from the Vikings and allowed Wessex to grow. Eventually the rulers of Wessex would rule all of England. Alfred also made other improvements. He made laws for his people. He encouraged learning and translated several important books into his Saxon language. This was the beginning of the language we call English today. Two important pieces of literature from that time period are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Beowulf, both written in Old English. Old English lasted through most of the Middle Ages. Middle English came in during the late Middle Ages, and Modern English began about the time of the Renaissance. England and English got their names, not from the Saxons, but from one of the other tribes, and Angles. The original name of England must have been something like Angle-land(only in old English of course). </s>	The Celts. </s>
"Question: Which is not included in social interaction? Context: A team of US psychologists have found that talking to another person for ten minutes a day helps with memory. ""Socializing is just as effective as more traditional kinds of mental exercise in memory and intellectual performance,"" Oscar Ybarra, a psychologist at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, said in a statement. In one investigation, they analyzed data on 3610 people, aged 24 to 96. They found that the higher their level of social interaction , the better their cognitive functioning. Social interaction includes getting together or having phone chats with relatives, freinds and neighbors. In another experiment, the researchers conducted lab tests on 76 college students, aged 18 to 21, to evaluate how social interactions and intellectual exercises affected the results of memory and mental performance tests. The students were divided into three groups: the social interaction group had a discussion of a social issue for 10 minutes before taking the tests; the intellectual activities group completed three tasks (including a reading comprehension exercise and a crossword puzzle) before the tests; and a control group watched a 10-minute clip of the Seinfeld television show. ""We found that short-term social interaction lasting for just 10 minutes improved participants' intellectual performance as much as engaging in so-called 'intellectual' activities for the same amount of time,"" Ybarra said. The study was expected to be published in the February issue of the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. </s>"	Watching TV at home alone. </s>
Question: In writing the passage, the author mainly intends to _ . Context: There exist cruel wars, fighting and sadness in the world today, so it's not only necessary, but also essential to have a good sense of humor just to help us go through difficult times in our lives. Putting a smile on someone's face when you know they are feeling depressed, as the saying goes, makes me feel good and warms my heart. How would you feel if you could not joke around with your wife, husband, child, co-worker neighbor, close friend, or even just someone that you are standing in line with at your corner store? I am always saying things that make others smile or laugh, even if I don't know the person I'm joking around with. My Grandma always found humor in everything she did, even if it was the hardest job anyone could imagine. This not only relieves stress in any situation, but also is a common manner to speak to others that are around you. I know of a few people that don't have a funny bone in their bodies, as they say. Everyone around them could be rolling on the floor after hearing a great joke and they would sit there without the slightest smile on their face. They don't get the joke that makes others laugh. I am busting a gut while they just sit there, looking at me as if I were from outer space. How can people not get a really funny joke? Laughing is essential to keep your stress levels under control. Without humor we would find ourselves with a lot of psychological problems, or on a lot of medications to keep us from going crazy. There is too much sadness in this present world. It drives people crazy. We all need to find a way to avoid the sadness and bring a little light into our lives. Therefore, I believe our best medicine is to get together and tell some jokes and have some fun laughing together. </s>	encourage people to be humorous in daily life </s>

"Question: The two brothers wrote down all the stories because _ . Context: Once upon a time there lived two brothers named Jacob and William in Germany. They liked to listen to old stories and then write them down. So they had enough stories to make a book. You can guess the name of the book! It is Grimms' Fairy Tales. The story of this little book began when the brothers were still in school. And it started with a good teacher. The teacher liked to find out how things happened. Soon the two brothers were doing the same thing. They asked questions and then looked for answers. Among the questions the brothers asked, ""Who made up the old fairy tales? Who first told about Cinderella ? Why made up the story of the Snow White and the story of Sleeping Beauty?""They found that no one knew the answers to such questions. The tales were made up in very early times. Most of them were made up in the days before people knew how to write. People told the stories to one another and to their children. But only a few old people still remembered them. ""When old people die, the stories will die with them,"" said the brothers. ""We must write down all the stories we can find."" Jacob and William hunted for stories for five years. At last they had 89 tales written. Just before Christmas in 1812, the first book was published. People love the book! They asked more fairy tales.

Question: What do you think of the author in the passage? Context: The Christmas season is often considered the season of giving. Many of us spend a lot of effort and money in an attempt to give our friends and loved ones the best possible gift. But what is the best gift you could possibly give? Imagine that your bank gave you an account with $86,400 every morning of every day. You could use this amount of money for anything you want. But at the end of every day, the bank tells you that money in the account can only be used within that day. How would you choose to spend this money? This is the attitude we should take towards the time. Time can never get back. It is the only resource that no one can get more than another person. Around the holiday season, we find ourselves very busy. It is a point in the year where how you spend your time is crucial. Spending this valuable time to help another human being in need is one of the greatest gifts we can give. We never know when even giving a short amount of time to help or listen to a stranger, could make the rest of their day much more pleasant. However, the saying that money is time is one of the truest statements ever made. By the act of donating money to a non profit organization which helps -- for example, you are allowing that single mother to spend more time looking after her children, instead of being forced to spend time looking for a temporary second job. By donating some money, you have helped someone else use their time for a better cause. One organization I personally would encourage you to consider spending your time and/or money would be Eva Initiatives, an organization created for the homeless. I have volunteered there twice. It was a very positive experience, and being able to learn more about who lived there really gave me a perspective on the real struggles of the people around us. </s>	Warm-hearted. </s>
"Question: What is the main idea of the passage?

That was before we entered _ in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we've made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Klompus who says of her students ""so passive"" and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Klompus, contributes to children's passivity. ""We're talking about a generation of kids who've never been hurt or hungry. They have learned somebody will always do it for them, instead of saying 'go and look it up', you tell them the answer. It takes greater energy to say no to a kid."" Yes, it does. It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work.

Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Context: A newly-published study has shown that loneliness can spread from one person to another, like a disease. Researchers used information from the Framingham Study, which began in 1948. The Framingham Study gathers information about physical and mental health, personal behavior and diet. At first, the study involved about 5,000 people in the American state of Massachusetts. Now, more than 12,000 individuals are taking part. Information from the Framingham Study showed earlier that happiness can spread from person to person. So can behaviors like littering and the ability to stop smoking. University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo led the recent study. He and other researchers attempted to show how often people felt lonely. They found that the feeling of loneliness spread through social groups. Having a social connection with a lonely person increased the chances that another individual would feel lonely. In fact, a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness. A friend of that person was 25% more likely. The researchers say this shows that a person could indirectly be affected by someone's loneliness. The effect was strongest among friends. Neighbors were the second most affected group. The effect was weaker on husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. The researchers also found that loneliness spread more easily among women than men. The New York Times newspaper reports that, on average, people experience feelings of loneliness about 48 days a year. It also found that every additional friend can decrease loneliness by about five percent, or two and a half fewer lonely days. Loneliness has been linked to health problems like depression and sleeping difficulties. The researchers believe that knowing the causes of loneliness could help in reducing it. The study suggests that people can take steps to stop the spread of loneliness. They can do this by helping individuals they know who may be experiencing loneliness. The result can be helpful to the whole social group. </s>	Lonely people can affect others. </s>
Question: What will humans do in order to keep the world under control? Context: People have always been wondering about what our future will look like. Go on reading this text, and you will know what will happen in the next fifty years. How can we know what the future will look like? To be able to understand the future, you must know the past. What has taken us to where we are today and what has changed along the way? The world has changed a lot in the last 150 years, but we humans are driven by the same basic needs as we were 150 years ago. Will this change in the next 150 years? No. What inventions have really made a difference in the last 150 years? In the past years, the inventions that have affected most people around the world for everyday living are the telephone, electricity, radio, television, computer, the car and the ability to communicate through the Internet. Then we of course have a lot of inventions that have made life easier, like new medicine, faster transports etc. In general, human beings have been working hard in the last 150 years to make the inventions so that they will be able to get control of the time and the world. Since there is still much to do in this area, this will be the focus at least for the next 150 years. Why do we need to predict the future? Predicting the future is important for two reasons first we need to start to think about what kind of future we would like for ourselves and to pass on to the next generation, and then we need to know what decisions we need to make today that will give the best result in the future. </s>	To focus on making more inventions. </s>

Question: The author hopes that studies on the influence of geographical environment will enable us to _ Context: A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are. It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats. Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous. But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows? We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies. </s>	gain an insight into its influence on mankind </s>
"Question: From this passage we can infer that about 9,500 pilots in the USA are allowed to carry _ while flying. Context: WASHINGTON--More than one in 10 of the nation's airline pilots are cleared to carry a handgun while flying, and the number will continue to grow, according to a Transportation Security Administration projection. The Federal Air Marshal Service, a TSA agency that runs the armed-pilots program, reports that 85,000 to 90,000 pilots and crewmembers flying domestic passengers and cargo planes are eligible to carry a gun. That puts the number of armed pilots at about 9,500. The TSA projects the program to grow to 16.5% of eligible pilots by the year 2011. Aviation experts were surprised and alarmed that so many pilots are toting guns in the sky. ""That's a big number compared to what I thought it would be,"" said aviation-security consultant Rich Roth, who said he had predicted there would be fewer than 1,000 armed pilots. The 5-year-old program trains pilots for one week and arms them with 40-caliber semiautomatic pistols. ""That's a scary number,"" said Joseph Gutheinz, a former Transportation Department special agent and aviation attorney in Houston. ""By allowing so many pilots the opportunity to fly armed, we're giving terrorists opportunity to identify somebody who has a gun and overpower him."" Capt. Bob Hesselbein, head of security for the Air Line Pilots Association, said the number of armed pilots is ""a tremendous deterrent "" to hijackings. ""The challenge of an organized terrorist team is to take control of the cabin, then the flight deck.""

Question: What can be inferred from the river? Context: A castle is a type of fortified structure built in Europe and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. This is different from a palace, which is no fortified-though there are many similarities among these types of construction. Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to diverse structures. The European castles originated in the 9thand 10thcenturies, resulting in its land divided among nobles. These nobles built castles to control the area surrounding them, and they were both offensive and defensive structures. Although army uses are often emphasized in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local people and important travel routes, and rural castles were often built near farmland. Many castles were originally built from earth and wood, but had their defences _ later by stone. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, scientific approaches to castle defence appeared, and could function to maximize the castle's firepower. These changes in defence came from a mixture of castle technology. Although gunpowder was introduced to be built well into the 16thcentury, improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable places to live in. As a result, true castles went into decline. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose. </s>	Castles have a history of more than 1,000 years in Europe. </s>

The United Nations hopes to cut this number in half by 2015. Solving such a big problem seems like an unreal challenge. But everyone, even teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the U.S. has set an example to others of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work of collecting deserted batteries which pollute water. In 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There, she saw an exhibit about how chemicals in old batteries harm the water of Lake Erie. Haggerty learnt that recycling the batteries was an easy solution. ""I think everybody can do it, because everyone uses batteries, and it can make a big difference."" With these words, she began to increase awareness in her area. She talked to her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programmed in schools as well as the public libraries, hospitals, and churches. With the help from her family, friends and local waste-management officials, she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made an educational video. Over the past two years, she collected four tons of batteries and drew the attention of officials, who were in charge of a battery recycling programmed but had made little progress. When asked if she feels like a hero, Haggerty is quite modest . ""Not really. Well, maybe for the fish I saved!""

Question: After hearing his colleague's description of Maria, the writer thought that Maria _ . Context: Several years ago, I had to replace a receptionist for my unit. Before I advertised for the position, I was approached by another manager, and asked ifl would consider a transfer from his staffinstead of opening a new competition. My natural question was to ask who he wanted me to consider and why. It appeared from his description of this employee, Maria, that she was having a lot of problems performing her duties, and had difficulties with her boss, and did not appear to respond to any attempts he, the manager, had made to settle the issues. Now, after listening to his explanation, I really had severe doubts. What crossed my mind, after this discussion, was that he wanted me to take a problem off his hands. I told him I would think about it and would let him know the next day. As promised, after thinking more about this potential performance issue, I decided that I would agree to speak with Maria privately before I made any decision. And, what I found out during this interview, left me deep in thought. As it tumed out, the performance issue appeared to result from working for a boss who never extended a good morning. greeting, never gave a word of encouragement, and was constantly changing the work load and routines. The end result was a totally ruined employee who was unconfident, hated to see a new work day start. I decided to accept her transfer to my unit. What started out as a shy, withdrawn and frightened employee turned out to be one of the most productive and loyal employee that I had eyer worked with. Maria couldn't do enough and was constantly asking for more and for more responsibility. I was morethan happy to give her what she needed-praise for work well done, respect as a person, and encouragement for doing well in anything she dealt with.

Based on their school reports, clever and diligent, Xiao Xue is a much better student than her brother, Liu Xing,"" says Wu Hao, 16, Chifeng in Inner Mongolia. ""The boy should work harder at studying since our duty as students is to study well."" It is generally accepted that getting good scores is crucial for a student. So to some, being a good student means ranking high in your class or even your school. However, Wu also admits that a student's personality is more important in being a role model student. ""Honesty and kindness make you admirable. But Xiao Xue can be selfish, dishonest and arrogant, which make others feel uncomfortable to be around her. So she has a lot yet to improve on,"" Wu said. Many teenagers do not think it is fair to judge students by their grades. Take Liu Xing for example.

"Question: The example of Carmen Arace Middle School in the passage is used to _ . Context: Carmen Arace Middle School is situated in the pastoral town of Bloomfield, Conn., but four years ago it faced many of the same problems as inner-city schools in nearby Hartford: low scores on standardized tests and dropping enrollment . Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million. Now, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%. Indeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example. Governor Angus King had planned using $50 million to buy a laptop for all of Maine's 17,000 seventh-graders - and for new seventh-graders each fall. In the same spirit, the New York City board of education voted on April 12 to create a school Internet portal , which would make money by selling ads and licensing public school students. Profits will also provide e-mail service for the city's 1.1 million public school students. Profits will be used to buy laptops for each of the school system's 87,000 fourth-graders. Within nine years, all students in grades 4 and higher will have their own computers. Back in Bloomfield, in the meantime, most of the _ have been worked out. Some students were using their computers to visit unauthorized websites. But teachers have the ability to keep an eye on where students have been on the Web and to stop them. ""That is the worst when they disable you,"" says eighth-grade honors student Jamie Bassell. The habit is rubbing off on parents. ""I taught my mom to use e-mail,"" says another eighth-grader, Katherine Hypolite. ""And now she's taking computer classes.

My room at the hotel had been given to somebody else and they had no room for me. Harkin had known my travel plans and had planned everything. How could he have booked the room only for three days? There was nothing to be done but to find another hotel. The waiters were happy to find me a new hotel, and when I said that I was happy to stay at the airport, thinking it might be cheaper than staying in the city, they suggested the Holiday Inn at the airport. There was one small matter: the room rate was 300$ per night. The best hotel in Katoomba had wanted only 145$. I asked if there was anything cheaper they might suggest but they warned that most hotels would already be full by this time. The hotel was far from the train station, so I had to take a taxi, as 25$. On the way to the Holiday Inn, we passed a hotel just two blocks from the Holiday Inn that advertised a room rate of 104$. At the desk I asked if their room rate could go down a lot. ""No, this is a 4star hotel,"" the waiter told me. ""In that case,"" I replied, ""I'll just walk the two blocks to the cheap hotel.""

"Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author _ . Context: My dad was never the kind to offer many words of love or encouragement. But we knew he loved us... he just had his own way of showing it. When I was a teen, we were seasonal campers at a family campground almost an hour outside the city where we lived. Each family had their own campsite with water and electric, and you basically parked your camper there from May through October. Most ""Seasonals"" visited them every weekend during those months, with the occasional weeklong stay. There were plenty of other kids who camped seasonally each weekend, and they came to be some of my closest friends. Of course, many of them were boys. We kids paired up with our little boyfriends or girlfriends, and we'd hold hands as we'd walk around the campground. We'd play ping-pong, have some snacks, and play songs. Most weekends were pretty similar, but the couples would change. You'd see so-and-so with a different so-and-so than they were with the weekend before. You know how it is when you're a teen -- a three-week relationship is a really long time. So, needless to say, my teen years were spent with quite a few different boys. But every single one of them had something in common... they'd all received The Evil Eye. The Evil Eye was a magical sort of thing. One simple look from my dad, and the boy immediately knew not to _ me. It was as if he could send his warnings through invisible laser beams that shot directly from his eyes to the boys' brains. ""You will not put your hands on my daughter... You will not kiss my daughter... You will not even whisper sweet nothings into my daughter's ear."" I remember one night in particular, walking with a boy around the campground after dark. We came from one direction, and my dad from the other.

Question: Which of the following is the best for the blank? Context: Our children feel stressed out by an educational system that actually uses stress as an educational technique. It's a constant pressure of homework deadlines,essays and exams. And our children are told at a young age that failing a test means that they are failures in life. They'll end up nowhere if they don't pass this or that exam. Our educational system is based on a very Western idea that life is a struggle and you'd better measure up. It's survival of the fittest. While there is some truth to this,not as much as people think. Our ancestors didn't develop a constant stress environment. Back then,stress came quickly and was over quickly,it wasn't like the stress of modern education. Stress was originally just a shortterm biological response to danger;however,the constant stress of modern education rarely stops. It's long term,at least ten years and usually more. Recent research has shown that the neurological response to stress is the same response that is found in depression. So,what's the solution? A number have been proposed,including but not limited to the following. _ .Exercise consumes energy that would otherwise build up in the stress response and could cause physical and mental problems. Teach relaxation exercises. Allowing the mind and body to relax cuts off the stress response and reduces the neurological fatigue ,enabling the individual to recover at least somewhat. Pay attention to thinking. Training the stressed student to pay attention to his or her own mind to a point where he or she is sufficiently aware to shut off the stress response when necessary. Of course,there's a logical answer to the problem. Just rearrange our teaching methods to encourage,rather than prevent,the natural curiosity and joy in learning that we are all born with. This would remove the stress and probably cut learning time in half. </s>	Make sure that kids get exercise. </s>

Dogs bring much happiness to their owners, and even improve human health. Most two year olds keep us busy in life -- an important part of living a long and happy life. According to Stanley Coren, Ph.D.of the University of British Columbia, our dogs are smarter than we thought. Dr.Coren reviewed many studies to find out that dogs are as smart as 2 to 2.5 year olds. Forget about one word orders -- according to Coren, the smartest dogs can learn up to 250 words. Most dogs understand an average of 165 words. ""The upper limit of dogs"" ability to learn language is partly based on a study of a Border Collie named Rico who showed knowledge of 200 spoken words, and 'fast-track learning', which scientists believed to be found only in humans and language-learning apes . Dogs are also great at tricking. During play, they have the ability to trick humans and other dogs in order to get treats. ""And they are nearly as successful in tricking humans as humans are in tricking dogs, saysCoren. Dogs can also count to four or five, which might explain how they know when their toys are missing. Coren explains,""Their astonishing flashes of smartness and creativity are reminders that they may not be Ensteins, but are sure closer to humans than we thought."" Animals can do much to keep us happy, health, and protect us from harm. Stories of dog heroes can be found using a simple Internet search.

Instead of choosing one of his children, he decided on something different. He called all of the young people in the kingdom together one day. He said, ""It is time for me to choose the next emperor. I have decided to choose one of you."" The kids were shocked! But the emperor continued, ""I am going to give each one of you a seed today. One special seed. I want you to plant it and come back one year later with what you have grown from this seed. I will then judge the plants, and the one I choose will be the next emperor!"" One boy named Ling received a seed like the others. He went home and planted the seed in a pot, watering it carefully. Every day he would water it and watch to see if it had grown. After about three weeks, some of the other youths began to talk about their plants that were beginning to grow. Ling kept checking his seed, but nothing ever grew. A year finally went by and all the youths brought their plants to the emperor. Ling thought he should be honest about what had happened. So he took his empty pot to the palace. When Ling arrived, he was amazed at the plants grown by other youths. They were beautiful, in all shapes and sizes. When the emperor arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted the young people.

"Question: Hancock's research finding surprised those who believed that _ . Context: Communications technologies are far from equal when it comes to conveying the truth.The first study to compare honesty across a range of communication media has found that people are twice as likely to tell lies in phone conversations as they are in emails.The fact that emails are automatically recorded--and can come back to puzzle you---appears to be the key to the finding. Jeff Hancock of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, asked 30 students to keep a communications diary for a week.In it they noted the number of conversations or email exchanges they had lasting more than 10 minutes, and confessed to how many lies they told.Hancock then worked out the number of lies per conversation for each medium.He found that lies made up 14 per cent of emails, 21 percent of instant messages, 27 per cent of face-to-face interactions and an astonishing 37 percent of phone calls. His results to be presented at the conference on human-computer interaction in Vienna, Austria, in April, have surprised psychologists.Some expected emailers to be the biggest liars, reasoning that because deception makes people uncomfortable, the indirect contact of emailing would make it easier to lie.Others expected people to lie more in face-to-face exchanges because we are most practiced at that form of communication. But Hancock says it is also crucial whether a conversation is being recorded and could be reread, and whether it occurs in real time.People appear to be afraid to lie when they know the communication could later be used to hold them to account, he says.This is why fewer lies appear in email than on the phone. People are also more likely to lie in real time---in an instant message or phone call, say---than if they have time to think of a response, says Hancock.He found many lies are spontaneous responses to an unexpected demand, such as: ""Do you like my dress?"" Hancock hopes his research will help companies work out the best ways for their employees to communicate.For instance, the phone might be the best medium for sales where employees are encouraged to stretch the truth.But, given his result, work assessment where honesty is a priority, might be best done using email. </s>"	people are most likely to lie in email communication </s>
Question: Which of the following was first interrupted by the Europeans? Context: ABORIGINAL is a term used to describe the people and animals that lived in a place from the earliest known times or before Europeans arrived. Examples are the Maori in New Zealand, the Aborigines in Australia and the Indians in America. They all share the fact that they were pushed off their land by European settlers. Maori The Maori were the first people to go to New Zealand, about 1,000 years ago. They came from the islands of Polynesia in the Pacific. They brought dogs, rats and plants with them and settled mainly on the Northern Island. In 1769, Captain James Cook from Britain took possession of the Island and from that time British people started to settle. The Maori signed an agreement on land rights with these settlers, but in later years there were arguments and battles between them. Aborigines The native people of Australia came from somewhere in Asia more than 40,000 years ago. They lived by hunting and gathering. Their contact with British settlers began in 1788. By the 1940s almost all of them were mixed into Australian society as low-paid workers. Their rights were limited. In 1976 and 1993 the Australian Government passed laws that returned some land to the Aborigines and recognized their property rights. American Indians Long before the Europeans came to America in the 16th and 17th century, the American Indians, or Native Americans, lived there. It is believed that they came from Asia. Christopher Columbus mistook the land for India and so called the people there Indians. The white settlers and American Indians lived in peace at the beginning, but conflicts finally arose and led to the Indian Wars (1866-1890). After the wars, the Indians were driven to the west of the country. Not until 1924 did they gain the right to vote. </s>	American Indians. </s>
Question: Which of the following statements is true according the passage? Context: Have you seen Jurassic Park? In this film, scientists use DNA kept for tens of millions of years to clone dinosaurs. They find trouble, however, when they realize that the cloned creatures are smarter and more dangerous than expected. That's nothing more than a fiction. But could we really clone endangered animals? To date, the most successful attempt to do so was the cloning of a gaur, a rare ox-like animal from southeast Asia. Scientists used a cow to bring the cloned baby gaur, named Noah. Two days after birth, however, Noah died from a common bacterial infection. Other endangered species that may be cloned include the African bongo antelope , the Sumatran tiger, the cheetah , and the giant panda. Next, could we really clone extinct animals? In theory? Yes. To do this, you need a well-kept source of DNA from the extinct animals such as wool mammoth , Tasmanian tiger, or even dinosaur, and a closely related species, still living, which could serve as a surrogate mother. In reality? Probably not. On the one hand, it's not likely that extinct animals' DNA could survive undamaged for such a long time. Cloning extinct animals as wool mammoth, Tasmanian tiger, or dinosaur is much more difficult due to the lack of properly well-preserved DNA. On the other hand, for example, a gaur can have a cow as _ , definitely not a monkey. But what about an extinct animal as unique as the panda? What species could possibly serve as a surrogate mother? Cloning presents many exciting possibilities. However, even if extinct animals are brought back, they could not survive in today's world. Not only do most extinct animals have no habitat to live in, but the other plants and animals they depended on for food may also be gone as well. </s>	We could clone extinct animals in theory. </s>

In her new series ' Colour me Healthy', Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make. They can even change our emotions and influence how healthy we are. ""Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things ?"" says Verity. "" Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red. It's never green. For some reason we consider green products as being a bit unacceptable. It's the same for businesses. We respect a company writing its name in blue or black, but we don't respect one that uses pink or orange. People designing new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy."" During the four-part series, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each programme. She meets people who work in all aspects of the colour industry, from people designing food packets , to people naming the colours of lipsticks . Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to support their ideas, such as the American "" Colour Doctor"" who believes that serious diseases can be treated by the use of coloured lights. However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results. In a word, it's an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new. But because Verity goes out of her way to be polite to everyone she meets on the series, it's up to the viewers to make their own decisions about how much they should believe. </s>"	Part1--Blue and Black ; Part2--Red and Orange; Part3--White and Grey ; Part4--Green and Yellow </s>
Question: Food poisoning can be caused by all the following EXCEPT _ . Context: Food sometimes gets poisoned with harmful things. A person who eats such food can get an illness called food poisoning . Food poisoning is usually not serious, but some types are deadly. The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within hours of eating the poisoned food. Fever is one of the most common symptoms. Certain microorganisms cause most types of food poisoning. Bacteria and other microorganisms can poison eggs, meat, vegetables, and many other foods. After entering the body, these tiny living things release poisons that make people sick. Some chemicals can also cause food poisoning. They are often added to food while it is being grown, processed, or prepared. For example, many farmers spray chemicals on crops to kill weeds and insects. Some people may have a bad reaction to those chemicals when they eat the crops. Some plants and animals contain natural poisons that are harmful to people. These include certain kinds of seafood, grains, nuts, seeds, beans, and mushrooms. When people handle food properly, the risk of food poisoning is very small. Microorganisms multiply rapidly in dirty places and in warm temperatures. This means that people should never touch food with dirty hands or put food on unwashed surfaces. Food should be kept in a refrigerator to stop microorganisms from growing. Meat needs to be cooked thoroughly to kill any dangerous microorganisms. People should also wash food covered with chemicals before eating it. Finally, people should not eat wild mushrooms or other foods that grow in the wild. Some of these foods may contain natural materials that are poisonous to humans. In addition, some types of fish can be poisonous. Most people recover from food poisoning after a few days of resting and drinking extra water. If people eat natural poisons, they must go to the hospital right away to have their stomachs emptied. </s>	low temperatures </s>
"Question: What's the main influence of the new discovery? Context: They said highly anxious rats which were kept had very low levels of a brain chemical called fibroblast growth factor 2 or FGF2, compared with rats that were more relaxed. But when they improved the anxious rats' living conditions -- giving them new toys to explore and a bigger cage to live in -- levels of this brain chemical increased and they became less anxious. ""The levels of this brain chemical increased in response to the experiences that the rats were exposed to. It also decreased their anxiety"". Javier Perez of the University of Michigan said in a telephone interview. ""It made them behave the same way as the rats that were relaxed"", he said. In a former study of people who were severely depressed before they died, the team found the gene that makes FGF2 was producing very low levels of the growth factor, which is known primarily for organizing the brain during development and repairing it after injury. Perez thinks the brain chemical may be a marker for genetic vulnerability to anxiety and depression. But it can also respond to changes in the environment in a positive way, possibly by preserving new brain cells. While both the calm and anxious rats produced the same number of new brain cells, these cells were less likely to survive in the high-anxiety rats, the team found. Giving the rats better living conditions or injecting them with FGF2 helped improve cell survival. ""This discovery may pave the way for new, more specific treatments for anxiety that will not be based on sedation , but will instead fight the real cause of the disease,"" Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza from France said in a statement. </s>"	Doctors may treat anxiety more efficiently. </s>
Question: Which of the following statement is true? Context: With about 10 million new iPhone 6s ordered in the initial days on the market, a lot of old iPhones are bound to be thrown into the dustbins. Sure, you could sell, donate or recycle your old iPhone, but you probably will not. And there are better things to do with it. One creative example: At the Missouri University of Science and Technology, a biology class is making old iPhones into microscopes. Using less than $10 worth of supplies, the old phones are mounted onto a lens and can magnify an object to 175 times its size. Here are 5 smart-and-cheap uses for old iPhones. Music for your car Take your music library on the road. Some cars are equipped with docking ports for iPhones and have dashboard screens so you can choose your favourite music hands-free. Or you can just use the cigarette lighter for power. Remote Control Televisions, speakers and other devices now have apps that allow users to make their iPhones into fashionable remotes. Carm Lyman, 42, of Napa, California, transformed his iPhone 4 into a remote for his household sound system after his iPhone 5 arrived. Lyman can control the audio levels and activate speakers in various parts of his home as well as access different music services. Cookbook No need to go through recipe books or hunt around for other devices when you have a kitchen iPhone. Download a cookbook app, such as My Recipe Book (99 cents) or Big Oven (free), and just leave the device on the kitchen counter.

Baby Monitor Sure, you can spend $100 or more on a baby monitor, or you can just set your old iPhone up to watch video of your baby in real time as well as hear and even talk to him or her. Cloud Baby Monitor ($3.99) also allows parents to receive the signal on a wireless network or on WiFi so they do not have to be within a certain number of feet of the monitor. Vehicle Tracker Whether you need to find your car if it is stolen, record where you have traveled, or spy on your teenage driver, the built-in GPS in your phone can be used as a tracking device. An app like InstaMapper ($2.99) lets you watch the vehicle in real-time and have a record of it. Keep in mind that the phone can still dial 911, even if it does not have cellphone service, Smith said. You can also use your old phone as a back-up in case your new model suffers irreparable harm. That said, the battery of a phone that sits in a drawer unused could be exhausted to the point where it is no longer workable. </s>	An old iphone may give you clues about a stolen car. </s>
"Question: What's the most important factor considered in the assessment of risk music has to hearing? Context: AC/DC have postponed their US tour after singer Brian Johnson was warned by doctors that he was at risk of ""total hearing loss"". This is unsurprising, given the decades that the Australian band has been pumping out the hard rock decibels . But deafness isn't only a concern for rock musicians. In recent years it has become clear that anyone around music a lot has reason to be equally worried. When exposed to music, risk to hearing arises from a combination of how loud the sound is and how long you're exposed to it. If you visit a nightclub that is thumping out music on the dance floor at 100 dB, then after only 10-15 minutes the exposure is potentially damaging. In a quieter part of the club, but where the music is still loud enough that you have to shout at your friends, then you could be there for a couple of hours before having to worry about your hearing. Of course music frequently exceeds 80-85 dB, but what counts most in assessing the risk to hearing is the average exposure. Exposure to high noise levels often causes temporary deafness - something many people have experienced after going to a nightclub. While hearing usually recovers after a few hours or days, repeated loud exposure leads to permanent hearing damage. Initially, this damage is subtle and unlikely to be noticed by the listener. Problems only becomes significant in middle age when the noise-induced hearing loss combines with the natural loss of hearing due to ageing. Improved technology means that the number of musicians having to give up performing could decrease, but student musicians need to be educated about the dangers of noise-caused hearing loss. The increasing use of headphones will also work against this - for musicians and everyone else. Unless people are careful with the volume level on their portable music players, hearing loss caused by music will increase.

"Question: What caused the carbon monoxide spreading through the house? Context: For their nick-of-time acts, Toby, a 2-year-old dog, and Winnie, a cute cat, were named Dog and Cat of the Year by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. As Amy Paul choked on a piece of apple at her home, her dog jumped up, landing hard on her chest and forcing the piece in her throat out. When the Keesling family of Indiana was about to be killed by carbon monoxide, their cat clawed at the wife Cathy's hair until she woke up and called for help. No one could explain their timely heroics. Both pets were rescued by their owners in _ -----Toby as a 4-week-old thrown into a garbage bin to die, and Winnie as a week-old orphan hiding under a barn, so helpless that Cathy's husband, Eric, had to feed her milk with an eyedropper. As the Keeslings recalled it, a gas-driven pump being used broke down, spreading carbon monoxide through the house. By the time Winnie went to rescue, the couple's 14-year-old son was already unconscious. ""Winnie jumped on the bed and was clawing at me, with a kind of angry sound,"" Cathy Keesling said. The state police responding to her 911 call said the family was only minutes from death, judging by the amount of poisonous gas in the house. Amy Paul's husband was at his job when she took a midday break from making jewelry and bit into an apple. ""Normally I peel them, but I read in Good Housekeeping Magazine that the skin has all the nutrients, so I ate the skin, and that's what caused me to choke,"" she recalled. ""I couldn't breathe and I was in panic when Toby jumped on me. He never does that, but he did, and saved my life.""

"Question: What's the passage mainly about? Context: A baby carrier is like a backpack for carrying a baby. Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago. Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, ""Where can I buy one?"" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month. When Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things. Now all over the world babies ride in baby carriers, close to their parents, safe and happy. ,. </s>"	The mother of the baby carrier. </s>

When that proud father or mother asks you, ""Well, what do you think...isn't she beautiful?"" What are you going to say? Is this the time for the truth? Of course not! You look at that proud father or mother in the eye and say, ""Yes, she is! She is really a beauty. She's one in a million. She's going to be a movie star! I can tell!

Question: Why are Canadian officials placing chickens along the border? Context: Health officials in Canada are very busy these days. They are placing chickens at fixed points all along their 2,500 km border with the United States of America. It's not a joke, nor have the Canadians gone mad. They are using these chickens to see if the West Nile virus is still around. The virus infects birds, so the chickens have a chance of catching the virus and fall ill. The West Nile virus is spread among humans. It killed seven people in New York last year. Countries around the world are realizing that it may just be possible to stop certain kinds of people from entering their land. However, it is very difficult to stop viruses traveling from one end of the earth to another. When they travel to new places, they get used to the environment very easily and sometimes start destroying the local plant and animal life. These biological polluters are called smart polluters. These smart polluters can be carried across borders of countries unknowingly. Just as we humans are travelling across the world more often than earlier, these biological polluters have also started journey much more. They slide into airplanes through their wheels. They dig into objects that travelers may be carrying from one country to another. There are some good examples of how these polluters work. The water hyacinth of South America is blocking lakes in China and Africa. Tree snakes from Papua New Guinea are busy eating up some birds in the country of Guam, which breaks its natural balance. That's why the customs officials in many foreign countries prevent people from bringing in a small plant, or an object made of wood that is in its natural form. The customs officials have these rules because these varieties of plants are special to certain places. The plants have the power to spread new illnesses among native plants and animals. Biological polluters always create problems in places where they do not belong. They could be special varieties of plants, bugs or even animals. </s>	To see if the virus is still around. </s>

""Manchester has more fast food restaurants than anywhere else in the UK,"" he told Reuters. ""People are taking the easy choice --eating and then just sitting in front of the TV.""

Question: This passage is most probably _ of a love story. Context: A month went by in this manner, but a month was all I could bear. The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went. I had loved that woman -- still loved her -- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me. Whatever feelings I might have for her now, I had to see her again. At once. ... I knew Marguerite. Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion. Probably, she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting. But, seeing me back and coming face to face with me, weak as I was, she had sensed that my return had a purpose, and must have wondered what was going to happen. If, when I saw her again, Marguerite had been unhappy; if, in taking my revenge , there had also been some way of helping her then I might well have forgiven her, and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm. But when I saw her again, she was happy, at least on the surface. Another man had ensured her the wealthy life in which I had been unable to keep her. She brought shame both to my pride and my love; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered. I could not remain cold to what she did now. It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show coldness.

I arrived late that afternoon.Grandma had fixed more food than the three of us could possibly eat.She loved me entirely too much.The next morning, Grandpa fixed breakfast for the two of us.

"Question: John Simpson thinks that _ . Context: British potato farmers were angry and wanted the expression ""couch potato"" to be taken out of the dictionary because it harmed the vegetable's image. The British Potato Council wants the Oxford English Dictionary to replace the expression with the term ""couch slouch"", with protests being outside Parliament in London and the offices of Oxford University Press. Kathryn Race, head of marketing at the Council, which represents some 4,000 planters and processors, said the group had complained in writing to the OED but had yet to receive a response. ""We are trying to get rid of the image that potatoes are bad for you,"" she said on Monday. ""The potato has had its knocks in the past. Of course it is not the Oxford English Dictionary's fault but we want to use another term instead of ""couch potato"" because potatoes are naturally healthy."" The OED says that ""couch potato"" began as American slang, meaning ""a person who spends his or her leisure time sitting around, especially watching television or video tapes."" The Potato Council says its campaign is backed by dieticians who say the vegetable is low in fat and high in vitamin C. Supporting the campaign, famous cook Antony Worrall Thompson said the vegetable was one of Britain's favorite foods. ""Not only are they healthy, they are also convenient and yummy . Life without potato is like a sandwich without a filling,"" he said. John Simpson, chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, said the dictionary first included the term ""couch potato"" in 1993 and said ""dictionaries just reflect the words that society uses."" Simpson said words were never taken out of the full-length dictionary, which includes some 650,000 words in 20 volumes. But little-used words can be removed from the smaller dictionaries to make way for newer ones. ""If society stops using words then they get taken out of the smaller dictionaries,"" he added. The first known recorded use of the expression ""couch potato"" was in an article in Los Angeles Times, in 1979, Simpson said. Nigel Evans, a member of Parliament for the Ribble Valley in Lancashire, has made a motion in support of the campaign, highlighting the nutritional value of the British potato. </s>"	it is impossible for them to take the expression out of the dictionary </s>
Question: The author mentions Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy as examples of _ . Context: Every profession or trade, every art, and every science has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is partly to refer to things or processes which have no names in ordinary English, and partly to secure greater exactness in expression. Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular science or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula . Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, _ Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn. Most of the new coinages are restricted to special discussions and seldom get into general literature or conversation. Yet no profession is nowadays, as all profession once were, a closed guild . The lawyer, the physician, the man of science, and the cleric associate freely with his fellow creatures, and do not meet them in a merely professional way. Furthermore, what is called popular science makes everybody acquainted with modern views and recent discoveries. Any important experiment, though made in a remote laboratory, is at once reported in the newspapers, and everybody is soon talking about it--as in the case of the Roentgen rays and wireless telegraphy. Thus, our common speech is always taking up new technical terms and making them commonplace . ks5u </s>	fast expansion of technical words </s>

Question: What's wrong with Gabriel Muniz? Context: When your dream is to become a footballer, nothing should get in your way--even if you have no feet. Gabriel Muniz, an 11-year-old Brazil kid, was born without feet. Although his family thought he would have serious difficulties living a normal life, he started walking before he was one year old. His mother would go after him, expecting him to keep falling, but he never fell. It took him a while to make the jump from walking to playing football, but he did make it. And, in fact, there's nothing he loves more than playing football. In his school, the skillful youngster is not only the best player in his school team but also the captain of his gym team.

"Question: When the father got home , _ Context: He was a single father, raising a 5-year-old boy alone. He worried about his son growing up without a mother to care for him. One day he went away on business, leaving the child alone. He was worried about the child all the way, not knowing if he had eaten. But his child always told him not to worry. He went home quickly after finishing his work. When he got home, the child was deep asleep. He was tired out. When he was about to sleep himself, he was surprised to find an overturned bowl of noodles under the quilt. He spanked his sleeping son angrily:""Why are you so naughty, making the quilt dirty? Who will wash it?"" It was the first time that he had hit his boy after his wife's death. ""I haven't,"" the boy explained with tears in his eyes. ""This is your supper, Daddy."" In order to let his father eat dinner as soon as he got home, the boy cooked two bowls of noodles: one for himself, the other one for his father. He was afraid his father's noodles would get cold, so he placed them under the quilt to keep them hot.

"Question: The author entered the nearest restaurant to _ . Context: The cold wind cut through my enthusiasm as a tourist in Washington D.C., so I entered the nearest restaurant for warmth. I ordered a hot cup of coffee, and began observing people. Some people were having dinner in the great hall, which made me consider an early dinner. At that time, I observed a man seated nearby and, from his eager eyes, I realized that he noticed the delicious food. His tired body and worn clothes shouted, ""Homeless, homeless!"" I wondered how long it had been since he had eaten. I expected him to approach me for a handout . He never did. A silent war broke out in my head --one side was telling me to mind my own business, and the other was urging me to offer him the food. While my inner debate moved on, a well-dressed young couple walked up to him. ""Excuse me, sir,"" the husband began. ""We just finished eating, and our appetites weren't as big as we thought. We hate to waste good food. Can you help us out and put this to use?"" He gave the man some food. ""Thank you. Merry Christmas!"" the man replied. The man carefully watched his new food, and was about to drink the soup and eat the food seriously. Something that happened next shocked me. An old man, with pants, an old jacket and open shoes, entered the hall and walked to our direction. The man who was just offered the food saw the situation. Setting aside his meal, he stood up and guided the old man to the table. Then he put his worn jacket over the old man's shoulders. ""Hi, my name's Jack,"" he said, ""and one kind person brought me this meal. I just finished eating and hate to waste good food. Can you help me out?"" The old man answered gratefully, ""Sure, but only if you go halfway with me on that sandwich.""

Question: What did the author think of looking at a smartphone? Context: A recent report says we spend an average of two hours and 40 minutes each day looking at a smartphone. That doesn't mean making calls, but using apps and browsing the Web. Spend that amount of time staring at anything. Checked our email in a restaurant, shared a picture of the food when it arrived, or checked a fact during a conversation only to be drawn into reading more instead of contributing verbally. It's no secret our lives are being affected by our obsession with smartphones. However, never before has this phenomenon been displayed so vividly as in the short YouTube film I Forgot My Phone. Despite only being online for a few days, it's already been viewed more than 10. 5 million times. Ironically, YouTube's statistics show that the site gets a billion views per day from mobile devices, so a lot of those people watched it on their phone. The short film, written by and starring actress Charlene deGuzrnan, shows groups of people in various social situations, the majority of which are completely attracted by their phones instead of the world around them.

Question: We are told that in a typical family in about 1900 _ . Context: During the twentieth century there has been a great change in the lives of women. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived until they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and she is likely to take paid work until sixty. This important change in women's life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls left school and took a full-time job. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school-leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women marry younger, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-time or part-time work. Such changes have produced a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life. </s>	four or five children died when they were five </s>
"Question: When talking about their culture, Samoan natives most probably agree that _ Context: Although the Samoan Natives have long claimed to be the indigenous people of their islands, holding firm to the belief that Samoans were birthed by special creation in Samoa, it has been theorized by many linguists, based on linguistic commonalities as well as archaeological findings, that migrants from Southeast Asia arrived in the Samoan Islands approximately 3500 years ago, settling in what has come to be known as ""Polynesia"" further to the east. Early contact with Europeans was established in the 18th century. Christianity was formally introduced with the arrival of missionaries in August 1830. During the early 20th century the Samoan Islands were divided by Germany, Great Britain and the USA. Tutuila and Aunu'u islands were claimed by the USA. The western islands became German Samoa. In 1914, New Zealand forces captured the islands from Germany, thus becoming Western Samoa. Western Samoa regained its independence on January 1, 1962. Samoans are notable in rugby. Despite its small population, the island of American Samoa produces disproportionately a large number of world-class American football players. Samoan Mosi Tatupu was a member of NFL team the New England Patriots. Samoan Troy Polamalu was a member of the NFL team the Pittsburgh Steelers until he retired after the 2014 football season. Traditional Samoan tattoo proves the strong ties many Samoans feel for their culture. Samoans have practiced the art of tattooing for over 2,000 years. To this day, a man's tattoo widely covers from mid-back, down the sides, to the knees. A woman's tattoo is not quite as wide or heavy. The geometric patterns are based on ancient designs, and often indicate rank and status. Here is the process of tattooing. The tattoo master dips his cutting tools into black ink made from burnt shells, and then punctures designs into the skin. The cutting tool consists of a short piece of bamboo or light wood with a piece of tortoiseshell bound at right angles at one end. A little bone comb is bound to the lower broad end of the tortoiseshell. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. The process takes days, and is sometimes partially accomplished over longer periods, with recovery in between. </s>"	Tattoo-receiving recovers slowly but necessarily </s>

She managed to whisper the word ""bear"" to her rescuer. The girl suffered serious head, neck and leg wounds. Now she is in a dangerous condition in hospital. The girl was taking part in a 24-hour race through Bicentennial Park in Alaska when she was attacked by the bear. Bicentennial Park is next to Chugach State Park where some wild animals live. The animal attacked the girl in a heavily wooded area at about 1:30 am. The girl called emergency services but she was unable to say any word. Another rider Peter Basinger found her lying unconscious on the ground. He told the Anchorage Daily News that she managed to say the word ""bear"" when he stopped to help. Her helmet had been ripped off in the attack and rolled into the woods. Mr. Basinger waited with the girl for about 20 minutes until doctors arrived. Armed police trekked 3 km with doctors to pick up the girl. Animal expert Rick Sinnott said something must be done as soon as possible to prevent the bear from attacking people again. ""It was extremely terrifying,"" he said. Mr. Sinnott told the Anchorage Daily News that the bear might be a mother. It hurt two runners on a nearby path two weeks ago. He also said that the girl was lucky to have been wearing a bike helmet because the bear had bitten her head several times. </s>"	she was then wearing a bike helmet </s>

"Question: What message is conveyed through the story? Context: In 1945, a 12-year-old boy saw something in a shop window that set his heart racing. But the price-five dollars-was far beyond Reuben Earle's means. Five dollars would buy almost a week's groceries for his family. Reuben couldn't ask his father for the money. Everything his father made through fishing went to her mother, Dora, who struggled to feed and clothe their five children. Nevertheless, he opened the shop's weathered door and went inside. Standing proud and straight in his flour-sack shirt and washed-out trousers, he told the shopkeeper what he wanted, adding ,""But I don't have the money right now. Can you please hold it for me for some time?"" ""I'll try,""the shopkeeper smiled.""Folks around here don't usually have that kind of money to spend on things. It should keep for a while."" Reuben respectfully touched his worn cap and walked out. He would raise the money and not tell anybody. On hearing the sound of hammering from a side street, Reuben suddenly had an idea. People built their own homes in Bay Roberts, using nails purchased in sacks from a local factory. Sometimes the used sacks were disposed of at the construction site, and Reuben knew he could sell them back to the factory for five cents a piece. That day he found two sacks, which he sold to the man in charge of packing nails. The boy's hand tightly clutched the five-cent pieces as he ran the two kilometers home. Near his house stood an ancient barn. Reuben found a rusty soda tin and dropped his coins inside. Then he climbed into it and hid the tin beneath a pile of hay. It was dinnertime when Reuben got home. His father was ready to serve dinner as Reuben took his place at the table. He looked at his mother and smiled. Slim and beautiful, she was the center of the home, the glue that held it together. Her chores were never-ending, but she was happy as her family and their well-being were her highest priority. Every day after chores and school, Reuben _ the town, collecting the nail sacks. Summer vacation came, and no student was more delighted than Reuben. Now he would have more time for his mission. All summer long, despite chores at home weeding and watering the garden, cutting wood and fetching water -- Reuben kept to his secret task. Then all too soon fall arrived, and the winds blew cold and gusty from the bay. Reuben wandered the streets, diligently searching for his treasures. Often he was cold, tired and hungry, but the thought of the object in the shop window sustained him. Sometimes his mother would ask:""Reuben, where were you? We were waiting for you to have dinner."" ""Playing, Mum. Sorry."" Dora would look at his face and shake her head. Boys. Finally the time had come! He ran into the barn, climbed to the hayloft and uncovered the tin can. He poured the coins out and began to count. Then he counted again. He needed 20 cents more. Could there be any sacks left anywhere in town? He had to find out and sell them before the day ended. Reuben ran down Water Street. The shadows were lengthening when Reuben arrived at the factory. The sack buyer was about to lock up. ""Mister! Please don't close up yet."" The man turned and saw Reuben, dirty and sweat stained. ""Come back tomorrow, boy."" ""Please, Mister. I have to sell the sacks now -- please.""The man heard a tremor in Reuben's voice and could tell he was close to tears. ""Why do you need this money so badly?"" ""It's a secret."" The man took the sacks, reached into his pocket and put four coins in Reuben's hand. Reuben murmured a thank you and ran home. Then, clutching the tin can, he headed for the shop. ""I have the money,""he solemnly told the owner. The man went to the window and retrieved Reuben's treasure. He wiped the dust off and gently wrapped it in brown paper. Then he placed the parcel in Reuben's hands. Racing home, Reuben burst through the front door. His mother was busy in the kitchen. ""Here, Mum! Here!""Reuben exclaimed as he ran to her side. He placed a small box in her work-roughened hand. She unwrapped it carefully, to save the paper. A blue-velvet jewel box appeared. Dora lifted the lid, tears beginning to blur her vision. In gold lettering on a small, almond-shaped brooch was the word ""Mother"". It was Mother's Day, 1946. Dora had never received such a gift; she had no finery except her wedding ring. Speechless, she smiled radiantly and gathered her son into her arms. </s>"	Where there is a will, there is a way. </s>
"Question: The passage is mainly about _ . Context: Everyone wants to know the secrets of a long and healthy life. Here are some discoveries from health experts. Many studies looking into the lives of centenarians look at what they eat. Many people who live into their hundreds live in the Mediterranean , so their diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, gets a lot of attention. The diet has been linked to a healthier older age, lower risk for heart disease, and even protection against memory loss. Education is related to a longer life. A 2012 report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics found that people with a bachelor's degree or higher live about nine years longer than people who don't graduate high school. James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, is also a supporter of the argument for staying in school for better life expectancy. His findings show education should be an even bigger factor than race and income. Educated people are more likely to land better jobs, plan for their future, and make healthier lifestyle choices. Being a hard worker doesn't necessarily mean job-stress will harm you. The Longevity Study found that plenty of hard workers lived long lives. ""Skeptics may wonder if hard workers really are enjoying life."" the authors write, ""We found that productive, hardworking people (even in old age) are not stressed or miserable, but tend to be happier, healthier, and more socially connected than their less productive peers."" Having a strong social group is associated with a longer life. We often turn to friends and family for support, and taking care of the people that matter to us may help us take better care of ourselves, some evidence shows. Some research even suggests that immune function is improved when we are around our friends, and that they help with stress management. Research shows that sitting for long period of time put people at risk for shorter lifespans and other health risks. A 2011 study found that each hour people spent sitting down and watching TV after age 25 was linked to 22 minutes from their overall life expectancy. </s>"	some discoveries on health </s>

"Question: The huge number of celebrity-focused publications reveals that _ . Context: It's difficult not to become involved in gossip at work. After all, people like gossip and interesting bits of information: you only have to look at the number of celebrity-focused publications to realize that we have a huge appetite for discussing other people's lives. At work, however, this type of interaction is harmful and costly. It wastes time, damages reputations, promotes divisiveness , creates anxiety. Rumors often grow because people like to be ""in the know."" Knowledge is power, and that's why the people with the least amount of power in an organization can often be the ones to start and spread rumors. It can make them feel important if they're seen to know things that others don't. This knowledge is at the center of why and how rumors start and spread. Insufficient knowledge or incomplete information are often to blame. Consider these examples: *People don't know why a colleague was fired, so they make up a reason based on some limited knowledge or insignificant fact. ""I saw John override the cash register the other day without a supervisor present. Maybe he stole some money and that's why he went."" *People see a pattern of behavior between two individuals and they add their own explanation. ""Joseph and Samantha spend a lot of time together after hours 'catching up on paperwork.' And just yesterday, they were sitting awfully close to each other in the meeting. I bet paperwork isn't all that's getting done after work!"" These rumors are typical of the things you'll face at work, and they spread because of a lack of accurate information. So, the best way to fight rumors is with good communication. When you communicate well, your team knows what's happening, and they trust that you'll keep them informed. Good communication within your team also means that you will become aware of any rumors that are starting, and you'll be able to address them quickly and effectively. </s>"	people like discussing other people's lives </s>
Question: What does this passage mainly talk about? Context: At the age of 16, Clara Barton was advised to become a teacher since she was quite shy.

She saw that these communities needed _ education for their citizens, and she took action by creating a free school, one of the first in her state. But later, ignoring her, officials named a male instead as the head teacher. Disappointed, she left her job and moved to Washington D.C., becoming the first woman employed by the US Patent Office. Clara Barton was forever changed by her experience with the army in the Civil War. She saw doctors use leaves when dealing with injuries since they had nothing else.

But new research suggests 89 per cent of print disabled pupils and their parents are unaware of software which changes standard print into other substitutes like combined text and audio files which can be read or listened to. Sir Steve has teamed up with software company Dolphin Computer Access to raise awareness of software turning tools.

I loved my small special class more than any group I had taught in the past. They were hungry for knowledge and I was enjoying teaching. Other teachers had told me that our children were from poor families and not to expect any child to bring a Christmas gift. In fact, I wasn't expecting any gifts. Imagine my surprise when every child brought me a gift on the day before our holiday break. First, I got a much-loved toy monkey from a shy girl.

Question: The best title for the passage is _ . Context: Scientific discoveries have changed man's life a great deal during the past century. First of all, they have greatly improved material well-being in several areas of life. In the field of medicine, cures for life threatening diseases have enabled people to live longer. In communication, the telephone and e-mail have made it possible for us to communicate with anyone in the world without leaving our homes or offices. Advances in transportation allow businessmen to fly across the ocean in the morning and return home the same evening. Space technology has put men on the moon. More efficient ways of using available resources, such as coal and solar power, have been explored. Scientific discoveries have also changed man's moral atmosphere. Ethical issues are raised by these discoveries. Should we keep a terminally ill person alive through drugs and machines or should we allow him to die in dignity? With advances in transportation had come the problem of pollution for nearly every major city in the world. If cities become uninhabitable, then such technical advances may come with too great a price to pay. Many people also question the wisdom of sending men to the moon when there are urgent problems that have not been solved on earth. During future years, increasing attention must be given to the moral as well as the practical applications of science. </s>	Science and daily life </s>
"Question: Which measure is not mentioned in the passage to improve road safety? Context: Turning left under a bridge in Beijing, Hu Xingxin, 24, suddenly braked to a stop in front of a yellow light at a busy crossroad. ""According to the new traffic regulations, running a yellow light is equal to running a red one,"" said the Beijing-based IT technician. ""Since the new rules came into effect I'm always ready to hit the brakes to avoid a penalty."" Authorities have since changed the rules and running a yellow light no longer results in a 6-point punishment. New traffic regulations are the latest measure to improve road safety, which has become a problem in China. Experts say that to achieve better road safety, various and comprehensive methods are needed. Updating the rules are only part of the story. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), traffic accidents kill more people around the world than malaria and are the leading cause of death for young people aged 5 to 29 -- especially in developing countries. Each year up to 1.3 million people are killed and more than 50 million injured in traffic accidents around the world. The economic consequences are also significant: according to a study by the World Bank and Harvard University, traffic accidents on average cost a country 1 to 3 percent of its annual Gross National Product.. The newly revised regulations impose much heavier punishment on drivers who violate traffic rules. Under the new regulations, 52 different violations result in penalties, up from 38 under the previous system. Eleven kinds of violations now result in the deduction of 12 points, compared to six points under the previous regulation. These violations include drunken driving and using fake license plates, as well as driving without a valid license. But traffic regulations are only one aspect of many regarding problems with road safety in China. Other components of road safety include technology and urban design. </s>"	More involvement of the government and organizations such as the WHO. </s>
"Question: According to Xie Xizhang ,the mainstream culture _ .

Besides"" Shanzhai"" electronic products, there are ""Shanzhai"" movies, ""Shanzhai"" stars and even a ""Shanzhai"" Spring Festival Gala, a copy of the 25-year-old traditional show presented by CCTV on Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve. "" Shanzhai"" has become a culture of its own,symbolizing anything that _ something famous. The phenomenon has caused a public debate over whether it is healthy or sick being a copycat. In southwestern China's Chongqing Municipality,a ""Shanzhai"" -version""Bird's Nest"" woven by farmers with bamboo attracts wide attention and the""Shanzhai""-version ""Water Cube""is popular with tourists too. Both are copies of the famous Olympics buildings in Beijing. Xie Xizhang,a literature critic,said that taking the ""Shanzhai"" Gala as an example, when the traditional CCTV program becomes less and less attractive to the audience, the ""Shanzhai"" version appears naturally to attract people. ""In spite of its poor techniques and operation, 'Shanzhai' culture meets the psychological demands of common people and could be a comfort to their minds,"" Xie said. Tian Huiqun,a professor at Beijing Normal University,said that ""Shanzhai"" culture never copies classic things,only trendy products. In that sense,it's like a computer virus, multiplying without meaning. Though controversial,""Shanzhai"" culture is becoming a widely accepted phenomenon.

"Question: According to the passage, birds often half sleep because _ . Context: Birds that are half-asleep -- with one brain hemisphere alert and the other sleeping -- control which side of the brain remains awake, according to a new study of sleeping ducks. Earlier studies have recorded half-brain sleep in a wide range of birds. The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere's eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once. Decades of studies of bird groups led researchers to predict extra alertness in the end-of-the-row sleepers which tend to be attacked more easily. Sure enough, the end birds tended to watch carefully on the side away from their companions. Ducks in the inner spots showed no preference for gaze direction. Also, birds napping at the end of the line depend on single-hemisphere sleep, rather than total relaxation, more often than inner ducks did. Turning 16 birds through the positions in a four-duck row, the researchers found that compared with 12 percent for birds in inner spots, outer birds half-asleep during some 32 percent of napping time. ""We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness at the same time in different regions of the brain,"" the researchers say. The results provide the best evidence for a long-standing assumption that single-hemisphere sleep developed over time as creatures scanned for enemies. The preference for opening an eye on the lookout side could be widespread, he predicts. He's seen it in a pair of birds napping side-by-side in the zoo and in a single pet bird sleeping by a mirror. The mirror-side eye closed as if the reflection were a companion and the other eye stayed open. Useful as half-sleeping might be, it's only been found in birds and such water animals as dolphins, whales, and seals. Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning. Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep. Jerome M. Siegel of the UCLA says he wonders if birds' half-brain sleep ""is just the tip of the iceberg."" He supposes that more examples may turn up when we take a closer look at other species. </s>"	they have to watch out for possible attacks </s>

Question: According to the author, fourth-generation networks and related devices_. Context: Since the development of the Internet, men and women have frequented the information superhighway for the purposes of research and social networking. Recently, developments in fourth-generation networks and associated communication devices such as smart phones and smart tablets such as the BlackBerry PlayBook have allowed social networking technology to take a giant leap forward. In this fast-paced world it is often difficult to stay in contact with friends, family, and coworkers, due to the fact that work and education often cause people to move to a number of different locations after spending only a short time in each place. Many people have accepted the fact that family members may only see each other a few times a year. Smart phones are equipped with their own wireless fidelity connections, which allow them to connect to Internet-based social networking sites. The BlackBerry PlayBook allows users to make hands-free telephone calls while on the go, and it has a host of other interesting functions. At the same time, PlayBook users can still surf the same old websites, and check e-mail through the Internet connection. However, instant messaging and e-mail are quickly becoming outdated because of the PlayBook's video chat capabilities. This particular feature makes the PlayBook an excellent choice for those families who find themselves separated over long distances. Someone once said that a picture was worth a thousand words. Thanks to the PlayBook's video chat capabilities, users of 4G devices can gain a measure of the physical contact that all human beings hope for, because of the device's ability to deliver the streaming real-time video to their users. Therefore, people can see the person they are speaking to, and read their facial expressions as well as their body language, while also hearing their actual voices in stereo sound . Based on this information, choosing to buy the BlackBerry PlayBook is one of the best choices that one can make. Use the benefits of this newest BlackBerry tablet to stay in touch with those closest to you. With the PlayBook, you will never be far from friends or family no matter where life's journeys might take you. </s>	have made a great breakthrough in networking technology </s>

"Question: According to the passage,people use euphemisms in order to _ . Context: A euphemism (from the Greek words eu--well and pheme--speak) is a word or expression that is used when people want to find a polite or less direct way of talking about difficult or embarrassing topics like death or the bodily functions.Most people,for example,would find it very difficult to say in plain language that they have arranged for their sick old dog to be killed.They would soften the pain by saying:We had Ruby put down or We had Ruby put to sleep.Many people prefer to call someone plain than ugly,or cuddly rather than fat. Euphemisms are an important part of every language,but it seems that English has an evergrowing number of them.The nonnative speaker not only has to make sense of the euphemisms he hears,he also has to learn which euphemisms are appropriate in any particular situation.He might be aware that his American friend needs to use the toilet when she asks where the bathroom (or restroom,or comfort station) is,but he is less likely to guess that his English friend has the same need when he says he has to see a man about a dog.He might have learned,for example,that in the family way is a euphemism for pregnant.If,however,he says to his boss,""Congratulations!I hear your wife is in the family way,"" he would be using an expression that is too familiar for the circumstances. Schools are full of euphemisms.At Frankfurt International School,for example,the special lessons given to students who are having difficulties in their school subjects are called Study Center (in the middle school) and Academic Workshop (in the high school).Teachers rightly do not want to upset students or parents by being too frank or straightforward,and usually choose a softer word or expression to convey the same message. </s>"	avoid embarrassment </s>

For a start,if someone is using your Internet service or downloading,this will affect your speed of access or download limit.Also,it's bad for Internet service providers.They will suffer in the long run because fewer people will pay for an Internet service if they know they can get it for free.And finally,just imagine this:what if the person who is stealing your Internet connection is involved in an illegal activity?I think the police are totally right to arrest these criminals. --by Sandra Wilkins Basically,if the person who paid for the service still has everything they paid for,what's the problem?It's just like using the light from streetlamps to read your book,or watching someone else's firework display.It's not stealing. Also,if you leave your wireless connection unsecured,then it is your own fault if someone else uses it.Just as you wouldn't leave your front door unlocked,or your car door open,neither should you leave your wireless connection open.By leaving your wireless connection open,you are inviting people to use it.Securing your wireless connection is as easy as clicking a few settings on your router .And finally,haven't the police got more important crimes to solve?They're always saying how they haven't got the manpower to solve real issues.But this is just ridiculous . --by James Hoarley </s>	Wireless worries </s>

"Question: People feel guilty for the deaths of their loved ones because _ Context: I had an experience some years ago which taught me something about the ways in which people make a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I had to conduct two funerals on successive days for two elderly women in my community. Both had died ""full of years,"" as the Bible would say; both yielded to the normal wearing out of the body after a long and full life. Their homes happened to be near each other, so I paid condolence calls on the two families on the same afternoon. At the first home, the son of the dead woman said to me, ""If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It's my fault that she died."" At the second home, the son of the other dead woman said, ""If only I hadn't insisted on my mother's going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride, the abrupt change of climate, was more than she could take. It's my fault that she's dead."" When things don't turn out as we would like them to, it is very tempting to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Priests know that any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out badly, they believe that the opposite course - keeping Mother at home, delaying the operation would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse? There seem to be two elements involved in our readiness to feel guilt. The first is our pressing need to believe that the world makes sense, that there is a cause for every effect and a reason for everything that happens. That leads us to find patterns and connections both where they really exist and where they exist only in our minds. The second element is the concept that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. It seems to be a short step from believing that every event has a cause to believing that every disaster is our fault. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. Psychologists speak of the infantile myth of omnipotence . A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and orders the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely outgrow that infantile concept that our wishes cause things to happen. </s>"	they believe that they were responsible </s>
Question: What can we learn from the passage? Context: No one not even its creators-thought that the world would care about the interwoven lives, loves and sufferings of a group of attractive and witty New Yorkers. But there's no doubt that Friends has become more than just a successful situation comedy--it has established itself as one of the last great television phenomena of the last century. Along the way, it has made its half-dozen lead actors famous. Looking back the strong friendship between the group of three men and three women who frequently gather at each other's apartments and at Greenwich Village's Central Perk coffee house, Friends was created by television producers, David Crane and Marta Kauffman. In 1993, the pair met producer Kevin S. Bright. Then the three became partners and got a deal to produce a new comedy for Warner Brothers. What they came up with was based on Crane and Kauffman's after-college years, when they hung out at the local coffee house and involved themselves in every aspect of each other's lives. It didn't take long for viewers to make friends with Friends. The sitcom quickly became a top ten hit. Critics loved it as well. Entertainment Weekly said the show operate like a Broadway show, with twisty plots and unique jokes. The television theme song has also been a success with the public. The song's success helped save the television theme song. An ABC executive was ready to order very short music intros on his network's shows, thinking that viewers would hit the remote control as soon as the opening started. But the success of the Friends theme song led the ABC executive to change his mind---remote controls or not, the TV theme song would stay. Years have gone by, but Friends remains and will remain an example of a modern day US sitcom that is both hugely entertaining television and nothing short o a genuine latter-day social phenomenon. </s>	The ABC executive thought highly of the theme song of Friends. </s>
"Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Context: You are what you eat and fats are a main food for Asia's fast-food generation. Dr.Chwang, director of the Department of Food Nutrition, says children are consuming more meat and soft drinks. That is a thorough departure from the traditional diet of vegetables and rice and little meat."" They like big pieces of fried meat with a soft drink. So although they may eat the same volume of food, their calorie intake has increased. Now that 40 to 45 percent of their calories come from fat,"" says Chwang. Although on the whole Asians tend to thinness, culture--namely Asians' hospitality--is a reason for the fatness of today's generation, according to Chwang. ""Asian people love food,"" she says."" Eating and drinking are important social and family functions."" In the past, however, big meals were only hosted on special occasions, as people were more careful with money. In today's climate of wealth and remarkable consumption,10-course meals are no longer reserved for significant occasions. ""In the past, people had four or more children--now, they have one or two, so they tend to spoil them,"" says Chwang. ""The earliest way is to give them quality food. Parents think feeding them well is showing their love. They feel bad when their children look thin."" When describing the physical condition of most overweight Asian children, Chwang says: ""there is a clear relation between fatness and indoor play. Children get fat because they don't move, and eventually, they don't want to move because they are fat."" Thanks to technology, a growing army of children prefer video games to old outdoor sports.

"Question: What can parents do to help their toddlers learn? Context: When children start kindergarten, evident gaps in science knowledge already exist between Whites and minorities and between youngsters from upper-income and low-income families. And they often deepen into significant achievement gaps by the end of eighth grade if they are not dealt with during elementary school. The findings suggest that, in order for the United States to maintain long-term scientific and economic competitiveness in the world, policymakers need to renew efforts to ensure access(n.,) to high-quality, early learning experiences in childcare settings, preschools and elementary schools. The researchers' study tracked 7,757 children from their start in kindergarten to the end of eighth grade. Researchers found that, among kindergarteners with low levels of general knowledge, 62 percent were struggling in science by the time they reached third grade and 54 percent were struggling in that subject in eighth grade. And general knowledge gaps between minorities and Whites were already large at the time when students began kindergarten. ""Children growing up in low-income families typically experience comparatively fewer early opportunities to learn about the natural and social sciences,"" the authors wrote. ""Their parents often have lower educational levels and therefore less science knowledge themselves as well as fewer resources available to direct the children's academic growth. Children raised in poverty often attend poorly resourced schools that futher limit their academic opportunities."" Morgan said that, within families, parents who regularly talk and interact with toddlers can point out and explain physical, natural and social events occurring around them daily. This might help youngsters learn facts and concepts that will prepare them to take better advantage of science instruction they receive during elementary and middle school. </s>"	Greate learning opportunities in daily life. </s>

Question: In the eyes of the author, the introduction of industrial life gives rise to _ . Context: Our quarrel with efficiency is not that it gets things done, but that it is a thief of time when it leaves us no leisure to enjoy ourselves, and that it strains our nerves when we try to get things done perfectly. In building bridges, American engineers calculate so finely and exactly as to make the two ends come together within one-tenth of an inch. But when two Chinese begin to dig a tunnel from both sides of a mountain both come out on the other side. --The Chinese's firm belief is that it doesn't matter so long as a tunnel is dug through, and if we have two instead of one, why, we have a double track to boot. The pace of modern industrial life forbids this kind of glorious and magnificent idling. But, worse than that, it imposes upon us a different conception of time as measured by the clock and eventually turns the human being into a clock himself. (This sort of thing is bound to come to China, as is evident, for instance, in the case of a factory of twenty thousand worker. The luxurious prospect of twenty thousand workers coming in at their own sweet pleasure at all hours is, of course, somewhat terrifying.)Nevertheless, such efficiency is what makes life so hard and full of excitement. A man who has to be punctually at a certain place at five o'clock has the whole afternoon from one to five ruined for him already. Every American adult is arranging his time on the pattern of the schoolboy - three o'clock for this, five o'clock for that, six-thirty for change of dress, six-fifty for entering the taxi, and seven o'clock for arriving at the destination. It just makes life not worth living. </s>	more emphasis on efficiency </s>
Question: What can be the best title for the text? Context: In all the world's cultures, people sing, play instruments, and celebrate with music. It plays such an important role in our lives that all fields focus on its study, including one looking at the biology of music. Experts are finding that because of the way our brains process music, learning to play an instrument or just listening to music can have a wide range of benefits. Music education has received a lot of attention. Learning to play an instrument can help children improve math, science, and language skills. One study in Canada tracked children's IQ scores for nine months, discovering that children who studied music had the biggest test score improvements. The secret may lie in the way reading music and playing notes uses several areas of the brain, increasing our ability to learn school subjects. For example, reading notes improves spatial reasoning skills, which are helpful in solving math problems like fractions . Music is also used for medical purposes, such as the treatment of diseases which affect memory. The secret lies in the way the brain processes music. One area near the forehead, the medial prefrontal cortex, connects music with memories stored in two other areas: the amygdale and hippocampus. That's why an old song can remind you of something that happened years ago. For patients suffering from diseases like Alzheimer's, listening to music can help unlock buried memories by strengthening musical pathways to memories. With the evidence of music's benefits pouring in, it's no wonder some countries make music study a part of their education systems. People are recognizing that more than just a form of entertainment, music is also great for the brain. </s>	Music and the mind </s>
Question: Mr. Perkin's new car is _ . Context: Mr. Perkin stands at the bus stop and watches the cars go by. Many of the cars are Beta 400s, and most of them are yellow. Mr. Perkin likes to do what other people do. So the following week he buys a new yellow Beta 400s. He likes it very much and doesn't like the old red one any more. This morning Mr. Perkin parks his car in a big park at half past eight near his office. But when he comes out of his office at five o'clock, there're so many yellow Beta 400s in the park. Mr. Perkin can't find out which car is his because he forgets its number and leaves his licence at home. He tries his key in some of the cars and people looks at him. He has to give up. Poor Mr. Perkin can do nothing. He waits nearly two hours until his car is the only yellow Beta 400s left in the park. </s>	yellow </s>
"Question: The writer mainly tells us _ . Context: If you are planning on traveling, there are few simple rules about how to make life easier both before and after your journey. First of all, always check and double-check departure time. It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting. The second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards , it is still important to have some local money in cash . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. ""Listen! I only take real money!"" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment. The third and the last rule is to find out as much as you can about the weather at your destination before you leave. I feel sorry for some of my workmates who travel in heavy suits and raincoats in May, when it is still fairly cool in London or Manchester, to places like Athens, Rome of Madrid, where it is already beginning to get quite warm during the day. </s>"	how to be well prepared for a trip </s>
"Question: There is no ""live"" on both pieces of paper because _ . Context: Once there was a king. He had two old ministers. One was kind and the other was bad.

Write 'live' on one piece and 'die' on the other. Then put them in a jar and tell him to choose. If he takes out the paper with 'live' on it, I'll let him go. If he takes out the paper with 'die' on it, I'll kill him at once. "" The bad minister was quite happy. He got two pieces of paper ready. He wrote 'die' on each piece of paper. The kind old man came. He knew the bad minister wanted to kill him. He also knew the words on the two pieces were both ""die"". But he knew what to do. Later the king had to keep his word and let the old minister go. Do you know what the kind man did about this at that time?

"Question: What does Zhu Yu say about customers who take away books without paying? Context: A busy public square in the Chinese city of Nanjing is home to an unusual experiment. For almost two months, the country's first ""honesty bookshop"" has occupied a sidewalk on HanZhong Road in the city's Gulou District. With no cashier or other staff, the store relies on trust for payment. Making money isn't the company's main goal and they don't punish those who take books without paying. ""If they can really finish the books, it doesn't matter if they took the books for free,"" Zhu Yu, the marketing director of the company says. ""In fact, we are really happy to witness so many people taking books from the honesty bookshop."" After browsing the four wooden bookshelves, customers must drop their money in a locked box. Prices are set at 30% of the usual cover price. Zhu hopes that his sidewalk store, which sells, on average, 60 books a day, will make more people interested in reading. Like elsewhere, e-books are affecting sales of traditional books, and traditional books and many independent booksellers are struggling. Zhu got permission from the city government to use the sidewalk and says he's determined to make it a long-term project. He says the store is open every day, except when it rains, and it's locked up each night. In September last year, the company laid out 1,000 books and reading lamps on the ground and encouraged people ""to go on a date"" with a book. ""Independent bookshops represent the well-being of the city."" Zhu told CNN in 2013, ""when a city is losing its bookshops, it's actually losing something in its soul."" If the success of the Honesty Bookstore is any guide, Nanjing's soul is in pretty good shape. </s>"	They are not doing wrong if they finish reading the books. </s>
"Question: What would be the best title for the passage? Context: Paul had just left college and was offered an interview for a position in a company in New York. As he needed to move from Texas to New York if he got the job, he wanted to talk about the decision with someone before accepting it. But his parents had died. He remembered that his father had suggested he should turn to an old friend of his family if he needed advice. The older man said, ""Go to New York and have the interview. But I want you to go on a train and I want you to get a private compartment . Don't take anything to write with, anything to listen to or anything to read, and don't talk to anybody except when you order the meal. Call me when you get to New York and I will tell you what to do next."" At first, Paul followed the advice closely. The trip took two days. As he had brought along nothing to do, he quickly became bored. He realized he was being forced into quite time - he could do nothing but think. About three hours outside New York City he broke the rules, asked for a pencil and paper and kept writing down the thoughts until the train arrived in New York. Paul called the family friend from the train station. ""Thank you, Uncle I know what you wanted. You wanted me to think. And now I know what to do.""""I guessed you could understand my idea, Paul,"" came the reply, ""Good luck."" Now, years later, Paul runs a company in New York.

"Question: From the passage we know that_. Context: Albert Einstein was probably the most famous scientist of the twentieth century. He changed scientific thinking in the modern world. He is generally considered as the greatest physicist who ever lived. What's more, he devoted a lot of his time and energy to working for human rights and progress. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting England and the United States, the Nazi government of Germany took all his things away, including his position and his citizenship. Einstein then settled down in the United States. In 1939, Einstein, who loved peace--afraid of a world in which only Hitler would had an atomic bomb --tried hard to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a famous letter to have the United States start uranium research. That Germany, after all, had no bomb, and that the first bomb would fall on Japan, could not have been expected. After the war, Einstein never stopped working for peace and reducing the number of soldiers in the world. Although he wasn't connected with any accepted religion , Einstein felt that trust in a personal God was too special an idea to be suitable to the God at work in this universe, but he never believed that the universe was one of chance or disorder. The universe to him was one of pure law and order. He once said, ""God may know everything, but he is not hateful."" </s>"	Albert Einstein gave up his German citizenship for political reasons </s>
"Question: Bringing sharks back is difficult because _ . Context: As dangerous as sharks may have seed to people after watching Jaws, which was released on June 20,1975, the recent disastrous decrease in their numbers show that people have proven far more dangerous to sharks. This disastrous decline is due in large part to commercial fishing of sharks. ""The market for shark fins in East Asia opened up thanks to changes in their economy, increasing their ability to spend money on things such as shark fin soup,"" Burgess said. However, the biggest worry for sharks and their relatives, the skates and rays, which are suffering a similar fate, ""is how they are killed incidentally when fishermen try and take other fish--the problem of bycatch ,"" Burgess explained. ""They may be thrown back afterward, but they're still dead."" The key of the problems behind bringing sharks back is that ""they're not the same as other fish,"" Burgess said, ""Sharks are slow growing and slow to reach maturity. Sharks are live bearers, which means females keep their young in their body just like us, but instead of nine months, it takes 12 to 18 months or more in sharks. Also, sharks generally can't give birth again until a year after they've given birth--sometimes they're on a three-year cycle. So once you get a shark population knocked down, this 'life in the slow lane' means that recovery is measured in decades rather than years.""\ Burgess said, ""I'm on the recovery team for it, but the recovery plan for that is over the course of 100 years. So I won't see them recover, nor will you, nor will your children. That's what it means when these animals go down--they're down a long time."" Any measures aimed at saving sharks must not only consider byeatch, ""which is the real killer right now,"" but also encourage interactional cooperation, Burgess said. ""Sharks are very migratory, and many species cross borders,"" he said. ""We can protect them only by getting many govemment to come aboard. That's the hardest part about this."" </s>"	their reproductive rate is slow </s>
"Question: What is the relationship between a new thought and its being put into practice? Context: If you look up the word ""create"" in the dictionary , you will find it means ""to bring into being, to cause something each of us does daily to exist"". We are creative whenever we look at or think about something in a new way. First, this includes an awareness of our surroundings.It means using all of our senses to become aware of our world.This may be as simple as being aware of color and texture , as well as taste, when we plan a meal.Above all, it is the ability to notice things that others might miss. A second part of creativity is an ability to see relationships among things.There is nothing new under the sun. The creativity is remaking or recombining the old in new ways. For example, we might do this by finding a more effective way to study or a better way to arrange our furniture, or we might make a new combination of camera lenses and filters to create an unusual photograph. A third part of creativity is the courage and drive to make use of our new ideas, to ask for them to achieve some new results.To think up a new idea is one thing; to put the idea to work is another. These three parts of creativity are included in all the great works of geniuses, but they are also included in many of our day-to-day activities.(257 words) </s>"	One may come up with a new thought, but may not put it into practice. </s>
Question: Whichof the following is NOT considered in the study? Context: They may be just passing your office, computer bag slung over one shoulder. Or they may be sitting in a car outside it, causally tapping away at a laptop. They look like innocent passers-by. In fact, they are stealing your corporate secrets. Drive-by hacking is the trendy term given to the practice of breaking into wireless computer networks from outside the buildings that house them. A recent study in the UK, sponsored by RSA Data Security, found that two-thirds of organizations with wireless networks were risking their data in this way. Security experts patrolled several streets in the City of London seeking evidence of wireless networks in operation. Of 124 that they identified, 83 were sending data without encrypting them. Such data could readily be picked up by a passer-by armed only with a portable computer, a wireless modem and a few pieces of software that can be freely downloaded from the Internet. The data could include sensitive company documents containing valuable information. Or they could be e-mail identities and passwords that could be used by hackers to log into corporate networks as if they were legal users. Most companies using wireless networking technology do not take even the simplest of measures to protect their data. Nearly all wireless network technology comes with some basic security features that need only to be activated in order to give a minimum level of security, for example, by encrypting the data being passed over the network. Raymon Kruck, business development manager at Check Point Software, a security technology specialist, believes this could be partly a psychological problem. People see the solid walls of their building as safeguards and forget that wireless networks can extend up to 200 meters beyond physical walls. Companies without any security at all on their wireless networks make it ridiculously easy for hackers to break in. Switching on the security that comes with the network technology should be automatic. Then there are other basic steps a company can take, says Mr. Kruck, such as changing the passwords on the network from the default setting. Companies can also install firewalls, which form a barrier between the internal network and the public Internet. They should also check their computer records regularly to spot any abnormal activity, which might betray the presence of a hacker. </s>	The number of computer hacking incidents. </s>
Question: Why does the author say that greyhounds make great pets? Context: Most people think of racing when they see greyhounds and believe they need lots of exercise. They can actually be quite lazy! Greyhounds are good at fast races but not long-distance running. They do need regular exercise but they like to run for a short burst and then get back on the bed or a comfortable seat. Another misunderstanding is that greyhounds must be aggressive because they are big in size. In fact greyhounds love people and are gentle with children. Greyhounds can live for 12 - 14 years but usually only race for two or three years, and after that they make great pets. They don't need a lot of space, don't make a lot of noise, and don't eat a lot for their size. Normally, greyhounds can be as tall as 90 cm. There is, however, a small-sized greyhound, which stands only 33 cm. Greyhounds come in a variety of colors. Grey and yellowish-brown are the most common. Others include black, white, blue, red and brown or a mix of these. Greyhounds have smooth body coats, low body fat and are very healthy. Because they're slim they don't have the leg problems like other dogs the same height .

Question: We learn from the passage that _ . Context: Some disabled people use a special card when they park their cars. These are called disabled placards, which are removable signs that can be hung from the rear-view mirror of a car. These placards are only supposed to be for disabled people. These placards are meant to help disabled people in a number of ways. They allow the person to park in special parking spaces. They can also be used when disabled people are being dropped off or picked up. Disabled people can even use them to park without having to pay. Parking officials think that some people are cheating. Not all people who have these placards are disabled. Today, one in sixteen drivers in California carries the sign. There are a lot more people who have disabled placards today than ten years ago. An official from the DMV says that there are many reasons for the increase. As people get older, they may develop health problems and need to have one. There are also other reasons why more drivers have them today. Finally, there are a number of people who have them that should not. Last year the DMV cancelled more than 25,000 permits. They found that lots of people who had the disabled placards had died. These permits are no longer valid. Some people are worried that the system is being abused. They are worried that access to the program could be limited because of the misuse.

In school you teach us not to fight with others, to work things out, to respect others, to clean up our mess, not to hurt other creatures, to share, not to be greedy. Then why do you go out and do the thing you tell us not to do ? You grown-ups say you love us, but I challenge you, please, to make your actions reflect your words."" I spoke for six minutes and received a standing _ . Some of the delegates even cried. I thought that maybe I had reached some of them, that my speech might actually spur action. Now, a decade from Rio, after I've sat through many more conferences, I'm not sure what has been accomplished. My confidence in the people in power and in the power of an individual's voice to reach them has been deeply shaken. When I was little, the world was simple. But as a young adult, I'm learning that as we have to make choices -- education, career, lifestyle -- life gets more and more complicated. We are beginning to feel pressure to produce and be successful. We are taught that economic growth is in progress, but aren't taught how to pursue a happy, healthy or sustainable way of living. And we are learning that what we wanted for the future when we were 12 was ideal and innocent. Today I'm no longer a child, but I'm worried about what kind of environment my children will grow up in. I know change is possible, because I am changing, still figuring out what I think. I am still deciding how to live my life. The challenges are great, but if we accept individual responsibility and make sustainable choices, we will rise to the challenges, and we will become part of the positive tide of change. </s>"	in his twenties </s>

"Question: What kind of product for hand-held devices does the writer discuss? Context: As hand-held devices such as smartphones are becoming more common, users are reporting some new physical problems. Florida chiropractor Dean Fishman began noticing an increased number of patients talking about neck and shoulder pain. He discovered these symptoms were due to the overuse of hand-held devices, particularly the action of bending the neck, and then _ the term ""Text Neck."" As if the painful symptoms weren't bad enough, Fishman warns that an untreated case of Text Neck could lead to permanent spinal damage. Other doctors have warned about ""iPad Hand,"" a condition that occurs when people use tablets like the iPad for hours at a time. Most people use their left hand to support the tablet and their right hand to tap or scroll. Doing this for long periods without changing positions can result in severe joint pain. In order to avoid or reduce the possibility of getting Text Neck or iPad Hand, use the following basic ergonomic principles: Avoid awkward positioning. Don't strain your neck, and stay aware of how you are positioned in relation to the device. Make sure that both your neck and shoulders are relaxed and that you aren't leaning over for a long period of time. Take frequent breaks when using any kind of mobile device. Many doctors recommend that users change their position every 15 minutes. When using a tablet, use a case that can support the device on a table or your lap at a comfortable viewing angle. Along with a case, use a separate keyboard with your tablet. This will be more comfortable since you'll be resting both hands on the keyboard. And since you won't be holding the tablet, you'll be less likely to experience hand or arm pain. </s>"	One for typing. </s>
"Question: What is discussed in the passage? Context: Not long ago, a rock band called the Backstreet Boys _ on the music scene. Young people everywhere loved their songs. One of the band's biggest fans was a young boy named Aaron Carter. Aaron had a special reason for taking such an interest in the band. Nick Carter, one of the Backstreet Boys, was Aaron's big brother. Even before Nick joined the band in 1996, Aaron loved music. From the age of two, Aaron spent most of his time listening to the radio. He sang along with his favorite songs. He made up dances to go with them. So Aaron's family was not surprised when Aaron decided to follow Nick into the music world. Aaron got off to a fast start. At the age of seven, he joined a band in his hometown of Tampa, Florida.

Context: Every year gray whales swim a 10,000 miles round-trip, from the cold waters near Alaska, down the coast of North America to the warm waters near Mexico, and back again. It is one of the longest migrations of any mammal. All day, all summer long, in the cold waters near Alaska, gray whales eat and eat.

"Question: We know from the text that scientists at the time of the Roman Empire believed in _ . Context: Renaissance is a French word. It means ""rebirth"". It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly "" reborn"" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist. People wanted to find out more about the world by studying it. This attitude of investigation had been common in classical scholars, and it was 'reborn' during the Renaissance. </s>"	what they saw with their own eyes </s>

Question: Mr Flowers stayed in or close by his glass-houses _ Context: There was once a man called Mr. Flowers, and flowers were his only joy in life. He spent all his spare time in one of his four glass-houses and grew flowers of every color, with long and difficult names, for competitions, he tried to grow a rose of a new color to win the silver cup for the Rose of the Year. Mr. Flowers' glass-houses were very close to a middle school. Boys of around thirteen years of age were often tempted to throw a stone or two at one of Mr. Flowers' glass-houses. So Mr. Flower did his best to be in or close by his glass-houses at the beginning and end of the school day. But it was not always possible to be on watch at those times. Mr. Flowers had tried in many ways to protect his glass, but nothing had been useful. He had been to report to the headmaster, but this bad not done any good. He had tried to drive away the boys when they threw stones. He had even picked up all the stones around his garden, so that the boys would have nothing to throw, but they soon found others. At last Mr. Flowers had a good idea. He put up a large notice. It was made of good, strong wood. It was some meters away from the glass-houses. On it he had written the words: DO NOT THROW STONES AT THIS NOTICE. After that, Mr Flowers had no further trouble: The boys were much more attempted to throw stoned at the notice than at the glass-houses. </s>	at times when school-boys were walking near them </s>

Question: In this article, the writer wants to _ . Context: Contrary to many people believe, highly intelligent children are not necessarily certain to achieve academic success. In fact, so-called gifted students may fail to do well because they are unusually smart. Ensuring that a gifted child reaches his or her potential requires an understanding of what can go wrong and how to satisfy the unusual learning requirements of extremely bright young people. One common problem gifted kids face is that they, and those around them, place too much importance on being smart. Such an emphasis can encourage a belief that bright people do not have to work hard to do well. Although smart kids may not need to work hard in the lower grades, when the work is easy, they may struggle and perform poorly when the work gets harder because they do not make the effort to learn. If the academic achievement of highly intelligent children remains below average for an extended period, many teachers will fail to recognize their potential. As a result, such students may not get the encouragement they need, further depressing their desire to learn. They may fall far behind in their schoolwork and even develop behavior problems. IQ is just one element among many in the recipe for success--Children develop well or struggle in school for a host of reasons apart from IQ. These include motivation and persistence, social competence, and the support of family, educators and friends. Because highly gifted children solve the most varied thought problems faster and more thoroughly than those with more average talents do, they need additional intellectual stimulation while they wait for the rest of the kids to learn the basics. Two central approaches are used to satisfy the educational needs of such children: acceleration and enrichment. Acceleration means studying material that is part of the standard subjects for older students. Enrichment involves learning information that falls outside the usual subjects. A child might skip one or more grades as a way of accelerating in school. But being with older children for the entire school day--and perhaps for grade-based extracurricular activities such as sports--can make a child feel inferior in every filed outside of academics. One very bright fourth-grader who had skipped two grades remained far ahead of his classmates intellectually, but as his classmates reached adolescence, his social and other shortcomings became painfully apparent. While acceleration is not an option, or not a good one, enrichment can be. After all, school is not a race but an adventure in learning. As such, the goal is not finishing first but absorbing as much knowledge as possible in the time assigned. Thus, providing opportunities for a child to study topics outside the regular subjects can be at least as valuable as pushing him or her through the required material faster. </s>	discuss how to bring out gifted children's potentia </s>

Context: Most American children eat potatoes every day, but they don't know which part of potato is most nourishing .Take a sharp knife and cut a very thin slice from it and hold it to the light, and you will see that the potato has skin, an outside rim and the inner part. The outside rim which is right under the skin is most nutritious.But this part is often thrown away with the skin. Even the skin itself is better for food than the inside. When eating a cooked potato, if you choose the inside and leave the outside, you are wasting the best part of it.

"Question: What is the main purpose of the text? Context: Does your school have any problems with discipline ? What happens when students _ ? Here are some examples of bad behaviour: * Playing truant (missing school without permission from parents). * Stealing, smoking, hitting, swearing, running, kissing. * Cheating on exams. * Calling a teacher or another pupil a bad name. * Not doing homework. * Not listening or not paying attention in lessons. * Wearing unsuitable clothes. Here are some of the ways that UK school children can be punished: * Exclusion : a pupil is asked to leave the school and not come back. The pupil has to find a new school or a different method of education. * Suspension : a pupil cannot enter the building or attend lessons until the school has a meeting about their situation. Suspension can last from one to 45 days. The pupil is usually given work to do at home with a special teacher. * Detention : a pupil is asked to stay after school and work for 30-60 minutes before they can leave. * Lines: a pupil has to write a sentence many times (e.g. 100 or more) on a sheet of paper, e.g. ""I must not shout in class."" Freya MacDonald, a 15-year-old pupil from Scotland, _ when she refused to accept her school's punishment. Her family says that she was given 11 detentions for trivial things such as having fizzy drinks in class and coming into school through a fire door. Freya says that repeated detentions ruined her right to an education under Scottish law and made it difficult for her to learn. So she refused to return until the school respected her civil rights. She wants the headmaster and her teachers to sign a letter to promise this. Hundreds of schools in Scotland were told not to use detention as a punishment because of her legal action. Many UK schools now give parents a home&school contract(,), explaining their discipline and rules. Parents must sign this document to agree that they accept the school's rules and discipline and that they are responsible for their child's behaviour. </s>"	To introduce how UK schools punish students with their discipline. </s>

"Question: Why did the judged ask Protagoras and Evalthus to come to the court one hundred years later? Context: Protagoras was among the great teachers of ancient Athens. He taught many subjects, including the laws of argument and the right use of language. It is said that he was the first teacher to accept money for his services. A student, Evalthus, heard of this famous teacher and asked him to give him lessons. However, Evalthus didn't want to pay for his lessons at once, and after some discussion it was finally agreed between them that Evalthus should pay only if he won his first case in the court. For if he won, it would prove that he had been taught well. The lessons began and Evalthus proved himself to be a good student. But he refused to pay Protagoras anything at the end of his studies. Protagoras therefore took Evalthus to the court and told the judges that he wanted his money. He explained that he must be paid whether he won or lost the case. ""Whatever you decide,"" he declared to the judges, "" I must be paid. For if you decide in my fovor , then I win the case, and so I must be paid . But If you decide against me, then Evalthus has won his first case in the court; according to our agreement, he must pay his lessons. Therefore I shall get my money whatever happens."" The Athenian judges found no fault in it, so they asked Evalthus to reply. ""No, it's quite clear,"" said Evalthus, "" that I need not pay. If the judged decide in my favor, then I have won the case, and I need not to pay. But if Protagoras wins, then I have lost my first case. Therefore, according to our agreement, I do not have to pay. So I need not pay in any event."" As both arguments appeared to be faultless, the judges were unable to come to a decision.

"Question: How long can't the moon be seen during the daytime in a month? Context: A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits ""raised area"" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. </s>"	28 </s>
"Question: According to the writer, which of the following is not true? _ . Context: For years and years people have been saying that the rail ways are dead. ""We can do without railways"", people say as if motorcars and planes have made the railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, that they lose money, and that they're dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, the railways have become highly competitive with motorcars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they are cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, it takes you from the heart of a city into the heart of another. It doesn't leave you as a plane does, miles and miles from the city center. It doesn't hold you up as a car does, in endless traffic jams. And a single train can carry goods which no plane or motorcar could ever do. Far from being dead, the railways are very much alive. Modern railway lines give you a smooth, untroubled journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep in comfort, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are traveling at speed at the same time? And we are only at the beginning,for we have just entered the age of _ . Trains are traveling at 150 miles an hour and more. Soon we will be wondering why we spent so much on motorways we can't use because we have not enough money to buy the oil and planes we can't fly in for the same reason. </s>"	When you get off the plane you will find yourself right in the city center </s>
Question: After getting out of the chained door, the author might feel _ . Context: The Great Barn Adventure One morning when I was 11, I explored the town's abandoned round grain barn . I found a chained sliding door that was wide enough for me to pass through. Inside, there was a heavy smell of dead mice in the dark. After my eyes adjusted, I noticed a shaft that rose all the way to the top of the barn. On one side was a one-man elevator with a long rope and roller. I stepped onto the platform and gave the rope a drag and the elevator began sliding up the shaft, but stopped halfway. After a brief panic attack, I noticed holes in the wall at regular intervals, forming a ladder. For reasons known only to an 11-year-old, I decided it would be better to go up than down. So, with shaking hands, I began climbing the wall. After what seemed like forever, I reached the top of the shaft. I stood up, dusted myself off and found absolutely nothing of interest. It was just an empty room with a ladder leading up to the roof. I climbed all the way up here for this? Then I noticed a fire extinguisher ,which I'd always wanted to shoot off. So this was the chance of a lifetime. I tried it, and, much to my surprise, the thing worked! It shot out a thick cloud of powder that instantly filled the room. I couldn't breathe. I was going to choke to death, and they'd probably never even find my body. Luckily, I remembered the ladder to the roof. I climbed up, popped the straw roof and saw a bright blue sky. I suddenly realized the dust and powder pouring out of the top could draw attention. So when the dust had settled, I climbed down and slipped out of the chained door. I'm not sure if I was more excited about being alive or about not being caught, but I ran all the way back home. </s>	relieved </s>
"Question: In which part of a magazine can we most probably find this article? Context: ""Benjamin Franklin,"" Walter Isaacson tells us at the beginning of his long (but never boring) new biography, ""is the founding father who winks at us."" By that, Isaacson explains, he means Franklin is the most human--and most modern--of the men who shaped the American republic. We admire Washington, Jefferson and Adams, but they remain creatures of the 18th century. The man we encounter in ""Benjamin Franklin""--funny, pragmatic and selfaware -- seems like one of us, or at least someone we'd like to be. Unlike Washington's cherry tree, Franklin's kite was real. His experiments with electricity made him one of the great scientists of his day. He was a middleclass businessman whose success as a printer and a journalist allowed him to retire at 42--and he devoted the rest of his life to his country. He was diplomat who persuaded the French to back the American Revolution and the author of the first great American autobiography. He was an excellent swimmer. There was almost nothing he couldn't do well, except write poetry. But what truly distinguished Franklin was his talent of being great and human at the same time. He owned slaves as a younger man, but in his last years became an abolitionist .When he fathered an illegitimate son, he acknowledged his fatherhood and took the responsibility of raising the boy. He seems strange today in the joy he took in compiling and creating all those self- improvement _ he published in Poor Richard's Almanac -- ""early to bed, early to rise"" and so on. Generations of lazy boys could have been happier without that. But he was no hypocrite . Isaacson tells us Franklin practiced what he preached, and often laughed at _ while he did so.

"Question: What can we learn from the passage? Context: When your pet meets your infant, it might not be love at first sniff. Baby's Best Friend When Jennifer Merritt brought her baby, Arielle, home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: ""If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!""says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. u Introduce Them with Care Your newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: ""Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell."" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. To introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. u Learn the Safety Basics No matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores). You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate. </s>"	The first introduction of your baby to your pet is important. </s>

You can use it in the street, in an aeroplane, a boat, or a taxi; you can call from anywhere on the globe to anywhere else. Calls travel at the speed of light, via satellites using ultraviolet, high-frequency wave bands and each communication is automatically billed to your account. This new phone is the size and shape of a billfold . You unfold it to use it., making it long enough to reach from your ear to your mouth. There is a miniaturized touch pad, on which to enter the number you are calling. There is also a tiny liquid crystal screen on which you can read weather, news or financial reports. These news items are constantly updated by the company that sells the service. Letter keys on the touch pad also allow you to use this electronic marvel as a computer or word processor. You can plug it into your large home or office computer in order to transfer any data that you feed in during a business trip. The PCN also stores any useful information of your own that you might need as you travel, such as the names, addresses and phone numbers of several hundred people, important meetings, flight details and so on. When you need information, you simply call it up on the screen. You can even use your PCN to activate electronically controlled equipment at home. For example, you could switch your oven on or off, start the sprinkler system in your garden during a dry spell, get your video recorder to record a show on television, turn off the central heating, and so on. All of this from thousands of miles away, perhaps from the back of a camel in the desert. Prototypes are already being trialed. In spite of the complex technology, they will be cheap because of the enormous sales that will be made. </s>	the new phone has excellent prospects in market. </s>
"Question: What is the author's purpose in writing this text? Context: One hundred and fifty years ago, the world's first underground railway began operating in London, running for just six kilometres from Paddington to Famngdon.Today, the network covers 408 kilometres, with 11 lines running through 270 stations.And despite every major city in the world now having its own metro system, London's is still the second-longest (Shanghai's is the first).It's no surprise that locals and travellers will all be wishing London's ""Tube"" a very happy 150th birthday. Londoners have an unspoken code of conduct when they travel on me Tube, and a bit of local knowledge is essential for getting around the British capital.Here we provide some tips and etiquette for your next visit to London. Do... Stand on the right on escalators , walk on the left -Londoners will be quick at reminding you should you forget this. Let other passengers off before getting on. Give up your seat if someone needs it more than you. Mind the gap (between the train and the platform edge) -they are sometimes pretty wide. Don't... Block doorways-move down inside the carriages. Talk to people you don't know.Even if the train is delayed you should merely sigh or shake your head, rather than strike up a conversation. Travel on the Hammersmith & City or Circle lines if you can help it-they have a poor record for delays and disruptions. Expect air-conditioning-the low tunnels mean there's no space on most lines to install air-con equipment so expect to set hot and sweaty in summer. </s>"	To provide tips for traveling by underground in London. </s>
"Question: People feel guilty for the death of their loved ones because _ . Context: I had an experience once which taught me something about the ways people made a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I officiated at two funerals for two elderly women. Both died a natural death. At the first home, the son of the deceased woman said, ""If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It's my fault that she died."" At the second home, the son said, ""If only I had not insisted her going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride was more than she could take. It is my fault."" When things don't turn out as we would like them to, we tend to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out bad, they believe that the opposite course, for example, keeping mother at home, would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse? There seem to be elements involved in our readiness to feel guilty. The first lies in our belief that the world makes sense----there is a reason for everything that happens. The second is the thought that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and calls the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely abandon that childish thought that our wishes cause things to happen. </s>"	they believe that it is their fault </s>
Question: What will Messi have to do in order to be complete in his soccer career? Context: Every time Lionel Messi breaks a record, it seems appropriate to compare him to the legends that came before him. In 2012, he rewrote soccer history on multiple occasions, and his latest record came when he scored his 86th goal of the calendar year, breaking Gerd Muller's previous mark, before wrapping up the year with 91 goals. All statistics indicate that Messi is currently the best player in the world, and that he will go down in history as the top footballer of his generation. But when he is judged against all-time greats like Pele and Diego Maradona, he still has work to do. We don't know whether the Barcelona striker will have another year in which he records more than 90 goals, but he must still sustain a similar level of production for the next several seasons. Messi has already taken part in three of Barcelona's victorious Champions League campaigns, and he played an important role in two of them. In order to firmly establish himself as the greatest club football player in history, he must win the tournament a few more times. Most importantly, the Argentine needs to win on the international stage. Regardless of what Messi does for Barcelona, his legacy will be incomplete if he cannot win the World Cup with Argentina. Both Pele and Maradona led their countries to the top of international soccer during their careers, and Messi's performances for his country have been severely disappointing. While he was still a teenager in 2006 --and his lackluster showing is excusable due to his youth--he cannot brush off the disappointment that characterized Argentina's performance in 2010. But the 4-0 loss to Germany in the 2010 World Cup Quarter Final seems to have sparked Messi. He scored 12 times for Argentina last year, and the next World Cup could finally be Messi's breakout performance in blue and white stripes. Due to all of his accomplishments, it is easy to forget that the extraordinary footballer is just 25 years old. If he can avoid injury or lengthy slumps until his speed and skills start to decline due to age, he may continue to break records and win trophies. </s>	He must win the World Cup with Argentina. </s>
Question: Which of the following is true? Context: What do you like most when you can get one of such things: freedom, true friends, love, honesty and so on?

"Question: The best title for the passage is _ . Context: The hole in the Earth's ozone layer has until now protected Antarctica from the worst effects of global warming. But scientists have warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3oC on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea level increase of up to 1.4 metres. In the past decades the western Antarctic has seen rapid ice loss as the world has warmed, but the other parts of the continent have, _ , been cooling, resulting in a 10% increase in ice in the seas around the region. This is because the hole in the ozone layer has increased cold winds in Antarctica, making much of the continent surface colder than usual. But now that the gasses that cause the ozone hole have been banned, scientists expect the hole to repair itself within the next 50 to 60 years. By then the cooling effect will have faded out and the Antarctic will face the full impact of global warming. This means an increase in average air temperatures of around 3OC and a reduction in sea ice by around a third. The biggest threat to the continent comes from warming seas. Robert Johnson, a scientist who monitors Antarctica ice sheets, said, ""The ice sheets in Antarctica are hundreds of metres thick. But once warm ocean waters start flowing underneath, the ice will begin thinning and could break up very quickly. ""Thinning ice sheets cause ice to break away from the continent and to melt even faster. Escaping ice from western Antarctica has already resulted in a 10% rise in global sea level in recent decades. Johnson believes that international action to reduce global warming is required immediately or it may be too late. ""Everything is connected - Antarctica may be a long way away but it is an important part of the Earth's system,"" said Johnson. ""It contains 90% of the world's ice, 70% of the world's fresh water and that is enough, if it melts completely, to raise sea levels by 63 metres."" Even in a worse-case situation scientists don't expect the ice to entirely disappear, but predict that, because of the melting ice sheets, average sea level rise will be around 1.4 metres higher by the end of the century. </s>"	Antarctica melting away </s>

Question: What is the proper title for this passage? Context: Another small animal that tigers eat in Ranthambhore (a wildlife park in northern India) is the porcupine .These animals are spread widely across India in open areas and grasslands; they often live in the earth and between rocks.They are good diggers, and in Ranthambhore are nocturnal ; they only come out at night.They weigh 12 to 16 kilograms and reach the length of 80 to 90 centimetres.They live usually on vegetables and fruit and seem to have a good sense of smell.Porcupines defend themselves when attacked by moving backwards with their quills upright, often making a strange noise. Several times, I have found the remains of quills where a tiger has killed and eaten a porcupine, but I have never actually seen the kill.In spite of the quills, experienced tigers will try to kill clearly by biting the porcupine's head, its weakest spot.But the quills are very sharp and can give painful injuries to young tigers.If the quills have gone in very deeply or if they are stuck in the tiger's paw, it will try to pull them out.Often, it will be successful, and the wound will get better.But, if the quills have gone in very deeply or if they are stuck in the tiger's neck or mouth, where they cannot be reached, the wound will often turn bad.If this happens, the tiger is in pain and is less able to hunt animals.It has to look for easier prey and so may turn to cows on the edges of the forest.From this, it is a small step to becoming a man-eater. </s>	A Tiger and Its Food. </s>
"Question: It Might as Well Be Spring is a song that _ . Context: Spring is a wonderful season to celebrate rebirth and new life. The long, cold winter is over. The weather is warmer and sunnier. The trees again have leaves and the flowers are blooming. The season represents hope, joy and beauty. At this time, many people think of this classical music piece -- Spring, which shows happiness. Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi wrote it in the seventeen hundred. However, not all songs about spring are happy. This song written and sung by K.D. Lang is about dreaming of spring in cold dark places. She recorded I Dream of Spring in 2008. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein wrote It Might as Well Be Spring for the movie State Fair in 1945. Frank Sinatra sings it. It is a feeling of restlessness or excitement brought on by the coming of spring. Richard Rodgers also wrote Spring Is Here, this time with Lorenz Hart. Ella Fitzgerald sings this song about feeling lonely during this season. Frank Loesser wrote the sad song, Spring Will be a Little Late This Year. Why has the season been delayed? Because the singer's lover has left her. Sarah Vaughn released her version of the song in 1953. By now you may be thinking, ""Enough with the sad songs, already!"" Ok, then how about a cowboy song? Gene Autry was one of America's most famous singing cowboys. He recorded When It's Springtime in the Rockies in 1937. And finally, we'll leave you with a sunny song called Up Jumped Spring.

"Question: It has been proved that no animal is able to _ . Context: A rabbit is running into its hole. You may ask, ""What happened?"" Well, when a rabbit sees something dangerous, it runs away. Its tail moves up and down as it runs. When other rabbits see this tail moving up and down, they run too. They know that there is danger. The rabbit has told them something without making a sound. It has given them a signal. Many other animals use this kind of language. When a bee found some food, it goes back to his home. It cannot tell the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance in the air. This tells the bees where the food is. Some animals say things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, each with its own meaning. But human beings have something that no animals have --- a large number of words about things, actions, feelings or ideas. We are able to give each other information, to tell or inform other people what is in our mind or how we feel. By writing words down we can remind ourselves of the things what have happened, or send messages to people far away. No animals can do this. No animals has the wonderful power of language. No one knows how man learned to make words. Somehow he learned to make them. As centuries went by, he made more and more new words. This is what we mean by language. People living in different countries made different kinds of words. Today there are about fifteen hundred different languages in the world. A very large English dictionary, for example, contains four or five hundred thousand words. But we do not know all these. The words we know are called vocabulary. We should try to make our vocabulary larger. Read as many books as possible. When we meet a new word, look it up in the dictionary.

"Question: Which of the following can best express the author's attitude toward objectiveness? Context: The newspaper must provide for the reader the facts,pure,unprejudiced,objectively selected facts.But in these days of complex news it must provide more; it must supply interpretation,the meaning of the facts.This is the most important assignment facing American journalists-to make clear to the reader the problems of the day,to make international news understandable as community news,to recognize that there is no longer any such thing as""local""news,because any event in the international area has a local reaction in the financial market,political circles,in terms,indeed,of our very way of life. There is in journalism a widespread view that when you start an interpretation,you are entering dangerous waters,the rushing tides of opinion.This is nonsense.

As for the first question,consider how a so called""factual""story comes about.The reporter collects,say,fifty facts; out of these fifty,his space being necessarily restricted,he selects the ten which he considers most important.This is Judgment Number One.Then he or his editor decides which of these ten facts shall hold the lead of the piece.This is Judgment Number Two.Then the night editor determines whether the article shall be presented on page one,where it has a large influence,or on page twentyfour,where it has little.Judgment Number Three. Thus in the presentation of a socalled""factual""or""objective""story,at least three judgments are involved.And they are judgments not at all unlike those involved in interpretation,in which reporter and editor,calling upon their research resources,their general background,and their""news neutralism "",arrive at a conclusion as to the significance of the news. The two areas of judgment,presentation of the news and its interpretation,are both objective rather than subjective processes-as objective,that is,as any human being can be.If an editor is determined to give a prejudiced view of the news,he can do it in other ways and more effectively than by interpretation.He can do it by the selection of those facts that support his particular viewpoint.Or he can do it by the place he gives a story-promoting it to page one or dragging it to page thirty. </s>"	He does not think there exists any objectiveness in news writing or reporting. </s>
"Question: Which of the following is TRUEaccording to the article? Context: THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. ""Things haven't worked out,"" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee. Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature. It's a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors. By Sasha Abramsky </s>"	The view from the mountain impressed the author's daughter. </s>

"Question: What can we learn about the operation? Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog. Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. ""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.

"Question: According to Sir Liam Donaldson, we should _ . Context: Doctors in Britain are warning of an obesity time bomb, when children who are already overweight grow up. So, what should we do? Exercise more? Eat less? Or both? The government feels it has to take responsibility for this expanding problem. The cheerful Mr. Pickwick, the hero of the novel by Charles Dickens, is seen in illustrations as someone who is plump and happy. In 18th century paintings, beauty is equated (...) with rounded bodies and soft curves. But nowadays being overweight is seen as indicating neither a cheerful character nor beauty but an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. So what do you do? Diet? Not according to England's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson. He says that physical activity is the key for reducing the risks of obesity, cancer and heart disease. And the Health Secretary John Reid even said that being inactive is as serious a risk factor in heart disease as smoking. So, having bought some _ , how much exercise should you do? According to Sir Liam Donaldson, at least 30 minutes of moderate activity five days a week. Is going to the gym the answer? Luckily for those who think that running machines are boring, the Health Development Agency believes that physical activity that fits into people's lives may be more effective. They suggest taking the stairs rather than the lift, walking up escalators, playing active games with your children, dancing or gardening. And according to a sports psychologist, Professor Biddle, gyms ""are not making the nation fit"", and may even cause harm. There's new scientific evidence that too much exercise may actually be bad for you. Scientists at the University of Ulster have found that unsuitable exercise releases dangerous free radicals that can adversely (oppositely) affect normal function in unfit people. The only people who should push their bodies to that level of exercise on a regular basis are trained athletes. So, should we forget about gyms and follow some expert's advice to reduce sedentary activities and increase exercise in our daily life? After all, getting off the bus a stop early and walking the rest of the way can't do any harm! One final thought.

The students study the basic traffic laws they must know to pass the written driving test, which is given to anyone who wants to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to sit behind the steering wheel and practice all kinds of skills that are required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive for a total of six hours. The students are divided into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hours. Thus, each student gets half an hour of driving time per outing. The instructor and the ""driver"" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. The cars for drivers' education are different from other ears. In this kind of car there are two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and the other on the instructor; s side. Thus, if the student driver runs into difficulties, the instructor can take over. This kind of car also has another special feature. On the rear window of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should be more careful because the student driver isn't very experienced. After the student has passed the drivers' education course and reached the proper age to drive, they can go to a designated state office to take the driving test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test.

The very first animal Wanda bumped into was Charley, a little green frog who sat in a pond by the side of the road catching bugs with his long, sticky tongue and croaking ""Baroomp! Baroomp!"" When Charley saw Wanda he jumped onto a lily pad. ""Hi,"" he cried. ""Witch way are you going? Ha, ha. That's a joke, Wanda. 'Witch way are you going?' Get it?"" ""I get it, Charley,"" replied Wanda, ""but it's not much of a joke. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. I have a surprise for you. You'll be so happy."" Then, without even an ""if you please,"" Wanda waved her wand, said a magic word, and poof ! Charley, the little green frog, turned into a prince! He was a handsome prince but a wet one. The lily pad had collapsed under his weight and dumped him into the water. Charley-turned-prince stood up and looked at his reflection in the water. ""Hey!"" he cried. ""You turned me into a prince! It's a surprise all right, but I don't want to be a prince. I want to be a frog! Change me back right now!"" ""Oh, dear,"" Wanda said. ""You know I don't like to be yelled at, Charley. Now you've made me forget the reverse spell. But who wouldn't rather be a prince than a frog?"" ""I wouldn't!"" cried Charley. ""I want to be a frog!"" He stuck out his tongue, missing a bug flying by the end of his nose. ""Look at that, Wanda! I was such a good fly catcher. And I had eyes on top of my head, too. I could see forward and backward and sideways all at once, but look at me now. With my eyes in front of my face, I can only see one direction at a time. I don't even have a castle, Wanda. What kind of prince is that? I'd really rather be a frog. Please change me back!"" ""I can't, Charley. But you'll learn to be happy as a prince. As for a castle, I can take care of that."" She waved her wand, and suddenly a castle appeared by the banks of the pond. It had stone walls, oaken doors, and pennants waving from its turrets. ""Your very own palace, Charley! You'll have servants, eat fancy foods and ice cream."" ""Bah!"" Charley interrupted. ""Who wants servants, or ice cream and fancy foods? I want bugs!"" He stuck out his tongue and looked down his nose at it, cross-eyed. ""This tongue is no good--it's too short!"" he cried. ""I can't even see it."" Again Wanda waved her wand. ""Look, Charley, musicians,"" she said. Out of the castle marched dozens of musicians blowing trumpets, tootling flutes, and banging drums. ""See? Your own band. They'll play music, and you can sing and dance and snap your fingers to your heart's content."" ""I don't want to sing and dance!"" Charley cried. ""And why would I do something as silly as snapping my fingers?"" ""Snapping fingers!"" exclaimed Wanda. ""That's it, Charley. That's what I forgot!"" She snapped her fingers, cried ""Upsi-doodle!"" and poof! The castle and musicians disappeared and the prince became a little green frog. Charley hopped onto a lily pad. He looked at himself in the water. ""You did it, Wanda. Oh, happy day! I'm a frog."" Wanda smiled and thought to herself, ""So I have to go back to school for another 103 years. Who cares? Charley's happy, and that's what really counts."" Well, it wasn't exactly 'Oh, happy day! I'm a prince,' but the principal of the Fairy Godmother Academy decided that 'Oh, happy day! I'm a frog' was close enough. Wanda hadn't thought about herself. She had only wanted to make Charley happy. Thinking about others was the most important thing fairy godmothers had to do. The principal waved her magic wand. Look! Wanda the Witch became Wanda the Fairy Godmother...sparkling pink dress, magic wand with a star, and all. </s>"	always care about the others </s>
"Question: Why will many commercial websites have a red ""Buy Now"" button? Context: Why is pink or purple a color for girls and blue or brown for boys? The answer depends largely on cultural values as well as personal experiences. To the Egyptians, green was a color that represented the hope and joy of spring, while for Muslims, it means heaven. Red is a symbol of good luck in many cultures. In China, children are given money in a red envelope to bring good fortune in the New Year. For many nations, blue is a symbol of protection and religious beliefs. Greek people often wear a blue necklace hoping to protect themselves against evils . People's choice of colors is also influenced by their bodies' reactions toward them. Green is said to be the most restful color. It has the ability to reduce pain and relax people both mentally and physically. People who work in green environment have been found to have fewer stomach aches. Red can cause a person's blood pressure to rise and increase people's appetites . Many decorators will include different shades of red in the restaurant. Similarly, many commercial websites will have a red ""Buy Now"" button because red is a color that easily catches a person's eye. Blue is another calming color. Unlike red, blue can cause people to lose appetite. So if you want to eat less, some suggest that eating from blue plates can help. The next time you are deciding on what to wear or what color to decorate your room, think about the color carefully. </s>"	To encourage people to make a purchase. </s>
"Question: What did Li Guang and his girlfriend Huang Minxia intend to do soon after the earthquake?( ) Context: When computer salesman Li Guang and his girlfriend Huang Minxia saw on TV the destruction caused by the unexpected earthquake,they quickly filled their car with bottled water and instant noodles and drove more than 160 miles to lend a hand. ""It's a small car,but we just wanted to help,"" said Li,from Chongqing,a city next to the hardest-hit Sichuan province. Donations are flooding in,more money than charities in China collected all of last year,and so are volunteers. In the week since the quake,donations have totaled $1.3 billion--85 percent raised within China. Many,like Li,are taking advantage of growing private car ownership and a new,expanding highway system to join the line of government and army assistance toward the epicenter. Across the disaster region,thousands of cars decorated with large handwritten signs--""Hardship comes from one direction,help comes from everywhere"" and ""For the people,for the Beijing Olympics""--were coming from as far as the capital,Beijing,more than 900 miles away. Private cars crowded so thickly on roads that the police set up donation drop-off points outside cities and towns to clear the way for army and government assistance.People living in tents along the roads posted handwritten signs asking for urgently needed items--water,rice,vegetables.Cars paused to hand out a box or two and then drove on. Instead of waiting for government-organized charity drives,people quickly acted on their own.Bank account numbers for making earthquake donations flashed on Web logs and mobile phones.Blood donation centers were overwhelmed by offers and began asking citizens to register in advance.

Question: Which of the following do you think is the best title of the passage? Context: The fact that blind people can see things using other parts of their bodies apart from their eyes may help us understand our feeling about color1. If they sense color1 differences, then perhaps we, too, are affected by color1 without knowing it. Salesmen have discovered by experience over a long period of time that sugar sells badly in greenwrappings , that blue foods are considered not agreeable to the taste, and that cosmetics should never be packed in brown. Their discoveries have grown into a whole subject of color1 psychology . Some of our preferences for color1s are clearly psychological. Dark blue is the color1 of the night sky and therefore connected with calm, while yellow is a day color1 connected with energy and encouragement. Experiments have shown that color1s, partly because they are connected with psychology, also have a direct effect on people's mind. People in bright red surroundings show an increase in breathing speed, heartbeat and blood pressure; red is exciting. Pure blue has exactly the opposite effect; it is a calming color1. Being exciting, red was chosen as the signal for danger, but a close study shows that a bright yellow can produce a more basic state of alarm, so fire engines in some advanced areas are now rushing around in bright yellow color1s that stop buses, trucks and cars. </s>	Colors and feelings </s>
"Question: Who first thought of the idea of helping those bored patients in hospital? Context: How do you feel when you stay in hospital alone? Jenny, 13, a US student, feels bored. She knows the feeling because she has been in hospital many times herself. One day, she thought of an idea--if patients could get some books to read, they would feel better. So, from May, she and many of her friends began to collect books for hospital patients. In six months the students collected 1,250 books at school. They decided to donate the books to the North Shore Medical Centre, a children's hospital next door to their school. ""There are books for kids of all ages, from babies up to high school level."" said Jenny. The students put the books into ""early readers"", ""middle readers"" and ""advanced readers"". Then they wrote their best wishes to patients on bookmarks and letters, put the books in big boxes and donated them to the hospital. ""We wrote things like, ""Keep on reading!' and 'Hope you feel better!,"" said John, 14, Jenny's brother. ""And we also wrote some funny things to make them laugh."" Frank, 12, and Steven, 14, helped carry 16 large boxes of books into a car. ""I think these books will make me a lot of patients feel happy."" said Frank. Steven shared his opinion.

"Question: Which of the following is the best title of this passage? Context: Growing up, I remember my father as a silent, serious man--not the sort of person around whom one could laugh. As a teenager arriving in America, knowing nothing, I wanted a father who could explain the human journey. In college, when friends called home for advice, I would sink into deep depression for what I did not have. Today, at twenty-seven, I have come to rediscover them in ways that my teenage mind would not allow--as adults and as friends with their own faults and weaknesses. One night after my move back home, I overheard my father on the telephone. There was some trouble. Later, Dad shared the problem with me. Apparently my legal training had earned me some privileges in his eyes. I talked through the problem with Dad, analyzing the purposes of the people involved and offering several negotiation strategies .He listened patiently before finally admitting, ""I can't think like that. I am a simple man."" Dad is a brilliant scientist who can deconstruct the building blocks of nature. Yet human nature is a mystery to him. That night I realized that he was simply not skilled at dealing with people, much less the trouble of a conflicted teenager. It's not in his nature to understand human desires. And so, there it was--it was no one's fault that my father held no interest in human lives while I placed great importance in them. We are at times born more sensitive, wide-eyed, and dreamy than our parents and become more curious and idealistic than them. Dad perhaps never expected me for a child. And I, who knew Dad as an intelligent man, had never understood that his intelligence did not cover all of my feelings. It has saved me years of questioning and confusion. I now see my parents as people who have other relationships than just Father and Mother. I now overlook their many faults and weaknesses, which once annoyed me. I now know my parents as friends: people who ask me for advice; people who need my support and understanding. And I have come to see my past clearer. </s>"	My Parents as Friends. </s>
Question: What kind of English is spoken on Special English? Context: On October 19, 1959, the first Special English program was broadcast on the Voice of America. It was an experiment. The goal was to communicate by radio in clear and simple English with people whose native language is not English. Experts said the goal was admirable, but the method would not work. They were proved wrong. The Special English programs quickly became some of the most popular on VOA. And they still are. Forty years later, Special English continues to communicate with people who are not fluent in English. But during the years its role has expanded. It also helps people learn American English. And it provides listeners, even those who are native English speakers, with information they cannot find elsewhere. Today, Special English broadcasts around the world seven days a week, five times a day. Each half-hour broadcast begins with ten minutes of the latest news followed by 20 minutes of feature programming. There is a different short feature every weekday about science, development, agriculture and environment, and on the weekend, about news events and American idioms. Three elements make Special English unique. It has a limited vocabulary of 1500 words. Most are simple words that describe objects, actions or emotions. Some are more difficult. They are used for reporting world events and describing discoveries in medicine and science. Special English is written in short, simple sentences that contain only one idea. No idioms are used. And Special English is spoken at a slower pace, about two-thirds the speed of Standard English. This helps people learning English hear each word clearly. It also helps people who are English speakers understand complex subjects. Through the years, Special English has become a very popular tool for teaching English, even though it was not designed as teaching program. It succeeds in helping people learn English in a non-traditional way. Individuals record the programs and play them over and over to practice their listening skills. In countries around the world, English teachers assign Special English to their students. They praise it for improving their students' ability to understand American English and for the content of the programs. Universities and private companies in many countries produce packages of Special English materials for student use. </s>	American English. </s>
"Question: According to the passage, the boy's father _ . Context: I grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona. I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced(,) at a nearby garage. Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late! I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me. ""I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason."" ""What do you mean? I'm telling the truth."" Dad looked at me again. ""When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car."" A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theatre and the real reason for my being late. Dad listened intently as a sadness passed through him. ""I'm angry, not with you but with myself. You see, I realize that I have failed as a father if after all these years you feel that you have to lie to me. I have failed because I have brought up a son who cannot even tell the truth to his own father. I'm going to walk home now and think seriously about where I have gone wrong all these years."" ""But Dad, it's 18 miles to home. It's dark. You can't walk home."" My protests and my apologies were useless. I had let my father down and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life. Dad began walking along the dusty road. I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would weaken. I begged all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he simply ignored me, continuing on silently, thoughtfully and painfully. For 18 miles I drove behind him, at a speed of about five miles per hour. Seeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing and painful experience that I have ever faced. However, it was also the most successful lesson. I have never lied to him since. </s>"	had already checked with the garage to see whether the car was still being serviced </s>
Question: The writer gives the example of the egg to _ . Context: Cars are lots of fun, but they could also be dangerous. We have to be careful when we drive them or ride in them. It's always a good idea to put on your seat belt when you're in a car. Why? Think about this example: You put an egg on a skateboard and give it a push. If the skateboard hits a stone, it will stop, but the egg won't. It will fly through the air, hit the ground and break. Now, think what would happen if you tied the egg to the skateboard. When the skateboard hits a stone, the egg won't go flying; it will stay safely on the skateboard. Volvo, a famous Swedish carmaker, was the first to use seat belts in 1849. Air bags are also very important for car safety, because sometimes a seat belt isn't enough. If the car is going really fast and runs into something, seat belts could even hurt the people who wear them. Most new cars have air bags in front of and next to the seats. When a car hits something, its air bags will come out quickly in less than one second to keep the people inside safe. </s>	show why it's important to wear a seat belt in a car </s>
Question: What's the writer's opinion on children's decisions? Context: Most parents hope that their children can be happy and successful. But do you know the most powerful way to encourage them to be so? The answer is to allow them to make their own decisions. Different people have different ideas about children's decision making. Unfortunately , most parents make decisions for their children--what they wear, what they eat and what movies they watch. In fact, it's not good for children's growing. Children should be allowed to make decisions when they are very young. But this doesn't mean they are allowed to do everything. For example, you shouldn't take your children into a convenience store and tell them they can have anything they want. They would be overwhelmed by the choices. But you can give them a choice among snacks. When children get older, expand the number of choices you give them. For example, allow them to decide the activities they want to take part in or when they decide to go to bed. The next step is to get your children to think before they act. Ask themselves several important questions. First, why do I want to do this? Second, what are my choices? Third, what are the results of the actions? After the three questions, they are sure to have right decisions. </s>	Parents should allow children to make decisions. </s>
"Question: We are most likely to find the passage in _ . Context: Let's face the facts. On most occasions, some things may seem impossible, but in every impossibility, there is possibility. Impossible situations don't last forever. While it might be impossible for one, it could still be possible for another. In a word, everything is possible. Someone once said, ""Success belongs to those who can look at challenges offered by the world as an inspiration."" So your challenges are golden opportunities for success. How can there be wonders if there are no difficulties? You need challenges to show your ability and success comes from the problems you face. Those who refuse to give in come out smiling. Robert X. Perez once said, ""The seeds of success spring from failure's ashes; failure is not defeat and it just directs you in the right direction. To fail is to understand what you should not do. Remember it and don't give up until your goal is achieved."" What should you do when you face difficulties? Jasbeen says, ""Yeah, life is difficult, but you shouldn't give up. You should have a positive and calm attitude towards all your difficulties and make the best of them. You may learn something new. You can accept failure and develop mental toughness. Mental toughness is to see the long-term pains rather than be put off by short-term pains. Once you have this toughness, you have an advantage of winning."" The only thing in life you ever really regret is the chances you didn't take. You will only regret when you are faced with the consequences of not taking chances and seizing the moment. Take every chance you can! Everything you've done in life may be good or bad, but no matter what you may do, you must try your best. You must do something meaningful and do it right now. </s>"	a speech for young students </s>
Question: What will people eat then according to the passage? Context: Life in 2060 Let us suppose it is now about A.D. 2060. Let's make believe(;) it is about sixty years from now. Of course, things have changed and life is very different. Voyages to the moon are being made every day. It is as easy to take a holiday on the moon today as it was for the people in 1960 to take a holiday in Europe. At a number of scenic spots on the moon, many hotels have been built. The hotels are air-conditioned, naturally. In order that everyone can enjoy the beautiful scenery on the moon, every room has at least one picture window. Everything imaginable is provided for entertainment of young and old. What are people eating now? People are still eating food. They haven't yet started to take on heir supply of energy directly as electrical current or as nuclear power. They may some day. But many foods now come in pill form, and the food that goes into the pill continues to come mainly from green plants. Since there are several times as many people in the world today as there were a hundred years ago, most of our planet's surface has to be filled. The deserts are irrigated with water and crops are no longer destroyed by pests. The harvest is always good. Farming, of course, is very highly developed. Very few people have to work on the farm. It is possible to run the farm by just pushing a few buttons now and then. People are now largely vegetarians . You see, as the number of people increases, the number of animals decreases. Therefore, the people have to be vegetarians and we are healthier both in our bodies and in our minds, and we know the causes and cure of disease and pain, and it is possible to get rid of diseases.

Question: Why has the UN come under increasingly sharp attack by Americans since 1985? Context: Even before World War II ended in 1945,many world leaders dreamed of a new organization that would keep international peace and safety,and encourage international cooperation .An organization was formed.The United Nations was to work to this ideal of mankind.

Question: We can conclude from the passage that the technology of Mettl is _ in the MOOC era. Context: Since American students have been introduced into the era of the Massive Open Online Course, the opportunity for cheating appears greater than ever. The all-knowing Google search engine is within easy reach. So how can a teacher handle such a large number of examinees so far away, let alone searching out cheaters taking tests across the Internet? Using technology, of course. While special services via webcam and cheating detecting software have been developed now, Mettl, an online company, has developed advanced techniques for netting cheaters, which the company claims are even more reliable and easier to use. Whatever small attempt to cheat, he or she will be found out. Mettl has adopted a mass of technologies on its test-taking platform, creating a mini monitoring state in an exam. Here's how it works: A test-taker signs on to Mettl and selects his/her exam from the site's library of pre-loaded tests. Facial and keystroke recognition technology confirm the person that has signed in is the very person, and the system records both the test-taker (through the webcam) and the test-taker's screen throughout the test. Mettl's technology uses the test-taker's webcam to detect how many people are using the computer. Soon, it will track eye movement well enough to sense whether the test-taker is looking away from the screen, perhaps to consult a smart phone or a friend in secret. Mettl also monitors the test-taker's screen and can detect when the test-taker has changed a computer or moved from the test. The system will soon be able to record sound, detecting whether the test-taker is talking or being talked to. If any wrongdoings are detected, the system flags the incident and reports it back to the test's administrator. This can bring any number of things, depending on the test-giver's wishes: a complete shutdown of the exam, a warning message that appears on the test-taker's screen, even human instructions from the control center. Mettl is hoping its technology will help it break into the country's big MOOC markets. </s>	promising </s>
"Question: From the passage we can infer that people _ . Context: On May 29, 1973, Thomas Bradley, a black man, was elected mayor of Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the third largest city in the United States, with a population of three million. About sixteen percent of the city's population are black. News of this election appeared on the front pages of newspapers everywhere in the United States. Here is how one major newspaper reported the event: LOS ANGELES ELECTS BRADLEY MAYOR UNSEATING YORTYBLACK WINS 56% OF VOTES Bradley called his victory over Yorty ""the fulfillment of a dream"". During his childhood and youth, people had kept telling him, ""You can't do this, you can't go there, because you are a Negro."" Nevertheless he had won a decisive victory over a man who had been won 43.7 percent. Los Angeles voters have had many opportunities to judge. Thomas Bradley had to form an opinion of him. The son of a poor farmer Texas, he joined the Los Angeles police force in 1940. During his twenty-one years on the police force he earned a law degree by attending school at night. He was elected to the city council ten years ago. At the time of the Los Angeles election, three other American cities already had black mayors, but none of those cities had as large a population as Los Angeles. Besides, the percentage of blacks in those other cities was much larger. Cleveland, Ohio, had thirty-six percent black when Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1967. In the same year Richard Hatcher was elected mayor of Cary. In Newark, New Jersey, sixty percent of the population were black when Kenneth Gibson was elected in 1970. Thus election of a black mayor in those cities was not very surprising. In Los Angeles thousands of white citizens voted for Thomas Bradley because they believed he would be a better mayor than the white candidate . Bradley had spent forty-eight of his fifty-five years in Los Angeles. Four years ago Bradley lost mayoral election to Yorty. This time Bradley won. </s>"	voted for Bradley because they trust him </s>

"Question: Why did Tim raise his head regularly?

Two 12yearold boys,Christian and Jack,rowed out a boat to search for a football.Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters,a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water.The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore.But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.

""Take that seat,"" Mr. McCarthy told the cocky newcomer Carlos,pointing to the only empty one , in the back of the room. Carlos laughed widely. ""But I need a couple of dictionaries."" The bell rang for classes. As I stood up to go, I saw Carlos coming toward me. ""I'm sorry I embarrassed you,"" he said . I looked straight ahead over the top of his black hair. ""That's all right.""

"Question: What can we learn from the story? Context: More than 700 years ago, Scotland was fighting with England. The King of England wanted to control Scotland. He had a strong army so it was difficult for the Scots to fight. They lost many times. King Robert of Scotland had to run from the English army. One rainy day, King Robert lay in a cave . He thought that he was not good enough to be a king. He was so worried that he didn't even see a spider near him. He looked up when he saw the spider climbing. It was trying to climb up to its web at the top of the cave but it fell down. ""How sad!"" thought King Robert. ""The spider is like me. It's not strong enough."" He watched while the spider tried again. It fell down a second time. ""Be careful little spider, or you might die,"" he said. ""Life is so hard. You'll never get back to your web."" But the spider tried again and again. King Robert watched while it slowly climbed back to its web. After an hour, the spider got to the web. ""You are such a great spider,"" he said. ""If you can keep trying, I can too. I must carry on fighting. I won't let the English win.""

"Question: What advice does the author give in the passage? Context: ""Did you hear what happened to Adam last Friday?"" Lindsey whispers to Tori. With her eyes shining, Tori brags, ""You bet I did. Sean told me two days ago."" What are Lindsey and Tori talking about? It just happens to be yours truly, Adam Freedman. I can tell you that what they are saying is (a) not nice and (b) not even true. Still, Lindsey and Tori aren't very different from most students here at Linton High School, including me. Many of our conversations are gossip . I have noticed three effects of gossip: it can hurt people, it can give gossipers a strange kind of satisfaction, and it can cause social pressures in a group. An important negative effect of gossip is that it can hurt the person being talked about. Usually, gossip spreads information about a topic--breakups, troubles at home, even dropping out--that a person would rather keep secret. The more embarrassing or shameful the secret is, the juicer the gossip it makes. Probably the worst type of gossip is the absolute lie. People often think of gossipers as harmless, bur cruel lies can cause pain. If we know that gossip can be harmful, then why do so many of us do it? The answer lies in another effect of gossip: the satisfaction it gives us. Sharing the latest rumor can make a person feel important because he or she knows something that others don't. Similarly, hearing the latest rumor can make a person feel like part of the ""in group"". In other words, gossip is satisfying because it gives people a sense of belonging or even superiority . Gossip can also have a third effect: it strengthens unwritten, unspoken rules about how people should act. Professor David Wilson explains that gossip is important in policing behaviors in a group. Translated into high school terms, this means that if everybody you hang around with is laughing at what John wore or what Jane said, then you can bet that wearing or saying something similar will get you the same kind of negative attention. The do's and don'ts conveyed through gossip will never show up in any student handbook. The effects of gossip vary depending on the situation. The next time you feel the urge to spread the latest news, think about why you want to gossip and what effects your ""juicy story"" might have. </s>"	Think twice before you gossip. </s>
"Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ . Context: Bursting into the classroom from recess , 15 children take their seats and face the woman they know as Ms. Yang. ""What day is it today?""she asks, in Mandarin Chinese. ""Confucius' birthday!""the fifth graders shout in Mandarin. ""Why do we celebrate Confucius' birthday?"" ""Because he's the greatest teacher in the history of China!""exclaims a brown-haired girl. She too is speaking Mandarin. English is rarely heard in Lisa Yang's class at the Chinese American International School(CAIS), despite the fact that few students are native speakers of Mandarin. The United States is actively trying to increase the group of students in""critical languages""such as Mandarin. The students at CAIS are way ahead in such a trend. Mandarin explosion in America Founded 25 years ago, this small private school in San Francisco, USA, does what few other American schools do: It produces fully fluent speakers of Mandarin Chinese, by far the most commonly spoken language in the world. Mandarin Chinese is suddenly hot in American schools. As China becomes the world's leading economy sometimes this century, schools in the U.S. are _ to add Mandarin to their roster of foreign languages or expand Chinese programs already in place. ""It really is almost unprecedented . People are looking at China as a force to be reckoned with...And to ensure that the U.S. has the ability to conduct trade, and to work with the Chinese, certainly having an understanding of Chinese language and culture is an advantage,""said Marty Abbott of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages(ACTFL) . Cultural differences in teaching styles To develop Chinese-language programs has not been smooth. A shortage of trained teachers has made it difficult for some schools to join the race. When schools do get teachers, they often hire them straight from China, and the teachers usually suffer culture shock when they come to the U.S. Robert Liu remembers his first two years in an American classroom. It was not an easy adjustment. ""In China, students respect their teachers,""he said. Liu found that American students, however, expect an active teaching style. He had to use games to engage them rather than lectures. To avoid many of the problems with foreign teaching styles, the CAIS has been working with the Chinese government to improve training of teachers who are sent to the U.S. </s>"	the students in Lisa Yang's class usually speak Chinese </s>
"Question: The author mentions Dr. Johnson's comment to show that _ . Context: It is widely known that any English conversation begins with The Weather. Such a fixation with the weather finds expression in Dr. Johnson's famous comment that ""When two English meet, their first talk is of weather."" Though Johnson's observation is as accurate now as it was over two hundred years ago, most commentators fail to come up with a convincing explanation for this English weather-speak. Bill Bryson, for example, concludes that, as the English weather is not at all exciting, the _ with it can hardly be understood. He argues that ""To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it."" Simply, the reason is that the unusual and unpredictable weather is almost unknown in the British Isles. Jeremy Paxman, however, disagrees with Bryson, arguing that the English weather is by nature attractive. Bryson is wrong, he says, because the English preference for the weather has nothing to do with the natural phenomena. ""The interest is less in the phenomena themselves, but in uncertainty."" According to him, the weather in England is very changeable and uncertain and it attracts the English as well as the outsider. Bryson and Paxman stand for common misconceptions about the weather-speak among the English. Both commentators, somehow, are missing the point. The English weather conversation is not really about the weather at all. English weather-speak is a system of signs, which is developed to help the speakers overcome the natural reserve and actually talk to each other. Everyone knows conversations starting with weather-speak are not requests for weather data. Rather, they are routine greetings, conversation starters or the blank ""fillers"". In other words, English weather-speak is a means of social bonding. </s>"	English conversations usually start with the weather </s>

Question: The best title for the passage should be _ . Context: Researchers in the United States have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company calledMicrochips began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company _ the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis . Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injection of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. The patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections. As a result, only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment. The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections and each section holds a single dose of medicine. The device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug. Doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone. For osteoporosis, the physician will program the device, and the device has the ability to release a dose at a given time, every single day. For other diseases, where the physician may want to change the dosing schedule, they will have the ability to wirelessly reprogram that dosing schedule. The seven women in the study were ages of sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the medicine amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves. </s>	Taking Medicine, with Microchip under Skin </s>

At a crowded stop, a young girl extended her hand through the iron bars on the side of our rickshaw to ask for some money. After we refused, or rickshaw driver started his remarks on giving. ""Giving is good. Every human should give. But we should know how to give."" The rickshaw driver continued, ""Most of these kids are trained by some guy who keeps all the money.

Question: It was Mr. Flowers' hope to _ Context: There was once a man called Mr. Flowers, and flowers were his only joy in life. He spent all his spare time in one of his four glass-houses and grew flowers of every color, with long and difficult names, for competitions, he tried to grow a rose of a new color to win the silver cup for the Rose of the Year. Mr. Flowers' glass-houses were very close to a middle school. Boys of around thirteen years of age were often tempted to throw a stone or two at one of Mr. Flowers' glass-houses. So Mr. Flower did his best to be in or close by his glass-houses at the beginning and end of the school day. But it was not always possible to be on watch at those times. Mr. Flowers had tried in many ways to protect his glass, but nothing had been useful. He had been to report to the headmaster, but this bad not done any good. He had tried to drive away the boys when they threw stones. He had even picked up all the stones around his garden, so that the boys would have nothing to throw, but they soon found others. At last Mr. Flowers had a good idea. He put up a large notice. It was made of good, strong wood. It was some meters away from the glass-houses. On it he had written the words: DO NOT THROW STONES AT THIS NOTICE.

Question: From the text we learn that _ . Context: Rhinos are big and can be dangerous. They are also shy and seldom seen. Once there were hundreds of rhino species, but today there are only five. One ancient rhino called Indricotherium was the largest land mammal that ever lived. It was 5m high at the shoulders, and 8.5m long-- twice the size of today's biggest elephant! The living rhinos are still big, averaging 2-3m long and weighing up to 3,600kg. To see all five species of living rhino you would need to do a bit of exploring. First you might visit Africa for a look at the white rhino and the black rhino. They live in Africa's dry woodlands and grasslands. Then you could head to India and Nepal for a look at the Indian rhino. It lives in the high grasslands near rivers, where you have to ride an elephant to find one. Finally you might travel to the rainforests on the islands of Indonesia to see the Sumatran and Javan rhinos. These are the smallest and rarest rhinos in the world and extremely difficult to find. Most rhinos are gentle and timid .They have a bad reputation for being very , but that may be partly because they get frightened easily. Also, they have poor eyesight. They rely on their strong sense of smell to tell them a stranger is approaching, but if the wind is blowing the wrong way, they may not know someone is there until it's too late. Rhinos can be found only in their habitats, which is why habitat destruction has caused rhino populations to decline. As they disappear from certain places, their absence leads to many changes to the landscape. For example, black rhinos in Africa only eat shrubs and small trees, pruning the plants and limiting their growth. Many other species benefit from this, and as rhinos disappear, so do many other animals sharing their habitat. Bushes and trees take over the land and force species like the antelope to leave in search of food. In a short time the whole habitat has changed. </s>	rhino numbers have declined greatly </s>

Question: It is stated directly in the passage that older people should _ . Context: There are many older people in the world and there will be many more.A limeknown fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries.According to the World Health Organization,by 2020 there will be 1 billion,with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people.Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net.

"Question: What does the passage mainly discuss? Context: There are many theories about the beginning of drama in ancient Greece. The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama came from ritual . The argument for this view goes as follows. In the beginning, human beings viewed the natural forces of the world, even the seasonal changes, as unpredictable, and they sought through various means, to control these unknown and feared powers. Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed rituals. Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the rites. As time passed some rituals were abandoned, but the stories, later called myths , coutinued to exist and provided material for art and drama. Those who believe that drama came from ritual also argue that those rites contained the seed of theater because music, dance, masks, and costumes were almost always used. Furthermore, a suitable site had to be provided for performances and when the entire community did not participate, a clear division was usually made between the ""acting area"" and the ""watching area."" In addition, there were performers, and, since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in performing, religious leaders usually undertook that task. Wearing masks and costumes, they often imitated other people, animals, or supernatural beings, and used gestures about the desired effect, success in hunt or battle, the coming rain, the revival of the Sun. Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities. Another theory traces the theater's origin from the human interest in storytelling. According to this view, tales about the hunt, war, or other feats are gradually added in detail, at first through imitation, action, and dialogue by a narrator and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person. A closely-related theory traces theater to those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds. </s>"	The origins of theater. </s>

It's not just folk stories that suggests Roquefort and Red Leicester (two types of cheese) give you nightmares. Scientists seem to agree.

When we're awake, this can lead to headaches. When we're asleep this gives us strong dreams. Cheese is also hard to digest and may make us sleep badly.

"Question: When learning English, we will _ . Context: In today's world English is the most wildly used language. It is our duty to learn English in the new situation of the reform and opening to the outside world. How can we master the English language? I'd like to give you some good advice. First, get interested in it. I enjoy listening to foreign friends talking when I was a child. At the same time I watched the English programme Follow Meon TV. From then on, I kept on learning English. The more I learned, the more progress I made. Second, practice makes perfect. Many people study English very hard, but they are very shy to speak it in public, for they are afraid of making mistakes. Remember you have to make a mistake before you can correct it. A native English speaker makes mistakes sometimes, too. Third, the beginners should be encouraged to pay attention to _ The English language has many idioms. For example, you should say ""He is as strong as a cow."" </s>"	not be afraid of making mistakes </s>
Question: Which of the following can be the best title of the passage? Context: We know music is very important in our daily life. Do you notice music playing at any of those places when you go somewhere? Today most stores, stations, restaurants and other places play music. You might even hear music in an office or on a farm. Scientists believe that music influences the way people behave . They think that the sound of western classical music makes people feel richer. When a restaurant plays classical music, people spend more money on food and drinks. When the restaurant plays modern music, people spend less money. Without music, people spend less. Scientists also believe that loud, fast music makes people eat faster. Some restaurants play fast music during their busy hours. This makes people eat faster and leave quickly. Restaurants can make more money in this way. Some scientists think that music makes you think and learn better. They say that music helps students to be more active. It is true that people learn better when they are relaxed. And listening to music can help you relax.[ The next time you hear music somewhere, be careful. It might influence the way you do things. ,. </s>	Music and Behavior </s>
"Question: What can we conclude from the text? Context: Sometimes having a teenager at home can be a real headache. Many teenagers smoke, drink, wear strange hairdos and even fight. Basically, they are often taking risks. Earlier studies have shown that teenagers are more likely to make _ decisions than people from any other age group, including children and adults. Is it that teenagers are too young to tell right from wrong? Not really. So what explains their risky behavior? According to Laurence Steinberg, a professor at Temple University, US, the reason is that teens care a lot about how their peers view them - that's the effect of ""peer influence"", reported Science Daily. As children enter their teenage years, they spend more time with their friends and classmates and also become more sensitive to their feedback . This sensitivity drives teenagers to concentrate on the short-term benefits of making risky choices and overlook the costs. In a test, a group of teenagers were asked to play a video driving game. When they played with their friends watching, they took more chances and drove more carelessly because that would increase their possibility of winning. But when they played alone, they tended to drive more safely. Why does pressure from peers have such a big influence on teens' behavior? As Steinberg sees it, a teenager's brain is like a car with a good accelerator but a weak brake . The ""accelerator"", the brain's ability to notice the benefits of things, is fully developed by teenage years while the ""brake"", the brain part related to controlling impulses and long-term thinking, is still immature . When teens are under the pressure of being judged by their peers, they tend to push hard on the accelerator. Given how weak the brake is, it is likely that they are going to end up in a crash. But the good news here, according to Steinberg, is that a violent teenager doesn't necessarily become a violent adult. About two-thirds to three-quarters of violent youth grow out of it. ""They get more self-controlled,"" Steinberg told Live Science. Also, people who haven't committed a violent crime by age 19 are less likely to start doing it later, added Steinberg. </s>"	The majority of teenagers become less violent when they grow up. </s>

"Question: What would the writer do when he had a failure? Context: I have been very lucky to have won the Nobel Prize twice. It is, of course, very exciting to have such an important recognition of my work, but the real pleasure was in the work itself. Scientific research is like an exploration of a voyage of discovery. You are continually trying out new things that have not been done before. Many of them will lead nowhere and you have to try something different, but sometimes an experiment does work and tells you something new and that is really exciting. However small the new finding may be, it is great to think "" I am the only person who knows this"" and then you will have the fun of thinking what this finding will lead to and deciding what will be the next experiment. One of the best things about scientific research is that you are always doing something different and it is never boring. There are good times when things go well and bad times when they don't. Some people get discouraged at the difficult times but when I have a failure, my policy has always been not to worry but to start planning the next experiment, which is always fun. It is very exciting to make a new discovery. Some people will do the strangest things for this excitement, such as going round the world in a balloon or walking to the North Pole. There are not many new places to explore but there is a lot of new information to be discovered in science and a journey into this unknown area can be much more worthwhile and just as exciting. I am sometimes asked, ""What do you have to do to win a Nobel Prize?"" My answer is: ""I don't know. I have never tried."" But I know of one way not to win one. There are some people whose main reason for doing science is to win prizes and they are always thinking about how to do it. Such people don't succeed. To do good science you must be interested in it and enjoy doing experiments and thinking out problems. And, of course, you must be prepared to work hard and not to be too discouraged by failure. </s>"	He would forget this failure and start the next experiment. </s>
"Question: The boy left the old man and went in another boat to fish because _ . Context: He was an old man who fished alone in a boat in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast . The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color1 as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. ""Santiago,"" the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was pulled up. ""I could go with you again. We've made some money."" The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him. ""No,"" the old man said. ""You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them.""

"Question: This story mainly tells us _ . Context: There were two McDonalds--Mac and Dick--and they were brothers. In 1948, they owned a restaurant in California, they liked working in the restaurant, but they got tired of the customers ordering so many different things to eat. ""If we gave customers a smaller menu, we could make some of the food before they came, and they wouldn't have to wait so long for their meals,"" said one of the brothers. The other brother agreed and said, ""And if we made the customers come to the counter, we wouldn't need any waiters or waitresses. We could also use plastic plates so there wouldn't be any washing-up."" These were such good ideas that McDonald brothers used them, and the customers were very pleased. They got their meals very quickly--in less than a minute--and they paid only 15 cents for hamburgers and 10 cents for fries. The first McDonald's restaurant had no seats for customers to sit on. This meant that people had to take their food away, and that no one had to clean up any tables after them. Then a man called Ray Kroc came to the brothers and asked to buy their business. They agreed to sell it to him for$27 million. After that, people paid Ray Kroc to open their own restaurants using the McDonald's name and menu. Before long, there were McDonald's restaurants all over the United States, and nowadays, they are all over the world--even in China and Russia. The most successful McDonald's business is in Hong Kong of China. The Hong Kong McDonald's sells more hamburgers every day than any other McDonald's anywhere else in the world.

"Question: The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists _ . Context: Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the ""dinner bell"" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. </s>"	may find it hard to find prey </s>
"Question: Why do the Britain people feel insular? Context: Are the British people Europeans?This may seem a strange question to Africans and Asians,who tend to think of all white men as Europeans. But the British,when they are in Britain,do not regard themselves as Europeans. The Europeans,to them,are those rather excitable foreigners from the other side of English Channel,who have never learnt how to speak English. Europe is ""the Continent"":a place full of interests for English tourists,but also the source of almost all the wars in which Britain has ever been involved. Thus,although geographically speaking Britain is a part of Europe,yet the fact that it is a separate island has made its people feel very,very insular . They feel,in many ways,different from the rest of Europe,and they sometimes annoy continental nations by failing to support them,or even to understand them,in time of need. Where did the British people come from?This is quite interesting question,since they are a mixture of many different races ,and all these races invaded Britain at various times from Europe. Nobody knows very much about prefix = st1 /Britainbefore the Romans came during the first century B. C.,but there had been at least three invasions before that. The first of these was by a dark--haired Mediterranean race called Iberians. The other two were by Celtic tribes :first the Gaels,whose descendants are the modern Scots and Irish,some of whom still speak the Gaelic language;secondly the Britons,who gave their name to the whole island of Britain. These were the people whom the Romans conquered. The Romans gave the Britons a good deal of civilization,but they never settled in Britain in very large numbers,so the British race survived until the overthrow of the Roman Empire by the""barbarians""--the numerous Germanic tribes which overran the whole of Western Europe. </s>"	Because they are separated geographically from the Continent </s>

She _ less than a month before Mother's Day in the year 2000. She had been ill for almost two years, and I didn't cry when she died, or at her funeral, but on that first Mother's Day without her. On that day, I realized that this person I loved and depended on was gone forever. She still lives in family memories, in the thoughts of her friends and co-workers, in the values she had instilled in her children, and in the lovely flower gardens that she had so carefully tended. She loved her gladioli and irises. Each fall she would dig the bulbs out of the soil and carefully wrap them in paper. The bulbs would be stored until the following spring when they would be replanted. It seemed like a lot of effort to me, but each year her flower garden was more glorious than the year before. She put the same hard work into caring for her family, instilling in her children a sense of justice and fair play, compassion, and strong moral values so that we blossomed. Share anecdotes about your mother's life at your Mother's Day party. Too often, we avoid speaking of those loved ones who have passed away, fearful that we will unearth sad feelings.

"Question: How long will Chinese people wait for to cross the road before they lose patience? Context: On May 23, Shenzhen introduced new rules in order to prevent the ""Chinese style of crossing the road"". ""Chinese people cross roads without thinking about traffic lights, so long as they are part of a group of people,"" said a post on Sina Weibo. A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people jumped red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research group at Tongji University. _ did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings for three years. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. ""People are likely to ignore the light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear,"" said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo suggested that people jaywalk mainly because they ignore rules. ""I always obey traffic rules. Time is important but safety should come first,"" someone wrote on his Weibo. Many countries give out punishments to jaywalkers. In Singapore, the maximum can be three months in prison . Some Chinese cities have started taking some actions, too. For example, the first three people in a jaywalking group will be fined 50 yuan in Shijiazhuang.

Question: We can conclude from the passage Context: Deep in the western Amazon rainforest, live butterflies that drink turtle tears. That sounds like a line straight out of a fantasy novel, but it's one hundred percent real life! It's an unusual sight--a crowd of butterflies flying around the eyes of yellow-spotted river turtles, trying to get a little tear.s. The poor turtles try to avoid them, hut the butterflies insist drinking their tears until they've had their fill. The butterflies are likely attracted to the turtles' tears because the liquid drops contain salt, specifically sodium, an important mineral that is rare in the western Amazon rainforest, said Phil Torres, a scientist who does much of his research at the Tambopata Research Center in Peru and is associated with Rice Univtrsity. Turtles get plenty of sodium through their largely carnivorous diet. Meat contains significant levels of the salt, Torres told LiveScience. But herbivores butterflies sometimes .struggle to get this extra mineral source, he added. Torres explained the western Amazon rainforest is lower in sodium than many places on earth, because it t is over l,000 miles away from the Atlantic Ocean---a main source of salt. The region is also cut off from the mineral dirt blown towards the west from the Andes Mountains. Most of these windblown minerals are removed from the air by the rain before they have a chance to reach the western Amazon. In fact, the butterflies have other sources to get sodium besides turtles' tears, which include animal urine , muddy river banks, sweaty clothes and so on. People can't help wondering if the process is painful for turtles. Torres said it's not completely clear, but the teary effort probably has little effect on the turtles, other than perhaps making them more vulnerable to their enemies like big cats, since the butterflies can block out their vision. </s>	the Andes Mountains lies east of the western Amazon rainforest </s>

I was very excited because I knew I would meet a lot of interesting people and see some amazing things there. On the night before I left, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep at all. When I sat on the plane the next day, I felt very tired. I wanted to have a good sleep during the 9-hour flight. Unluckily, there was a baby sitting next to me. It cried and screamed during the whole trip. How could I fall asleep with all of that noise? When I arrived in Paris at last, it was already 8 o'clock in the evening. I felt even more tired.

"Question: What might checking spouse's social media accounts result in? Context: Facebook and Twitter have become a significant threat to marriage - with social media now a factor in an increasing number of divorce cases, say lawyers. One in seven married individuals have considered divorce because of their spouse's postings of Facebook or other online sites, according to research. A similar percentage admit that they search online for evidence of their spouse's _ , while nearly one in five say they have daily quarrels because of the way their husband or wife uses social media. The research was assigned by law firm Gordon in response to an increase in the number of its clients who said that Facebook, Skype, Snapchat, Twitter or other social media sites had played a part in their divorce. Andrew Newbury, of law firm Gordon, said: 'Social media is the new marriage. Five years ago Facebook was rarely mentioned in the context of a marriage ending, but now it has become common."" Social media, specific pictures and posts on Facebook, are now being routinely raised in divorces.' The survey by Censuswide among 2011 husbands and wives, found the most common reasons for checking their spouse's social media accounts were to discover who they were talking to, who they were meeting and where they were going. A quarter of the married people said the resulting suspicions led to quarrels at least once a week, and 17 percent said such quarrels were daily events. Arguments were caused by contact with former partners, by the sending of secret messages, and by the posting of 'inappropriate' pictures. Some 14 percent said they looked at their spouse's social media with the specific intention of detecting evidence of adultery . </s>"	The couple lost trust between each other. </s>

It's the first time such music has ever been performed in the Grand Theater.But all this is the efforts of Zhu Zheqin, a Cantoneseborn singer, who has made it her mission to help preserve China's traditional ethnic music. In 2009, after being appointed a United Nations Development Program ambassador, Zhu traveled through some of China's remotest regions in an attempt to document the traditional music of various minority groups.In the course of the fourmonth trip, she recorded more than a thousand songs.But she noticed that many of the best musicians were old, and some of the music was at risk of dying out. ""I was shocked by the beauty of what I heard--it was so good,"" she says.""But it needed support.I hope to let people see the beauty of these things in the contemporary times."" So Zhu decided to introduce some of the musicians to a wider audience.By doing this, she hopes to rekindle the interest of the younger generation.""Young people don't like this music much; they prefer pop music and love songs.They think these songs are something their grandma sings.This kind of repackaging gives young people a new door into their heritage.""

"Question: According to the new study, the more you text, _ . Context: You've probably grown accustomed to texting in the glow of a mobile phone screen. Well, there's some good and bad news coming for those of you who spend hours speedily tapping messages to one another. The good news is that the hours you spend face-to-phone are paying off. You may have become fluent in a second language. The bad news, however, is that this language is texting. Worse still, there isn't yet a texting section in your school exams, so you'll need to work harder to recover the grammar skills you might be killing with every LOL and BRB (Be right back). A new study confirms what many parents suspect. The more kids send and receive texts, the poorer their grammar skills become. With ""the culture of mobile communication--quick back and forth , there are compromises on traditional, cultural writing"", said S. Shyam Sundar, professor of Pennsylvania State University, which conducted the study. ""Techspeak"", as Sundar and his research partner Drew P. Cingel call it, has become so prevalent among young users that it's changing their foundation of basic grammar. ""Routine use of textual adaptations by current and future generations of 13-to-17-year-olds may serve to create the impression that this is normal and accepted use of the language, ""they said in their published findings. It seems teenagers are unable to ""code switch-shift"" between standard grammar and the abbreviations used in text messages, Sundar said. These abbreviations have become the real words for them now. However, linguists aren't particularly disturbed by the trend, Sundar added. ""The linguists will tell you the language is very dynamic. "" Still, students have exams to worry about. Here's a sample of the questions, so you can test yourself to see how texting has affected your grammar: *During the flood, we (dranked, drank, drunk, drunked) bottled water. *Fortunately, Jim's name was (accepted, excepted) from the list of those who would have to clean bathrooms because he was supposed to go downtown to (accept, except) a reward for the German Club. *The dress is so large that it is (lose, loose) on me when I wear it! </s>"	the more it could affect your ability to write using traditional language </s>
"Question: USA Today is mentioned as an example to tell us _ . Context: By the middle of the 19th century, newspapers were becoming the primary means of spreading and receiving information. The period between 1890 and 1920 is known as the ""golden age"" of print media. Broadcast radio came onto the media scene in the 1920's. Newspapers were forced to re-evaluate their role as society's primary information provider. Like the new media technologies of today, the development of a low-cost, convenient media source produced results that radio would greatly affect the newspaper industry. No sooner had newspapers adapted to radio than they were forced to re-evaluate themselves because of a new and more powerful medium: television. Between 1940 and 1990, newspaper sales in America dropped from one newspaper for every two adults to one for every three adults. Some newspapers, like USA Today, responded to the technological advancements by using color1 and the ""short, quick and to the point"" stories that are usually featured on television. The technological revolution of today is creating new challenges and opportunities for traditional media. Never before has so much information been so accessible to so many. By the end of the 1990s, about 700 traditional media had websites; today there are thousands.

"Question: The research took the following factors into consideration EXCEPT _ Context: If you've ever seen the way dog people interacted with their pets, it comes as no surprise that there's some germ-exchanging going on there. A new study indicates that dog ownership specifically may be one of the biggest single contributors to what kinds of microbes live on your skin. A team of researchers led by Se Jin Song at the University of Colorado, Boulder, took swabs of the tongues, palms, forehead and feces of members of 60 family households. Some of the families had children or household pets and some did not; dogs were the only pets swabbed. Researchers then analyzed the DNA of the bacteria they found to determine how diverse the bacteria populations were. Not surprisingly, family members who lived together had more bacteria in common than members of separate households. Bacteria on the skin were especially similar within households, probably because we pass microbes through the air, through direct contact, and via the surfaces we touch. The most surprising finding, however, was the large bacteria contribution Fidonad made. The skin bacteria of dog owners from different households was almost as similar as if they'd cohabited without a dog. Put another way, you and a friend across town who both own dogs share a skin ecosystem as alike as a married couple does. The reason for this appears to be that dogs harbor some kinds of bacteria that are rare on human skin. One in particular, a family of bacteria called Methylophilaceae, was abundant in the mouths of dogs sampled as well as the skin of their owners--indicating ""a common occurrence of oral-skin transfer between dogs and their owners,"" according to the results published in the journal eLife. </s>"	dogs being the only pets in the households. </s>

Question: The international high schools in New York _ Context: Some American high schools are for students with special interests, like science or the arts. New York City even has a program for those interested in the food service industry, called Food and Finance High School. New York also has what are called international high schools, or internationals, for immigrant students. They must be new learners of English who have been in the United States less than four years. The first school opened in nineteen eighty-five. The city will begin the new term next month with ten. New York works with a nonprofit organization, the Internationals Network for Public Schools. Support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has helped the network expand. The network says the graduation rate was seventy percent last year in the four New York schools open long enough to have graduating classes. That, compared with twenty-three percent for English language learners in all of the city schools. Over all, New York officials recently reported that the city's four-year graduation rate, reached fifty-two percent last year. At the same time, they reported that the city's dropout rate fell below fifteen percent. The Internationals Network says its schools have an average dropout rate of just five percent. Claire Sylvan is the executive director of the group. She says students drop out mainly because their families need them to work or because parents arrange marriages for girls. The Internationals Network mainly helps find teachers and trains them in the teaching method of the internationals. Claire Sylvan says the teaching approach is to have students use their different strengths to help each other. They work in small groups, but she says they are not grouped by ability. She says the students discuss issues, then produce a product like a paper, a play, a poster or a report. They learn English as they work. </s>	will expand from having one school to having ten </s>

"Question: The effect of performance-related bonuses has not been well studied because people _ . Context: Bonus culture has become the subject of many studies nowadays. Many people have been angered by the way some bankers and high officials seem to have been rewarded for failure. Others find the idea of offering many-million-dollar bonuses morally disgusting. But few have asked whether performance-related bonuses really do improve performance. The answer seems so obvious that even to ask the question can appear ridiculous. Indeed, in spite of all the complaints about them, financial encouragements continue to be introduced in more and more areas, from healthcare and public services to teaching and universities. So it may come as a shock to many to learn that paying for results can actually make people perform badly in many circumstances, and that the more you pay, the worse they perform. No one is arguing that bonuses can help companies and institutions attract and keep the best staff. Nor does anyone argue against the idea that you can encourage people to do specific tasks by linking payments to those tasks. Rather, the point is about how to get the best out of people. Do employees really perform better if you promise to pay them more for getting results? There are some obvious reasons why such payments can fail. It has been argued, for instance, that cash bonuses contributed to the financial crash, because traders had little enthusiasm to make sure that their companies enjoyed long-term survival. Most bonus projects are poorly designed, says Professor Malcolm Higgs. He thinks the reason is that organizations try to keep bonus arrangements simple. Nevertheless, he thinks bonus projects can work as long as they link the interests of individual employees with the long-term goals of a business. Bonuses can also encourage cheating. ""Once you start making people's rewards dependent on outcomes rather than behaviors, the evidence is people will do whatever they can to get those outcomes,"" says Professor Edward Deci. ""In many cases the high officials simply lied and cheated to make the stock price go up so they got huge bonuses."" But the work of Deci and others suggests the problem with bonuses runs far deeper than poor design or cheating. In 1971, he asked students to solve puzzles, with some receiving cash prizes for doing well and others getting nothing. Deci found those offered cash were less likely to keep working on puzzles after they had done enough to get paid. These studies suggest that offering rewards can stop people doing things for the pure joy of it. This was the basis for a series of books by Kohn in which he argues that rewarding children, students and workers with grades, scholarships and other ""bribes"" leads to low-quality work in the long run. Those who believe in the power of bonuses fail to distinguish between inner drive and outside pressure -- wanting to do something because you like it for itself in contrast to doing something because you want the reward, Kohn says. ""It's not just that these two are different, it's often that the more you reward people for doing something, the more their inner drive tends to decline."" A ""do this and get that"" approach might improve performance in the short term, but over longer periods it will always fail, Kohn says. People who receive bonus will naturally play safe, become less creative, cooperate less and feel less valued, he adds. What's more, the studies also suggest that offering rewards can also stop people taking responsibility. </s>"	take the function of bonuses for granted </s>
"Question: Which might be the most suitable title for the passage ? Context: There's no shortage of web sites offering deals-everything from daily deals to members-only private sales.But when it comes to real jaw-dropping deals, there's one company that seems to have figured out a out a way to really deliver. The company is called QuiBids and they auction the hottest, in-demand electronics like Apple ipads and ipods, as well as other items like gift cards from the top retailers .Unlike other sites, the prices people pay are nowhere near retail.How low are the prices? $33.84 for a new Apple ipad 32 GB(retail $600) $22.10 for a new Nikon D90 Digital SLR Camera(retail $1070) Our first reaction on seeing these prices was disbelief.After all, how cold QuiBids possibly afford to sell these items for so little-surely they must be losing a lot of money. That's where its unique business model comes into play.You see, for every bid a buyer places for an item on QuiBids, the company collects a small fee from the bidder.The fee to bid is only about 60 cents, but based on the volume of sales and bids, the company is able to collect enough to make up for the ridiculous prices the items sell for. But best of all, participating in the QuiBids auction is incredibly fun.Because each each bid costs a little to place, shoppers can strategize when to place their bids.Each auction has a strict time limit.When you place your bid, the system adds a little time to the auction to see if any other bids cone in.If you have the winning bid when the cock runs out-you win the item for that price. But the best part of Quibids may be the ""Buy-It-Now""feature.This allows bidders who did not win an auction to still buy the product they want and apply the cost of the bids they placed as a discount on the regular product price. So you still get the item and the bids you placed previously in the auction don't cost you anything! </s>"	Buy Products for Next to Nothing </s>
"Question: How many people were in the museum during the robbery?

The bandits also took two oil paintings by well-know Brazilian artists Emiliano Di Cavalcanti and Lasar Segall, said Carla Regina, a spokeswoman for the Pinacoteca do Estado museum. The Picasso prints stolen were ""The Painter and the Model"" from 1963 and ""Minotaur, Drinker and Women"" from 1933, according to a statement from the Sao Paulo Secretary of State for Culture, which oversees the museum. The prints and paintings have a combined value of $612,000, the statement and a museum official said. About noon, three armed men paid the $2.45 entrance fee and immediately went to the second-floor gallery where the works were being exhibited, bypassing more valuable pieces, authorities said. ""This indicates to us that they probably received an order"" to take those specific works, Youssef Abou Chain, head of Sao Paulo's organized crime unit, told reporters at a news conference. The assailants overpowered three unarmed museum guards and grabbed the works, officials said. The robbery took about 10 minutes and the museum was nearly empty at the time. The assailants took the pieces -- frames and all -- out of the museum in two bags. The institution has no metal detectors. In December, Picasso's ""Portrait of Suzanne Bloch"" and ""O Lavrador de Cafe"" by Candido Portinari, an influential Brazilian artist, were stolen from the Sao Paulo Museum of Art by three men who used a crowbar and car jack to force open one of the museum's steel doors. The framed paintings were found Jan. 8, covered in plastic and leaning against a wall in a house on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.

He said in a proud way, ""Even a bear would be as quiet as the friendliest cat when hearing my music."" But he had never played, and no one believed him. A chance to show his words arrived just when a circus came to the town. The musician came to the ringmaster and told what he could do. ""Wow, that's interesting."" The ringmaster said. ""We just have three new lions and they haven't worked with the lion tamer yet. Let's see what you can do with them."" The violinist agreed and the whole town crowded the hall to see what would happen. The violinist was standing quietly in the center of the ring with a smile.

Question: The tea in silk bags was welcome because _ . Context: Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about? The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go. </s>	the tea tasted good and the cup was easy to wash </s>
Question: The only victims of rising house prices are _ . Context: In China ,with the development of society, more and more people are annoyed at the continually rising house prices. They want to know who is to blame for it. Local governments,developers and speculators share a vested interest in it. People who are really in need of homes are most likely to suffer heavy losses. Many local governments depend on selling land to keep its normal operation. The higher land prices,the more money. Therefore,developers back the local governments by buying land at high prices. In return,the governments make favorable policies to help the developers. For example,drive all the possible home buyers to this nasty market. They even encourage large numbers of speculators to catch more people. Rising house prices have already become the fence which divides the Chinese society. It has caused widespread dissatisfaction. The government will lose the support of the common people if leaving house prices out of control. Besides,rising house prices will stop us building the new countryside as the present policy actually forbid people to flow freely from cities to the countryside. Collecting taxes on houses can fundamentally solve this problem. On one hand,it will discourage the speculators. On the other hand,it will offer a stable tax resource apart from reducing the sales cost of the developers. secondly,stop the developers selling the houses before completion. If so,the developers will certainly try their best to sell all their houses once completed. And this will also lower speculators' expectation of price rising,which will decrease speculations. </s>	real home buyers </s>
"Question: Through the passage,the author shows us _ . Context: The barks of dogs surrounded me as I got off the bus. They ran around their cages jumping up and down. My heart became soft at the sight of these poor creatures. I entered the building and discovered more unwanted animals. A white rabbit jumped around in its cage. I walked around the shelter,screaming ""oh"" and ""ah"" at every animal,as they looked out of their cages,waiting for love and help. A pit bull particularly interested me. She was as gentle as a baby. I slightly touched her head with affection as she sat on the floor. The pit bull licked my hand with appreciation as she cried. A litter of puppies were in the cage opposite the pit bull. They snuggled together for warmth as one of the puppies let out a weak bark,as if calling to its mother. Recognizing my love and willingness to help these puppies,the director suggested I give them a bath. I lifted one of the puppies,Yukie,from his brothers and sisters. His black fur was as soft as cotton candy. I held him tightly. The sweet smell of liquid soap surrounded the wash area. The puppy seemed like a tiny fish,swimming delightedly in a pool. Water dropped down his black,soft ears as he tried to shake off the heavy water. I wrapped Yukie in a towel as he licked my hand. After all the cleaning and drying,he looked as if he'd come from an expensive pet shop. I kissed his little face as I unwillingly placed him back. Next,I walked some dogs around the shelter. They jumped out of their cages,unable to hold back their urge for exercise. I ran around with them,while touching them gently and talking to them. They moved back when the time came to put them back. The time came to leave. I silently promised these creatures to come and again provide them with love.

Numerous vacations help the couple to maintain their health and emotional well-being-and it's no surprise to health care professionals. ""Rest,relaxation, and stress reduction are very important for people's weLl-being and health. This can be accomplished through daily activities,such as exercise and meditation,but vacation is an important part of this as well,"" said primary care physician Natasha Withers from One Medical Group in New York. Withers lists a decreased risk of heart disease and improved reaction time as some of the benefits from taking some time off. ""We also know that the mind is very powerful and can help with healing,so a rested,relaxed mind is able to help the body heal better,"" said Withers. Psychologists confirm the value of vacations for the mind. "" The impact that taking a vacation has on one's mental health is great,"" said Francine Lederer,a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who specializes in stress and relationship management. "" Most people have better life perspective and are more motivated to achieve their goals after a vacation,even if it is a 24- hour time-out. "" The trips could be good for their health,good for their family and good for their .businesses. The online travel agency Expedia conducted a survey about vacation time in 2010,and according to their data the average American eamed 18 vacation days-but only used 14 0f them. France topped the list,with the average worker earning 37 vacation days and using all but two of them. Americans' responses may not be surprising in a culture where long hours on the job often are valued,but that's not always good for the individual,the family or the employer. Psychologists have also found that people who don't take enough time to relax may find it harder to relax in the future. ""Without time and opportunity to do this,the nerve connections that produce feelings of calm and peacefulness become weaker,making it actually more difficult to shift into less-stressed states,"" Mulhern said. </s>"	think much of spending long hours on the job </s>
"Question: Who discovered the Heidelbergnotes? Context: German academics believe they have solved the centuries-old mystery of the ""Mona Lisa"" in Leonardo ad Vinci's famous portrait . Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, has long been seen as the most likely model for the sixteenth-century painting. Art historians have wondered whether the smiling woman may actually have been da Vinci's lover or mother, or the artist himself. Now experts at the prefix = st1 /HeidelbergUniversitylibrary say old notes made in a book by its owner in October, 1503, confirm that Lisa del Giocondo was indeed the model for the famous portrait in the world. ""All doubts about the identity of the Mona Lisa have been removed by a discovery by Dr. Armin Schlechter,"" the library said in a statement on Monday. ""Until then, only 'scant evidence' from sixteenth-century documents had been available. These had left lots of room for doubt, and many different identities were put forward."" The comments compare Leonardo to the ancient Greek artist Apelles, and say he was working on three paintings at that time, one of which was a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. Art experts say the Heidelbergdiscovery is a break-through, and the earliest mention linking the merchant's wife to the portrait. Before this discovery the earliest link dated from around 1550, and was made by Italian official Giorgio Vasari, the library said, adding that there had been doubts about Vasari's reliability. The Heidelbergnotes were actually discovered over two year's ago in the library by Schlechter, a spokeswoman said. Although the findings were published in the library's catalogue, they were not widely publicized, and received little attention until a German broadcaster decided to do some recording there, she said. </s>"	Dr. Armin Schlechter. </s>

Philip Walker,spokesman for the General Social Survey,said because it was ly new it was hard to know whether loneliness among young people was a new trend.But overseas research has found that levels of loneliness in youth today are growing. Mr.Walker said the finding needed more exploration,including looking at the role of technology and social media.""It could be that people's expectations of connection have gone up,so we expect increased levels of connection,""he said.""While technology like cell phones could help young people stay connected,on the other hand for those who do get bullied ,especially bullied online,it's quite isolating.A lot of the time potentially it is a big contributor to loneliness.""

"Question: Which might be the best title for the passage? Context: The world's most famous awards, the Nobel Prizes, are given for achievements that benefit humankind. Ironically they are named for a 19thcentury scientist who invented powerful explosives that came to be used as weapons of war. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish-born chemist who died in 1896, was known by some as ""The Mad Scientist,"" and by others as ""The Merchant of Death."" He was really pacifist, who at one time believed that his explosives could end warfare. Later, he realized that he was wrong. ""High explosives will not stop men from war,"" he wrote. ""Nobody will benefit from my inventions except manufacturers of war materials, some generals, and diplomats."" Nobel was born in Sweden in 1833. His father was an architect and inventor who moved to Russia. With only one year formal schooling, Nobel became a chemist and inventor by the age of 16. He was also excellent in languages, speaking English, Russian, German, and French in addition to Swedish. He wrote poetry. His study of explosives began with manufacturing liquid nitroglycerin for use in mining and construction. But in 1864, the factory blew up, killing his youngest brother and four others. He then discovered that liquid nitroglycerin could be dried and handled safely to be a mixture, which can explode. He called the mixture dynamite, after the Greek word dynamis, meaning ""power."" He then perfected a more powerful form of dynamite that made him a multimillionaire. When he died, his fortune was about $9 million. Nobel never married, and he left his fortune to what has since become known as the Nobel Prizes. The money is invested and the interest is given out every year as prizes for the most important work in six fields: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. Nobel Prize winners receive money, a gold medal, and a diploma. Prizes were first awarded in 1901, and the list of Nobel laureates contains many well-known names: Albert Einstein in Physics, Marie Curie in Chemistry, Toni Morrison and William Faulkner in Literature, Martin Luther King, Jr., for Peace. </s>"	The Nobel Prizes </s>

""Imagine that I am connected to you and you are connected to others and others are connected to still others. It is this fabric of humanity, like an American patch quilt."" Each person sits on a different colored patch. ""Imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches. Your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you,"" Christakis said. ""It is not just happy people connecting with happy people, which they do. Above and beyond, there is this contagious process going on."" And happiness is more contagious than unhappiness, they discovered. ""If a social contact is happy, it increases the likelihood that you are happy by 15 percent, "" Fowler said. ""A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent,"" he added. A happy third degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent. ""But every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you'll be unhappy by 7 percent,"" Fowler said. The finding is interesting and it is useful, too, Fowler said. ""Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality , pain reduction, and improved cardiac function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to develop a healthier society,"" he said. The study also fits in with other data suggested in 1984 that having $ 5,000 extra increased a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent.

"Question: The reason why there are no personal possessions in Utopia is that _ . Context: Utopia is a perfect place. It is a place without war, hunger, poverty, or crime. It is a place where the people work together and share. There is no money in Utopia because the people do not need money. They do not have personal possessions because everything belongs to everyone. All of the people are equal in Utopia, and the laws are all fair. Utopia is not a new place. Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher, described a perfect society in his famous dialogue The Republic. In Plato's Republic, philosophers were the kings, and every person had a place in the society. In 1516, Sir Thomas More wrote about an island in the Pacific Ocean where everything was perfect. He named the island "" Utopia"". In 1602, Tommaso Campanella wrote The City in the Sun about a perfect community on the island of Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) ; and in 1872, Samuel Butler wrote a novel about a perfect country which he named "" Erewhon"". "" Utopia"" is a Greek word that means "" not a place"", and ""Erewhon"" is the English word "" nowhere"" spelled backwards. Utopia is a perfect place, but it is not a real place. Most 'real' Utopias last only a short time. This is because everyone wants to live in it, but no one knows how to make it work. As a result, when we say something is ' Utopia' today, we mean that it is a good idea, but it is not realistic. </s>"	everything belongs to everyone </s>

On the other hand, if you add ""family"" to these three choices given above, there is a chance that 99% of the people are going to put their family first, especially if they happen to be ladies! The main reason is because nature has created a woman to be the cherisher and the nurturer of the family, while the man is the hunter and protector of his little family. That is the natural rule which has come down through thousands of years. Even if a person happens to be a comparatively worldly-wise person and has no idea of taking on the responsibility of a family, he has a picture of a tight little _ in his subconscious .

So, you might be an extremely successful person in your own right upon Wall Street, but if your little child fails to come running out to welcome his daddy at the end of the day to be swung up in his father's arms and held there lovingly and protectively, you come in the ""nothing"" category in the business of life. Many people are under the impression that taking on the responsibility of the family is quite tiresome, but they do not know what it takes to be a parent. It is very easy to be a biological father or a biological mother, but the real mother and the real father is that person who stays awake all night when the baby is teething, teaches him right from wrong, is there to hold him when he takes his first steps, and in every way shows that he is there to cherish and protect the little one from harm. There was a man who did not believe in family, because of an unhappy childhood. But he found a faithful woman to love him unconditionally. The moment he picked up his little baby, he said, ""Well son, welcome to the world! I am here to teach you what your mama has taught me, and we shall both protect you, when you need our help.

Question: Eric, his wife and their 16-year-old child want to join the club. They should pay _ for a year. Context: Information for New Members Welcome to Banktown Bushwalking Club! Here are some things you need to know: Most walks are in faraway places. You need to take enough food and water for a full day of activity on each walk. This is the most important thing to remember. Wear good lace-up shoes, because you need to do some climbing sometimes. Each walk has a grade. If you haven't been bushwalking before, we suggest that you start with an easy walk- Grade 1 or 2. If you have been bushwalking before, then a Grade 3 walk may be suitable. All beginners need to call or e-mail the leader of an activity 48 hours before the start of the activity. They need to make sure that you are fit and able to finish the activity as planned. Membership fees for a year: $35 for an adult over 18 years old. If a family joins the club, fees will be lower. $55 for the parents and $10 for each child between the ages of 5 and 18. </s>	$65 </s>
Question: It is possible to escape through the windows _ . Context: (B) What are you going to do if you are in a burning house? Escaping a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save yourself. It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways and fire escapes, but not lifts . From the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury . The second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On a second or third floor, the best windows for escaping are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely, dropping onto stones might end in injury. </s>	if there is some grass on the ground </s>
"Question: Who do you think the writer of the passage is? Context: There are few families in the United States that do not have either a radio or television set. Both of them have become a necessary part of our daily life, keeping us filled with the news of the day, teaching us in many fields of interest, and making us happy with singing, dancing and acting. Marconl, the Italian inventor, who gave us the radio, probably didn't know how much his great invention would have done for the world in the years to come. Radio had, perhaps done as much as any other communication tool. Things of the world can be reported to people everywhere a few seconds after they happen. Travelers in or out of-the-way places, ships at sea even astronauts round the earth are able to keep in touch with each other by radio. Television is another important invention. It lets us see as well as hear the actor. Since its appearance, TV has done a great deal in the daily life of people everywhere. Many programs are now televised in color. Perhaps the most modern invention is ""Telstar"", a ""star"" moving round the earth. It makes it possible for the people all over the world to be closer than ever before. Now a family in Chicago can watch on TV a motor-car race in Italy, a table tennis competition in Beijing or a volleyball match in Japan as these events are actually happening! </s>"	An American. </s>
"Question: We can conclude that the new technology will _ . Context: Driving speeds have largely stabilized, and nowadays, safety concerns are important and reducing road accidents to minimum is a must. So, automakers are focused on safety systems more than ever before. Given the emphasis on improving safety, it's possible that well-known phrases such as ""live fast and die young"" may lose their meaning as innovative new devices are built into cars and trucks and other things that go. Many of the new safety systems that are being added to high-end vehicles are computer-assisted technologies that transfer some of the vehicle's operations to the vehicle itself, rather than relying only on the driver's decision-making skills. For example, predictive brake assist is an in-vehicle feature that prepares the vehicle for braking when its built-in sensors detect a potential object ahead. The predictive brake assist basically places the vehicle's braking system on alert, which helps the system to slow down the car in as little time and as short a distance as possible. Other in-vehicle sensors will detect moving and still objects and will even distinguish the objects based on simple patterns, such as other vehicles vs. a person. What's more, built-in ""active systems"", i.e., predictive precollision systems, will provide drivers with advance detection of potential contact between vehicles. These systems compute the movement of the objects and detect possible dangerous intersections . What technological developments have enabled innovations like predictive precollision systems? Essentially, these so-called active systems are the result of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. These communication links allow highways to provide a vehicle's owners with services such as renting a movie during the trip, as well as reduce reaction delays when medical care is needed due to a crash. Despite these new technologies, drivers cannot take safety for granted. Until all vehicles are fully automated, it is the drivers themselves who are responsible for operating their vehicles and obeying traffic laws designed to keep roadways secure. So, keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the steering wheel . </s>"	see a wide use in the future </s>

"Question: The McDonald brothers offered customers fewer kinds of foods so that _ . Context: There were two McDonalds--Mac and Dick--and they were brothers. In 1948, they owned a restaurant in California, they liked working in the restaurant, but they got tired of the customers ordering so many different things to eat. ""If we gave customers a smaller menu, we could make some of the food before they came, and they wouldn't have to wait so long for their meals,"" said one of the brothers. The other brother agreed and said, ""And if we made the customers come to the counter, we wouldn't need any waiters or waitresses. We could also use plastic plates so there wouldn't be any washing-up."" These were such good ideas that McDonald brothers used them, and the customers were very pleased. They got their meals very quickly--in less than a minute--and they paid only 15 cents for hamburgers and 10 cents for fries. The first McDonald's restaurant had no seats for customers to sit on. This meant that people had to take their food away, and that no one had to clean up any tables after them. Then a man called Ray Kroc came to the brothers and asked to buy their business. They agreed to sell it to him for$27 million. After that, people paid Ray Kroc to open their own restaurants using the McDonald's name and menu. Before long, there were McDonald's restaurants all over the United States, and nowadays, they are all over the world--even in China and Russia. The most successful McDonald's business is in Hong Kong of China. The Hong Kong McDonald's sells more hamburgers every day than any other McDonald's anywhere else in the world. McDonald's restaurants are so successful because children love going to them. They like the food, and they like the toys and games they can get at McDonald's. </s>"	customers could get their meals quickly </s>
"Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements is true? Context: If you have ever gone through a toll booth , you know that your relationship to the person in the booth is not the most intimate you'll ever have. It is one of life's frequent affairs: You hand over some money; you might get change; you drive off. Late one morning in 1984, headed for lunch in San Francisco, I drove toward a booth. I heard loud music. It sounded like a party. I looked around. No other cars with their windows open. No sound trucks. I looked at the toll booth. Inside it, the man was dancing. ""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""I'm having a party,"" he said. ""What about the rest of the people?"" I looked at the other toll booths. He said, ""What do those look like to you?"" He pointed down the row of toll booths. ""They look like......toll booths. What do they look like to you?"" He said, ""Vertical coffins. At 8:30 every morning, live people get in. Then they die for eight hours. At 4:30, like _ from the dead, they reemerge and go home. For eight hours, brain is on hold, dead on the job. Going through the motions."" I was amazed. This guy had developed a philosophy, a mythology about his job. Sixteen people dead on the job, and the seventeenth, in precisely the same situation, figures out a way to live. I could not help asking the next question: ""Why is it different for you? You're having a good time."" He looked at me. ""I knew you were going to ask that.

Question: According to the text, in the past poems were _ . Context: Traditionally poems would be recited and passed from poet to poet through the ages. It is only recently that poetry is something that one reads alone, rather than reciting to an audience. At some point in the education of any student majoring in poetry, one will attempt to memorize a poem, and possibly recite it to someone else. Chances are that you have already memorized thousands of lines of verse in the form of lyrics. How did you memorize the lyrics of songs? You simply listened to songs you liked over and over again until you almost couldn't help but have them memorized. Memorizing poetry isn't much different. You start with a poem you like, recite it to yourself over and over again, and you get to know it. One of the best aspects of learning a poem by heart is that you get to take a poem inside of yourself. It becomes a part of you. When you memorize a poem, it is no longer just a poem, but yours. It's in your head, and you can call it up from memory as you would in any other experience. Also, memorizing a poem is a great way to truly get to understand languages, and consider every phrase, line, and word. You can practice varying the sounds, adding pauses and emphasis in different spots to try to find the most accurate tone for the poem. In a way, you never really know a poem until you've memorized it. Once you know it, you'll be able to recite it, like a jazz musician improvising inside a song's boundaries - adding his own words or re-wording a section to make it his own. </s>	mainly circulated among poets by oral communication </s>

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read.

This week, the chairman of America's nuclear agency said there is little chance that harmful radiation from Japan could reach the United States. Gregory also said America has a strong program in place to deal with earthquake threats. No new nuclear power centers have been built in the United States since nineteen seventy-nine. That was when America's worst nuclear accident happened at the Three Mile Island center in Pennsylvania. The accident began to turn public opinion against nuclear energy. At present, about twenty percent of electricity in the United States comes from nuclear energy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would close seven nuclear power centers while energy policy is reconsidered. The European Union is planning to test all centers in its twenty-seven member nations. Developing nations are less willing to slow nuclear expansion. China said it will continue with plans to build about twenty-five new nuclear reactors . And India, under a cooperation agreement with the United States, plans to spend billions on new centers in the coming years. Nuclear reactors supply fourteen percent of global electricity.

Question: From the passage,we can learn that _ . Context: When you are far away from home for the first time and have a lot to adjust to,you can't do it alone. However independent you are,it is good to have a roommate during your first year. Living with someone helps ease your loneliness. Sure it may seem appealing to be able to play your music and turn up your TV as loud as you want, but coming home to an empty room every day can be depressing. If you have a bad day, you may want to talk to someone. Friends are great sources of venting , but friends can't always be there. Even worse, they may be selfcentered and show no interest in your problem. It's not that roommates aren't like this, but even just small talk can help you feel better. Having a roommate teaches you how to get along with people and settle conflict. You two should set up rules immediately and discuss what to do when there is conflict. If you two don't like each other,you still study,relax,and sleep in the same room. You must find a way to get along. Finally,having a roommate exposes you to different ways of living. Your roommate may come from a different city,and have different living habits. He or she also has different interests and personalities. You don't have to end up liking the same things your roommate does,but try to learn something different. You will be surrounded by many different people in college and have the chance to try things you never have before. Why not start learning from your roommate? Having a roommate gives you the skills and personal background you will need to utilize when you are out on your own.

"Question: From the passage, we know that Kathy is_. Context: Kathy started at my nursery school at the age of three. She settled into the group easily, and would be first on the slide and highest up the climbing frame. She could put on her coat without help and not only fasten her own buttons but other children's too. She was a lovely child but unfortunately a scratcher. If anyone upset her or stood in her way, her right hand would flash out fast and scratch down the face of her playmates. Children twice her age would fly in fear from her. This must have been very rewarding for Kathy but obviously it had to be stopped. All the usual ways failed and then I remembered and account by G.

So I decided to try this out on Kathy. With a pocketful of Smarties I followed Kathy around. She was so quick that it was impossible to prevent her scratching, but I was determined to stay within arm's length all afternoon. All was peaceful but then I saw Kathy's hand moved and heard the scream. Gently I gathered up the little hurt one in my arms and said ""Nice, nice sweetie"" and I put a Smartie into her mouth. Kathy opened her mouth, expecting a Smartie and then looked puzzled when she got nothing. Soon came another scream, this time from John. While holding him in my arms, I said, ""Look, Kathy, a nice Smartie for John"" and put it into John's mouth. A smile of understanding flashed across Kathy's face, Minutes later, she came to me and said loudly, ""Give me a Smartie! I have hurt my finger!"" ""No,"" I replied, ""you'll get it if someone hurts you."" On purpose, she turned and scratched a nearby boy. Tom, and waited quietly while I mothered and rewarded him, then she walked away.

Question: Watch collectors want to get the improved watch, especially for its _ . Context: Have you ever dreamed of having a fashionable watch of great value? A small watchmaker in Switzerland in 1922 designed the first automatic watch to show the day, month , and date. Only seven of these splendid watches were ever made and these watches were almost lost to history. Today, it is so hard to get and original watch that some watch historians are even willing to offer $200,000 for one. These watches attracted a lot of people for their splendid color1, fashionable style and new uses in the 1920s. The owners of the watches were admired and set apart from the crowd. Because the number of the original watches is very limited, owning such a watch will make you feel very special. Today, you are offered the same kind of watch with improvement. It has a 24-jewel mechanical movement, the kind desired by watch collectors. The watchmaker has made the movement of the watch much more modern with an automatic rotor so that the watch never needs to be wound by hand. The watch comes in a very beautiful case with a crocodile design on it. To get a watch in such a perfect design means to get a chance to know a piece of watch-making history and to wear such a watch will show your personal taste and social position.

Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the earth. On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared.

You have genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity . Heredity means all the characteristics you inherit from your parents. You get your genes from your parents. You inherit half of your genes from your mother. You inherit half of your genes from your father. Genes are a kind of code. A tree's genes tell what shape its leaves will be. A cat's genes tell what color1 its fur will be. Your genes tell what color1 your eyes will be. Your genes tell what color1 your hair will be. Everything about you comes from the code in your genes. Genes line up on strands called chromosomes in cells. Everything alive is made up of cells. Chromosomes are in the center, or nucleus, of cells. An Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first saw inherited patterns in pea plants. He experimented with pea plants in the 1860s. One of the things, or traits , Mendel studied was what makes some pea plants tall and some short. He said that the traits must come from units of heredity passed from the parent plants. These units were called genes. In the mid-1900s, scientists discovered that genes are made of DNA. In the 1970s, scientists learned how to change DNA with genetic engineering. Scientists also learned that problems with certain genes cause diseases. Muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and hemophilia are some genetic diseases--diseases caused by problems in genes. Today, scientists are looking for ways to cure genetic diseases by _ genes through a process called gene therapy. </s>	It is probably their son will have either blue eyes or grey ones. </s>

"Question: What do we know about PPAR-gamma 1? _ Context: Dust on furniture may be bad news for waistlines . But it's far too early to add dusting to a weight-loss plan. Dietary fats and other materials that make up indoor dust can send a signal to human fat cells, telling them to grow. That process, in turn, might slow the body's rate of burning energy. Such changes could add to any weight problems a person might have. ""We don't know what that means to long-term health and certain diseases yet,"" says Heather Stapleton, one of the study's authors. But she notes that her team's findings also raise a question of whether pollutants in dust might play some role in the growing, global problem of obesity . Stapleton and her colleagues collected dust from homes and offices. Studies found that some materials in the dust could turn on a protein called PPAR-gamma 1. It's found in many human tissues. Turning this protein on can cause fat cells to grow. Researchers think this protein may be involved in obesity. But a second study now finds evidence that certain fats are mostly to blame. Cooking oils may send out some of these fats into the air, where they eventually find their way into house dust. Or, the authors say, the fats might enter house dust as part of the hair or skin cells shed by people or pets. ""While the findings are amazing,"" says Mitchell Lazar, another study author, ""these findings need to be taken as very limited."" Indeed, he adds several cautions about how the findings should be understood. ""For one thing, people eat these fats in foods all of the time. That is likely to be a lot more than would be consumed from indoor dust,"" he said. </s>"	It leads to weight gain. </s>
Question: What is the disadvantage of underlining according to the author? Context: A good reader becomes sooner or later a good book buyer.The sooner,the better. The reading done in a book drawn from a library can not be so pleasant at the moment nor so permanently useful as the reading done in our own copy. A book which is worth reading is likely to be read more than once,and at each reading some idea or some statement makes such an impression that we wish to refer to it again. Some readers underline the page as they read,but I find that a page which I have underlined can not give me so many fresh impressions as one which has no marks on it.My habit is to make my own index of a book as I read.I put down the number of the page and a word or two to identify the thought or the fact which I get from it.On a second or third reading I am likely to double or triple the size of this index.This is my substitute for underlining.Most of the books in my library are so indexed that I can find quickly the passage which from time to time I wish to look up. To use a book in this way,organizing it for continued usefulness year after year, we must,of course,do our reading in a copy which belongs to us.The books I buy are chiefly those of less expensive editions. As I have grown older and the number of books on my shelves has increased,I appre- ciate editions which do not take much room.By careful and continuous selection I keep my librarv down to ten thousand books.This would be,of course,too large a number for any but a professional scholar or writer.But my advice to a book lover is to weed but his library at least once every two years,giving away the books which are not likely to be read again. And never never buy a book which you will not immediately read.A library bought only for looks is not literature,but indoor decoration. </s>	Underlined books cannot give the reader enough fresh impressions. </s>
"Question: It can be inferred from the passage that in hunting and gathering cultures _ . Context: Prolonging human life has increased the size of the human population. Many people alive today would have died of childhood diseases if they had been born 100 years ago. Because more people live longer, there are more people around at any given time. In fact, it is a decrease in death rates, not an increase in birthrates, that has led to the population explosion. Prolonging human life has also increased the dependency load. In all societies, people who are disabled or too young or too old to work are dependent on the rest of society to provide for them. In hunting and gathering cultures, old people who could not keep up might be left behind to die. In times of , infants might be allowed to die because they could not survive if their parents starved, where as if the parents survived they could have another child. In most contemporary societies, people feel a moral to keep people alive whether they can work or not. We have a great many people today who live past the age at which they want to work or are able to work; we also have rules which require people to retire at a certain age. Unless these people were able to save money for their retirement, somebody else must support them. In the United States many retired people live on social security checks which are so little that they must live in near poverty. Older people have more illnesses than young or middle-aged people; unless they have wealth or private or government insurance, they must often ""go on welfare"" if they have a serious illness. When older people become or too weak and ill to care for themselves, they create grave problems for their families. In the past and in some traditional cultures, they would be cared for at home until they died. Today, with most members of a household working or in school, there is often no one at home who can care for a sick or weak person. To meet , a great many nursing homes and hospitals have been built. These are often profit making organizations, although some are sponsored by religious and other nonprofit groups. While a few of these institutions are good, most of them are simply "" grounds"" for the dying in which ""care"" is given by poorly paid, overworked, and under skilled . </s>"	the survival of infants was less important than that of their parents in times of starvation </s>

When she went outside, she'd take hold of an apple, put it far back in her mouth, and _ the house to save for eating later.

When I called her back into the house, she had her usual one apple in her mouth. About five minutes later, I looked outside. The yard was completely covered with birds.

"Question: What happened to the three men's car? Context: Three men were travelling across the desert when their car broke down. There were no other traffics, so their only hope was to walk. Before they set off, they looked around in the car for useful things to take with them. One of the men took a bottle of whisky. Another took an umbrella. The third unscrewed a door from the car and carried that. After they had been walking for almost a day, they came across a camel caravan travelling towards them. ""Let's try to join the caravan,"" one of the men said. ""It's going the wrong way but we'll be safer than if we keep on alone across the desert."" The other s agreed, so they asked the leader of the caravan for permission to join it. ""You can join the caravan only if you answer three questions,"" he said. He pointed to the first man's bottle. ""What is that and why are you carrying it?"" he asked. ""It's a bottle of whisky. I decided to carry it with me so that if I feel miserable and want to give up, I can get drunk, cheer myself up and then keep on walking."" ""Very sensible,"" the leader of the caravan said. Then he pointed to the next man and his umbrella. ""It hasn't rained in the desert for many years,"" he said. ""Why are you carrying an umbrella?""

"Question: Where did we travel to? Context: It was four o'clock when we left Micatlan,and we traveled quickly until it became almost completely dark.It was our intention to return to our general quarters in Atlacomulco that night.We had a long journey ahead of us,especially because it had been decided there was no way we would try to cross the ravines again at night,since they were considered far too dangerous.Futhermore,an eclipse of the moon was expected,and,in fact,while we were crossing an open field,the moon appeared on the horizon,half in shadow,a rare and beautiful sight. After a few hours of riding,we suddenly realized that we had lost our way,and worse still,had no way of finding it again.Night had fallen and there was not a single hut in sight,only great plains and mountains and the lowing of distant bulls all around us.We continued on ahead,trusting in luck,though it was difficult to say where she had brought us.By good fortune,our advance riders ran into two Indians,a man and a boy,who agreed to guide us their village and no further. After an interminable and exhausting road,which we traveled at a brisk trot,the barking of several dogs announced an Indian village.In the dying light,we could just make out cane huts,firmly situated between the banana trees,with fenced gardens in front of each one.Our convoy stopped in front of one particular hut,a kind of inn or shop for alcohol,where a naked goblin-like figure,the ideal husband for a witch,was serving cheap brandy to the Indians,most of whom were already drunk. We dismounted and threw ourselves to the ground,too tired to even think.Someone found us,God knows how,a cup of dreadful hot chocolate.We began to realize that we were completely lost,and so it was agreed to give up our attempt to reach Atlacomulco that night.Instead,we should head for the village of ""E1 Puente"",where our guides know a Spanish family,made up of several unmarried brothers,who,without any doubt,would be delighted to offer us a safe refuge for the rest of the night.We remounted and began our journey,a little restored after the pause in our journey and the dreadful hot chocolate. </s>"	Atlacomulco. </s>

"Question: Physician assistant degree ranks first on the list because _ . Context: Forbes set out to determine which master's degrees would provide the best long-term opportunities, based on salary and employment outlook. To find the mid-career average pay for 35 popular degrees, we turned to Payscale.com, which lets users compare their salaries with those of other people in similar jobs by gathering real-time salary data from its 35 million profiles. We then looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment estimate data to see how fast employment was expected to increase between 2010 and 2020 in popular jobs held by people with each degree. Finally we averaged each degree's pay rank and estimated growth rank to find the best and worst master's degrees for jobs. Physician assistant degree is at the top of the Forbes' third-annual look at the best master's degrees for jobs. Physician assistants are medical professionals who provide diagnostic and preventative health care services under the guidance of doctors. ""Both an aging population and health care reform are contributing to a higher demand for health care services,"" says Katie Bardaro, Payscale's lead economist. They don't earn as much as doctors, but their mid-career average pay is $97,000. Another advantage of a physician assistant degree: Employment opportunities are expected to grow 30% by 2020 (from the 2010 employment numbers), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By our count, computer science follows close behind as the No. 2 best advanced degree for jobs. Mid-career average pay for these grads is $109,000, sixth best out of the 35 degrees in our survey. Employment opportunities for computer science degree-holders are expected to expand about 22% between 2010 and 2020. Electrical engineering, physics and economics degrees also make the top 10, all with an average mid-career salary of more than $110,000 a year. Not all master's degree holders enjoy anywhere near such optimistic job prospects or extraordinary pay. Biology, chemistry and history degrees are toward the bottom of the list--but that doesn't mean they're useless. If you're enthusiastic about these fields, the lower pay and slimmer job prospects shouldn't prevent you from pursuing a master's. Before you make a decision, you should bear one thing in mind: master's degree-holders don't necessarily earn more than other people in similar jobs--so don't base your decision to pursue one on the idea that you'll bring in bigger paychecks. It's also important to think about work-life balance and employee satisfaction for the common jobs associated with these degrees. ""You need to consider overall happiness,"" Bardaro says. ""If obtaining a master's degree causes an imbalance due to time devoted to education and potentially more stress at work, then one will need to decide if these costs are worth it."" </s>"	The demand of physician assistants is expected to expand largely and they are well-paid. </s>

I turned into a sock shop that caught my eye, and a boy clerk who was about 17 came forward. ""What can I do for you, sir?"" There was a note of passion in his voice. ""Did you know that you have come into the finest place in the world to buy socks? Come with me,"" said the boy. I followed him to the back of the shop, and he began to take down from the shelves box after box of socks. ""I am going to buy only one pair!"" ""I know that,"" said he, ""but I want you to see how beautiful these are. Aren't they wonderful?"" I became far more interested in him than in the socks. I looked at him in surprise. ""My friend,"" said I, ""if you can keep this up, if this is not just the enthusiasm that comes from having a new job, if you can keep up this excitement day after day, in ten years you will be a good businessman."" My surprise at his pride and joy in his salesmanship will be easily understood by all who read this article. In many shops the customer has to wait for someone to serve him. And when finally some shop assistant notices you, you are made to feel as if you were interrupting him. He displays no interest either in you or in the goods he is paid to sell.

Question: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development tries to find out _ . Context: Not long ago, many people believed that babies only wanted food and to be kept warm and dry. Some people thought babies were not able to learn things until they were five or six months old. Yet doctors in the United States say babies begin learning on their first day of life. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is a federal government agency. Its goal is to determine which experiences can influence healthy development in people. Researchers at the institute note that babies are strongly influenced by their environment. They say a baby will smile if her mother does something the baby likes. A baby learns to get the best care possible by smiling to please her mother or other caregiver. This is how babies learn to connect and communicate with other people. The researchers say this ability to learn exists in a baby even before birth. They say newborn babies can recognize and understand sounds they heard while they were still developing inside their mothers. Another study has suggested that low birth weight babies with no evidence of disability may be more likely than other children to have physical and mental problems. American researchers studied almost five hundred boys and girls. They were born in, or admitted to, one of three hospitals in New Jersey between 1984 and 1987. At birth, each child weighed fewer than two thousand grams. The boys and girls had an average age of sixteen at the time of the study. They were asked to complete intelligence and motor skill tests in their homes. Their test results were compared with those of other children their age. </s>	what affects people's healthy development </s>

"Question: What led Albert Hofmann to a career in chemistry? Context: Albert Hofmann was a Swiss Scientist who was fascinated by nature. This led him to a career in chemistry in which he sought answers to his uncertainties. He worked at Sandoz Laboratories where he nurtured his research work, and there he made a lot of success by working with various plants and changing them into something useful. He became famous when he became the first person to produce lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) . In addition, he was also the first person to taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic effects. He was deeply connected to the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry , could also be used to promote awareness of mankind's place in nature. However, he was disappointed that his discovery was being carelessly used as a drug for entertainment. Because of his discovery, LSD fans have fondly called him ""The father of LSD"". Besides carrying out his scientific experiments, he also authored numerous books and more than 100 scientific articles. In 2007, he featured in a list of the 100 greatest living geniuses , published by The Telegraph Newspaper. Childhood & Early Life Albert Hofmann was born in Baden, Switzerland, on January 11, 1906.

He spent much of his childhood outdoors, and grew up with a very deep connection with nature. He had mind-blowing experiences in childhood, wherein nature was changed in magical ways that he didn't understand.

Question: How did the science teacher react to the accident? Context: Although in 1947 we were still very new to the atomic age, we knew about mushroom clouds. A huge crack spread across the library wall upstairs, sending teachers and students screaming down the hall. Had a new world war started? Pale-faced, our young science teacher quickly organized us for a fire drill. We huddled in little groups on the beach side of the school grounds and watched the spreading cloud darken the bright spring sky. Rumors flew every which way, although two hours would pass before we got the full story.One rumor we heard was that the Texas City Monsanto Chemical plant had blown up; children whose parents worked there began to weep. I froze--that was where my father was working that day. The school bell called us back inside, and we were dismissed to find our way home the best way we could. I-d walked a quarter of the three-mile trip to my home when a car horn startled me to attention. My Uncle Barney pulled up alongside me in his old Ford. The instant I saw him, I knew my father was gone. Otherwise, Papa would have come for me himself. As if in slow motion from a great distance, Uncle Barney motioned for me to get in. Numb with grief, I crawled into the back seat. I barely took notice of the man sitting there, and didn't recognize him until he reached for me. When Papa put his strong arms around me, I forgot for a moment that Cherokees aren't supposed to cry. Many of my fellow students lost their parents in the explosion. Tragedy would one day come to our family, as it inevitably comes to all, but on the day Texas City blew up, it miraculously passed us by. Because he lost his keys on that April morning, as he explained, my father lived for another 32 years-we were to have a second lifetime forever. </s>	He acted quickly. </s>
Question: According to the passage, why don't some people drink water straight from the kitchen faucet? Context: If your family is like many in the United States, keeping a lot of bottled water at home, it's easy to get a cold one right out of the fridge on your way to a soccer game or activity, right? But all those plastic bottles use a lot of fossil fuels and pollute the environment. In fact, Americans buy more bottled water than any other nation in the world, and add 29 billion water bottles a year to the problem. In order to make all these bottles, manufacturers use 17 million barrels of crude oil . That's enough oil to keep a million cars going for twelve months. So why don't more people drink water straight from the kitchen faucet? Some people drink bottled water because they think it is better for them than water out of the tap, but that's not true. In the US, local governments make sure water from the faucet is safe. People love the convenience of bottled water. But maybe if they realized the problems it causes, they would try drinking from a glass at home or carrying water in a refillable steel container instead of plastic. Unfortunately, for every six water bottles we use, only one makes it to the recycling bin. The rest are sent to landfills. Or, even worse, they end up as trash on the land and in rivers, lakes and the ocean. Plastic bottles take many hundreds of years to break down. Water is good for you, so keep drinking it. But think about how often you use water bottles, and see if you can make a change. And yes, you can make a difference. Remember this: recycling one plastic bottle can save enough energy to power a 60-watt light bulb for six hours. No matter who you are, you can do something for the environment.

"Question: The chief objective of the first of the six reports is to _ . Context: Health insurance is a great concern to Americans now. It's likely that many Americans lack health insurance with the economy having no sign of picking up. The National Academy of Sciences reported Thursday. ""Unless health insurance is made more affordable, the number of uninsured Americans is likely to continue growing over time,"" said Mary Sue Coleman, co-chairwoman of the committee that wrote the report. The report is the first six planned by the institute of Medicine over two years. The series is planned to find out who lacks health insurance and why, and determine what the consequences are and provide the groundwork for debate on how to correct the problem. The institute is part of the academy, a private organization supported by Congress to advise the government of scientific matters. This first report seeks to draw a picture of the millions who lack insurance. It does not offer any recommendations. ""Much of what Americans think they know about the uninsured is wrong,"" said Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a public health professor at Emory University Schools of Medicine in Atlanta, who also worked on the report. The Census Bureau reported last month that 38.7 million Americans went without coverage for all of 2000, compared with 39.3 million the year before, thanks to the booming economy. Experts say the trend is likely to reverse this year, given that the economy was slowing even before the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks. ""Unfortunately, the recent economic slowdown might have reversed the modest gains in coverage for shorter periods."" The report said that with insurance costs rising, more employers and individuals may conclude they are unable to afford coverage. Premium increases were often absorbed by employers in the strong economy of the 1990s, but that may not continue as the economy softens, the report said. The panel found that about 13.6 million of the uninsured work for employers that do not offer health insurance. Individually purchased coverage may be prohibitively costly. </s>"	find out who lack health insurance </s>
"Question: Aviad Sheinin's words suggest that _ . Context: Dozens of dolphins swam out of the polluted waters of Haifa Harbor on Tuesday.This was the first time that dolphins had visited this crowded Mediterranean port,and researchers were surprised and delighted by the unexpected event. Between 40 and 50 of the dolphins appeared in the busy port on Tuesday morning,obviously drawn by the fishrich waters of Haifa Harbor. However,the bay is also full of harmful chemicals. Aviad Sheinin,professor of Haifa University's Maritime Studies Department,said he didn't think the dolphins were harmed by the pollution,but he hoped that they would swim back to the sea soon. ""It seems that they are quite relaxed. They don't seem to be stressed,"" he said. Haifa Harbor is lined by chemical companies that have been pouring poisonous waste into the water for decades. While pollution levels have dropped in recent years,the water is still considered a health hazard. ""There are lots of fish in Haifa Harbor. Unfortunately we couldn't tell the dolphins that the fish are not healthy;and I don't know what the result will be,"" he told Israel Army Radio.Hundreds of Haifa residents gathered around Haifa Harbor to see the interesting sight,and researchers said this provided a rare chance to film and study the roughtoothed dolphins.

Question: It can be inferred that _ . Context: Understanding the process of making career choices and managing your career is a basic life skill that everyone should understand. Your career decisions have such a profound effect on all aspects of your life. It's important to have the knowledge and resources needed to make smart, informed decisions. Whether you are looking for a new job, aiming to take the next step at your current job or planning your retirement options, you are making career decisions. Using good resources and the guidance of a career counselor can help you to make those decisions well. Many people mistakenly believe that choosing a career is a one-time event that happens some time in early adulthood. However, career management is actually a life-long process, and we continue to make consequential career choices over the years. When people want to take action in their career, career management and job search are about so much more than writing a good resume. If you learn about and act on the following areas of career management, you'll be rewarded throughout your career. Your interests, abilities, values, personal needs and realities should all be taken into account in any career decision making process. You spend countless hours at work, and it impacts your life in so many ways; it makes sense that you should be fully informed before making such profound decisions. Do you know how many different career choices are available to you? Both The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (American) and The National Occupational Classification (Canadian) list well over 20,000 different job titles. So unless you've actively explored a variety of career options, there's a very good chance that there are great possibilities available to you, and you don't even realize they exist. Match your understanding of yourself with your understanding of possible career options. Once you have developed a good understanding of yourself, you will be able to combine that self-knowledge with your career and labor market research to determine potential careers that are a great fit for you. When you've made a well informed decision, then you're ready to make it happen. Making use of good career guidance and resources will help you to acquire the education, skills, and experience needed to get the job and learn and implement effective job search strategies. Time spent understanding your needs, researching your career options and developing outstanding job search skills, guided by great career resources, is a powerful investment in your future. </s>	career decision is misunderstood by many people because they don't take it as a life-long process </s>
Question: When the author went to Howard University, her dream was tobe Context: In the fall of 1985. I was a bright-eyed girl heading off to Howard University, aiming at a legal career and dreaming of sitting on a Supreme Court bench somewhere. Twenty-one years later I am later I am still a bright-eyed dreamer and one with quite a different tale to tell. My grandma, an amazing woman, graduated from college an the age of 65. She was the first in our family to reach that goal. But one year after I started college, she developed cancer. I made the choice to withdraw from college to care for her. It meant that school and my personal dream would have to wait. Then I got married with another dream: building my family with a combination of adopt and biological children. In 1999, we adopted our first son. To lay eyes on him was fantastic---and very emotional. A year later came our second adopted boy. Then followed son No. 3. In 2003, I gave birth to another boy. You can imagine how fully occupied I became, raising four boys under the age of 81. Our home was a complete zoo---a joyous zoo. Not surprising, I never did make it back to college full-time. But I never gave up on the dream either. I had only one choice: to find a way. That meant talking as few as one class each semester. The hardest part was feeling guilty about the time I spent away from the boys. They often wanted me to stay home with them. There certainly were times I wanted to quit, But I knew I should set an example for them to follow through the rest of their lives. In 2007, I graduated from the University of North Carolina. It took me over 21 years to get my college degree! I am not special, just single-minded. It always struck me that when you're looking at a big challenge from the outside it looks huge, but when you're in the midst of it, it just seems normal.

"Question: What can we learn from the passage? Context: At the end of my senior year of high school, I got a job working at a local coffee shop.I thought the job would be easy and stress-free.I pictured myself pouring the best coffees, making delicious doughnuts , and becoming friends with regular customers. I wasn't expecting the people with enormous orders, the women who complained that the coffee was much too creamy , or the men who wanted their iced coffees remade again and again until they reached perfection.I couldn't seem to please anyone. One rainy day, one of my regular customers came in looking upset.He said he felt like getting in bed, pulling the sheets up over his head, and staying there for a few years.I knew exactly how he felt. Before he left, I handed him a bag along with his iced coffee.He was surprised, since he hadn't ordered anything but coffee.I had given him his favorite type of droughnut.

The next day, it was still raining.I spent my afternoon hanging out the window handing people their orders.I was completely wet and freezing cold.Worse, no one was tipping that day.Every time I looked into our empty tip jar, I grew more depressed. In the evening, the customer from the day before drove up to the window.He handed me a pink rose and a note.He said that not many people took time to care about others and he was glad there were still people like me in the world.With a friendly wave, he drove away. I ran to the back of the shop and read the note.It read: Christine, Thanks for being so sweet, kind and thoughtful yesterday.It is so nice to meet someone who's indeed nice.Please don't change your ways!

"Question: People tend to believe that _ . Context: Contrary to popular belief, looking at someone's face alone is not enough to tell us whether they are roaring in celebration or screaming in frustration, researchers claimed.While people may believe they have the ability to read each other's faces, body language is the real clue that shows whether strong emotions someone is feeling are positive or negative. In a study, groups of participants were shown a series of facial expressions such as tennis players photographed just after winning or losing a point. In some cases the volunteers were able to see the player's full body, but in others they were only shown either their face or their body with the other removed. Participants could clearly tell whether the players were winning or losing when they were shown the full picture or just the body, but their guesses were no better than chance when based on the face alone. Those who were allowed to see the full image were convinced they had made their judgment based on the players' facial expressions even though results from the two other groups suggested otherwise. The researchers carried out a second study where participants were shown a wider range of faces showing emotions including joy, pleasure, victory, pain and defeat. Using photoediting software, the researchers attached the faces to bodies expressing the opposite emotion, and asked participants to act out the emotions they saw in the photos. The resulting poses were like the body poses in the photographs but not the facial expressions, demonstrating that people base their interpretation of strong emotions not on the face but the body. Dr Aviezer, who led the study, said, ""These results show that when emotions become extremely intense, the difference between positive and negative facial expressions becomes unclear.The results may help researchers understand how our body interacts during emotional situations.For example, individuals may fail to recognize facial expressions, but if they are trained to process important body language, their performance may significantly improve."" </s>"	someone's feelings can be read by their facial expressions </s>
Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Context: As we all know, the ocean moves. But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. </s>	Wave energy comes from the water. </s>
Question: The test conducted by Buffler shows that when a person feels comfortable warmth, he receives about _ . Context: Microwaves may be great at warming up food, but what about warming people? Using microwaves to directly heat owners of a room would save much of the energy wasted by heating walls and furniture. And despite popular ideas about microwaves, this technique would be safe, according to Charles R. Burlier of the Microwave Research Center in Marlborough, New Hampshire. Low-power microwaves only penetrate the skin (low-power microwave penetration in a ham is about 0.2 inches, for example) and with no negative effects. To test this idea, Buffler subjected himself to microwaves in a special room using a standard 500-watt, 2459 MHz magnetron . He found that a person will start to feel warmth at about 20 milliwatts per square centimeter (mw. / sq. cm. ) ; a satisfactory feeling of warmth occurs between 35 and 50mw. / sq. cm. By comparison, a person standing in noonday summer sun feels the amount of 85 mw. / sq. cm. And a frozen meat pie in your microwave oven receives about 1000 mw. / sq. cm. In houses of the future, each room could be provided with its own magnetron, says Buffler. When you stepped into the living room, for example, a motion detector would turn on the magnetron, filling the room with low-power microwaves. In the same way that a microwave oven heats up a hamburger, but not the plate it's on, you would feel warmth from the microwaves without changing the temperature of your coffee table. (You could, however, make your favorite easy chair even more comfortable by treating it with a radiation-absorbing chemical.) While it might be some time before homeowners are comfortable enough with the idea to set up whole-body microwave heaters in houses, Buffler says microwaves may attract livestock farmers. Lambs that are born outdoors in winter, for example, are frequently lost to cold. Microwaves could warm the lambs safely and quickly. </s>	40 mw. / sq. cm. </s>
Question: What would be the best title for the passage? Context: In the Middle Ages in Europe, theater was an important part of civic, economic and religious life. During this period after the fall of Roman civilization, many cities were destroyed. Southern and Western Europe, famous for its agriculture, became increasingly more agricultural. After several hundred years, many towns appeared again. The Roman Catholic Church took over religion, education and politics. What remained of theater was mostly on the Greek and Roman performing arts. Theater was reborn as liturgical dramas. It was written in Latin and dealing with biblical stories which would be performed by church members. Then there came local dramas spoken in common language not Latin. They were more wonderful one-act dramas taking place in town squares or other parts of the city. There were three types of local dramas. Mystery or cycle plays were short dramas based on biblical stories organized into historical cycles. Miracle plays dealt with the lives of the great. Morality plays taught a lesson through characters standing for good or bad qualities. Secular plays in this period existed, but religious drama in the Middle Ages is mostly remembered today. As the Middle Ages ended, the number of religious theatres became small as the church weakened and more secular qualities won over religious theaters. </s>	Religious theatres in the Middle Ages </s>

""Our findings suggest that Facebook is not replacing face-to-face interactions between friends, family and colleagues,"" said S.Craig Watkins, an associate professor of radio, TV and film who headed the research team.

"Question: The mimic climbs to the lion's cage because _ . Context: One day an out of work mimic is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performer. As soon as he starts to draw the crowd,a zoo keeper grabs him and drags him into his office. The zoo keeper explains to the mimic that the zoo's most popular attraction,a gorilla ,has died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off. He offers the mimic a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one. The mimic accepts. So the next morning the mimic puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before the crowd comes. He discovers that it's a great job. He can sleep all he wants,play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mimic. However,eventually the crowds tire of him and he tires of just swinging on wires. He begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his. Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience,he climbs to the top of his cage,crawls across a partition ,and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. Of course,this makes the lion very angry,but the crowd loves it. At the end of the day the zoo keeper comes and gives the mimic a raise for being such a good attraction. Well,this goes on for some time-the mimic keeps taunting the lion,the crowds grow larger,and his salary keeps going up. Then one terrible day when he is dangling over the angry lion he slips and falls. The mimic is terrified. The lion gathers itself and prepares to attack. The mimic is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind. Finally,the mimic starts screaming and yelling,""Help me,help me!""But the lion is quick and attacks. The mimic soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says,""Shut up,you idiot!Do you want to get us both fired?"" </s>"	he wants to attract the attention of his audience </s>

Question: The best title for the passage is _ . Context: There is no doubt that mothers play an important leading role in the lives of their children. But what about a father's role? I believe that fathers play just as important a role as mothers. Fathers give us support. They are the shore we swim to when our arms and legs feel increasingly tired. They are the strength we rely on as we take our first steps into the world. Fathers can be gentle and powerful, but they probably have the simplest love we ever know. _ , the father is their first hero and possibly the only man they will ever feel comfortable loving. For daughters, the father is the first man they admire and the first man whose eyes shine with happiness when they look at them. He is the first man to fall in love with them. For mothers, the father of our children is the person we can believe in to watch over the babies as closely as we would. We are protectedin the knowledge of their love. A father is the person on the planet with whom we can do whatever we want ... one who will be just as interested and never feel bored in the face of our devotion. Without fathers, we wouldn't be mums. I would like to thank them from all our hearts for this honor and for being our partners in the business of raising children. </s>	The importance of fathers </s>

In time you will meet up with other people who think they have all the answers. These people are called bosses. My advice is: humor them. A little later you'll meet additional people who think they have all the answers. These are called spouses . My advice is: humor them, too. And of all goes well, in a few years you will meet still another group of people who think they have all the answers. These are called children. Humor them. Life will go on, your children will grow up, go to school and someday they could be taking part in a graduation ceremony just like this one. And who knows, the speakers responsible for handing out good advice might be you. Halfway through your speech, the graduate sitting next to your daughter will lean over and ask, ""Who is that woman up there who thinks she has all the answers?""

"Question: Which of the following is WRONG according to the passage? Context: It's not just great minds that think alike. Dozens of the genes involved in the vocal learning that _ human speech are also active in some songbirds . And knowing this suggests that birds could become a standard model for investigating the genetics of speech production and speech disorders. Complex language is a uniquely human trait, but vocal learning -- the ability to pick up new sounds by imitating others -- is not. Some mammals, including whales, dolphins and elephants, share our ability to learn new vocalizations . So do three groups of birds: the songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds. The similarities between vocal learning in humans and birds are not just superficial. We know, for instance, that songbirds have specialised vocal learning brain circuits that are similar to those that mediate human speech. What's more, a decade ago we learned that FOXP2, a gene known to be involved in human language, is also active in ""area X"" of the songbird brain -- one of the brain regions involved in those specialised vocal learning circuits. Andreas Pfenning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues have now built on these discoveries. They compared maps of genetic activity in brain tissue taken from the zebra finch, budgerigar and Anna's hummingbird, representing the three groups of vocal-learning birds. They then compared these genetic maps with others taken from birds and primates that can't learn new vocalisations, and with maps taken from the brains of six people who donated tissue to the Allen Brain Institute in Seattle. Their results showed that FOXP2 is just one of 55 genes that show a similar pattern of activity in the brains of humans and the vocal-learning birds. Those same genes show different patterns of activity in the brains of animals incapable of vocal learning. ""The similarities are beyond one or a handful of genes,"" says Pfenning. ""There are just systematic molecular similarities between song-learning birds and humans."" ""There's potential for songbirds to be used to study neurodegeneration -- especially conditions like Huntington's,"" says Pfenning. Huntington's disease affects the ability to produce complex motor behaviour, such as singing and talking, so experiments with birds might implicate particular genes in the disease. Constance Scharff at the Free University of Berlin in Germany, who helped identify the importance of FOXP2 for vocal learning in birds agrees that songbirds can make great models for human speech and its pathologies . ""My lab's research during the past 10 years has shown that FOXP2 is as relevant for birds' song learning as it is for human speech learning,"" she says. </s>"	Songbirds have the same vocal learning brain circuits as human. </s>
"Question: What can we infer from the passage? Context: All Ric O Barry wants is to stop the dolphinkilling, so he is headed to this seaside Japanese town, Taiji.The American activist, who is the star of a new awardwinning documentary that portrays the dolphinkilling here, got an unwelcome reception when he showed up here this week for the start of the annual hunt. His movie, The Cove , directed by National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos, was released in the United States a month ago but has not yet to come out in Japan. Scenes in the film, some of which were shot secretly, show fishermen banging on metal poles stuck in the water to create a wall of sound that scares the dolphins-- which have supersensitive sonar --and sends them fleeing into a cove. There, the fishermen sometimes pick a few to be sold for aquarium shows, for as much as $150,000. They kill the others, spearing the animals repeatedly until the water turns red. The meat from one dolphin is worth about 50,000 yen, and is sold at supermarkets across Japan. Greenpeace and other groups have tried to stop the hunt for years.Activists hope The Cove will bring the issue to more people internationally--and eventually in Japan. Already,the Australian town of Broome dropped its 28year sistercity relationship with Taiji last month,partly because of the movie. ""Some regions have a tradition of eating dolphin meat,"" said fisheries official Toshinori Uoya. ""Dolphinkilling may be negative for our international image, but it is not something orders can stop."" The town government in Taiji--which has made whales and dolphins its trademark--refused to comment about The Cove, or the growing international criticism against dolphinkilling. Many in Taiji take the dolphin hunt for granted as part of everyday life. They are _ about The Cove,seeing themselves as powerless victims of overseas pressure to end a simple and honest way of making a living. </s>"	The Cove has brought international attention to dolphinkilling. </s>
"Question: While talking about textbooks, the author seems to think that_. Context: Few, if any, instruments shape national culture more powerfully than the materials used in schools. Textbooks are not only among the first books most people meet; in many places they are, along with religious texts, almost the only books they have. A study in South Africa showed that fewer than half of pupils had access to more than ten books at home. In 2010 a study by Egypt's government found that, apart from school textbooks, 88% of Egyptian households read no books. The degree to which a government keeps control of the textbooks used in classrooms is a good guide to its commitment to ideological control. Where that desire is strong, governments are likely to produce the textbooks themselves or define carefully what goes into them. America's State Department employs people to keep an eye on other countries' textbooks, in an effort to understand better how their people think and what their governments want them to think. Other countries probably do the same. Textbooks have long been a source of worry. After the attacks on America on September 11th 2001, some in both America and Saudi Arabia, including officials, supposed that Saudi Arabia's curriculum of intolerance was responsible, at least in part, for the emergence of al-Qaeda . Sometimes the requirements of the state are more clearly seen in what textbooks leave out. The world has long criticized Japan for the way its textbooks whitewash the country's history, in particular dressing up Japanese war crimes. The ""New History Textbook"", for example, which was submitted for government approval in 2000, played down Japan's aggression in the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-95 and the occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, and avoided mention of the use of sex slaves by its armies or the rape of Nanjing. In America most of the disputes about textbooks are home-grown. Liberals worry that their children are being taught a nationalistic version of history that emphasizes the wonders of industrialization and plays down slavery and the killing of Indian tribes. By contrast, Conservatives complain about inadequate education of love for their country and too much secularism . In 2010 the Texas board of education managed to remove Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, from the state's list of important revolutionary figures, apparently because of Jefferson's insistence on the separation of church and state. He was, however, swiftly restored. As long as textbooks are issued or approved by the state, they will remain a political issue. But as access to other textbooks is enjoyed more widely, some of the dominance they now enjoy will weaken. </s>"	they are not necessarily so </s>
"Question: What is NOT true about the Rennsteig? Context: More and more people take part in marathons these days - over 30,000 people will run the London Marathon this weekend, for instance. But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. ""I have to admit to being completely frustrated by the blocking and for 18-19 miles was just keeping away from people and being held up,"" one participant grumbled after the 2012 London Marathon. ""I had to overtake a lot of people and ended up with bruised forearms from all the elbows,"" said another. How do such crowding problems arise, and could they be reduced? Some researchers believe that we can find the answers through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber's model of a marathon uses this same principle that the flow rate first increases and then decreases as the density of runners increases, thanks to an sudden switch from free to crowded flow. He assumes that there is a range of different preferred speeds for different runners, which each maintains throughout the race. With just these factors, Treiber can calculate the flow rate of runners, knowing the ""carrying capacity"" at each point on the route. This allows Treiber to figure out how blocking might depend on the race conditions - for example, for different starting procedures. Some marathons start by letting all the runners set off at once (which means those at the back have to wait until those in front have moved forward). Others assign runners to various groups according to ability, and let them start in a series of waves. Treiber has applied the model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely. It could pass either over a 60m wooden bridge or through a tunnel. Treiber used his model to predict the likely blocking caused in the various options. The model predicted that a mass start would risk an overload of runners if the bridge were to be used. Only by moving the starting point further back from the bridge could the danger be avoided - and even then, if some of the numbers assumed in the model were only slightly inaccurate, there was still a risk of jams at the bridge. On the other hand, no dangerous blocking seemed likely for the tunnel route. The run organizers consulted Treiber's team, and eventually chose this option. </s>"	The route was changed because the traditional one is not safe any longer. </s>
Question: According to the passage, what has been affected in Italy by rising sea levels? Context: Earlier this month, the Obama Administration called for increased protection of the world's most southern continent, Antarctica.Scientists say climate change and human activity have increasingly led to the melting of massive pieces of Antarctic ice.The disappearance of ice will not only affect wildlife in the area such as seals and penguins.The melting will also cause oceans and seas around the world to rise. This represents a major threat, especially to coastal areas.For example, the ancient city of Venice, Italy has long been threatened by rising sea levels.The situation is made worse by the fact that its ancient buildings, built on a body of water called a lagoon , are slowly sinking.When the city was founded about 1,600 years ago, the level of the Adriatic Sea was almost two meters lower than it is today. Rising sea levels are not the only threat.The salty water is also destroying Venice's famous buildings and artworks.The Italian government is trying to fix the problem with the construction of a seven-billion-dollar system of moving flood barriers. Climate change is also leading to the melting of ice in other areas, such as Mount Kilimanjaro in northeastern Tanzania.It is the highest point in Africa, measuring almost 6,000 meters.The mountain supports five vegetation zones and many kinds of animals. The ice glaciers on the mountain are disappearing very quickly.This will have a bad effect on the mountain's ecosystems and on Tanzania's travel industry.Also, a valuable record of thousands of years of weather history will also be lost if the ice melts.Scientists study pieces of glacier to understand weather patterns from thousands of years ago. In the United States, the icy masses in Glacier National Park in Montana may soon completely disappear because of climate change.In 1850, there were an estimated 150 glaciers in the more than 400,000 hectare park. There are 26 glaciers remaining today.Scientists estimate that the glaciers will be gone by 2030.Warming temperatures are also threatening the many kinds of plants and animals that live in this mountain ecosystem. </s>	Its ancient buildings could be drowned. </s>

Wikipedia is built differently from almost every other top 50 website. We have a small number of paid staff,just twenty-three. Wikipedia content is free to use by anyone for any purpose. Our annual expenses are less than six million dollars. Wikipedia is run by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation,which I founded in 2003. Wikipedia is driven by a global community of more than 150,000 volunteers--all devoted to sharing knowledge freely. Over almost eight years,these volunteers have contributed more than 11 million articles in 265 languages. More than 275 million people come to our website every month to access information,free of charge and free of advertising. But Wikipedia is more than a website. We share a common cause:Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. _ 's our commitment. Your donation helps us in several ways. Most importantly,you will help us cover the increasing cost of managing global traffic to one of the most popular websites on the Internet. Funds also help us improve the software that runs Wikipedia--making it easier to search,easier to read,and easier to write for. We are committed to increasing the free knowledge movement worldwide,by taking on new volunteers,and building strategic partnerships with institutions of culture and learning. Wikipedia is different. It's the largest encyclopedia in history,written by volunteers. Like a national park or a school,we don't believe advertising should have a place in Wikipedia.

The study, released by the Newspaper Association of America, underlines the internet' s importance to papers beset by failing circulation and advertising income in their print editions. The average number of unique visitors to online newspaper sites in the first half was more than 55.5 million a month ,the study said. That compares with 42.2 million a year earlier. ""Newspaper websites have become a significant addition to the print product, and are driving large audience growth, "" said John Kimball9the association' s chief marketing officer. The number of page views at newspaper sites rose by about 52 percent in the first half, the association added. US Newspaper publishers have been fighting to hold on to advertisers as many of them lose readers to other media, including the Internet, Key to the latest report is the finding that websites are bringing in more younger readers, the association said. The Washington Post, s website increased its audience reachamong readers aged25 to 34 by more than 60 percent, the report said.

Question: The servants were up very late because _ . Context: Pepys and his wife had asked some friends to dinner on Sunday, September 2nd, 1666. The servants were up very late on the Saturday evening, getting everything ready for the next day, and while they were busy they saw the glow of a fire start in the sky. By 3 o'clock on the Sunday morning, the glow had become so bright that one of the servants, Jane, woke her master to see it. Pepys went to the window to watch it. It seemed fairly far away, so after a time he went back to bed. When he got up in the morning, it looked as though the fire was dying down, though he could still see some flames. So he set to work to tidy his room and put his things back where he wanted them after the servants had cleaned everything. While he was doing this, Jane came in to say that she had heard that the fire was a bad one: three hundred houses had been burned down in the night and the fire was still burning. Pepys went out to see for himself. He went to the Tower of London and climbed up on a high part of the building so that he could see what was happening. From there, Pepys could see that it was, indeed, a bad fire and that even the houses on London Bridge were burning. Someone told him that the fire had started in a baker's house in Pudding Lane, and then the flames had quickly spread to the other houses in the narrow lane. So began the Great Fire of London, a fire that lasted nearly five days, damaged most of the old city and ended, so it is said, at Pie Corner. </s>	they were preparing for a dinner </s>
Question: The Hungarian woman became a hyper-polyglot mainly because of her _ . Context: It is not unusual for people to speak two or three languages; they're known as bilinguals or trilinguals. Speakers of more than three languages are known as polyglots. And when we refer to people who speak many languages, perhaps a dozen or more, we use the term hyper-polyglot. The most famous hyper-polyglot was Giuseppe Mezzofanti, a 19thcentury Italian cardinal, who was said to speak 72 languages. This claim sounds absurd. _ But Mezzofanti was tested by critics, and they were all impressed. Did Mezzofanti have an extraordinary brain? Or are hyper-polyglots just ordinary people with ordinary brains who manage to do something extraordinary through hard work? U.S. linguist Stephen Drashen believes that outstanding language learners just work harder at it and then they acquire unusually strong language ability. As an example, he mentions a Hungarian woman who worked as an interpreter during the 20thcentury. When she was 86, she could speak 16 languages and was still working on learning new languages. She said she learned them mostly on her own, reading fiction or working through dictionaries or textbooks. Some researchers argue to the contrary. They believe that there is such a thing as a talent for learning languages. In the 1930s, a German scientist examined parts of the preserved brain of a hyper-polyglot named Emil Krebs, who could speak 60 languages fluently. The scientist found that the area of Krebs's brain called Broca's area, which is associated with language, looked different from the Broca's area in the brains of men who speak only one language. However, we still don't know if Krebs was born with a brain ready to learn dozens of languages or if his brain adapted to the demands he put on it. Although it is still not clear whether the ability to learn many languages is in born, there's no doubt that just about all of us can acquire skills in a second, third, or even fourth language by putting our mind to it. </s>	hard work </s>

Question: What do we learn about the National Arboretum according to the passage? Context: Washington, D.C. is home to famous buildings, memorials and museums that visitors love. But it is also home to a large and beautiful green space. There are many _ in the city. Today, we take you to the United States National Arboretum, an active center for both scientific research and public education. Many people who come to Washington are astonished when they first visit the National Arboretum. The Arboretum is only a short drive from the center of the city. However, visitors often feel like they are remote from the busy American capital. The Arboretum covers one hundred eighty hectares of green space in the northeast part of Washington. The area is famous for its beautiful flowers, tall trees and other plants. About nine thousand different kinds of plants grow there. The National Arboretum was established by an act of Congress in 1927. Today, the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service operates the Arboretum. The goal of the Arboretum is to carry out studies and provide education in an effort to improve the environment. The goal includes protecting trees, flowers and other plants and showing them to the public. The National Arboretum is a popular stop for visitors to Washington. It is open every day of the year except December twenty-fifth, the Christmas holiday. Money is not necessary to visit the Arboretum. As many as six hundred thousand people visit the Arboretum's grounds each year. Hundreds of thousands of people also visit with the help of computers. They use the Arboretum's Internet web site to learn about current research programmes and how to care for plants. Director Thomas Elias says Arboretum officials would like to see even more visitors. He says they believe that many people do not know it exists. Part of the problem might result from the fact that the Arboretum is about five kilometers from the closest train station. Many famous places in Washington are a short walk from Metrorail, the local train system. The Arboretum is easy to reach by automobile or bus, however. About fifteen kilometers of roads have been built on the property. The roads connect to major collections and seasonal flowers. The Arboretum also welcomes people on bicycles. Disabled persons or those who want to walk only short distances may visit four beautiful areas that are close to each other. </s>	It is surprising and attractive. </s>
"Question: Farmer Joe _ . Context: One day, my friend Jimmy told me a story. Farmer Joe was in his cart when he was hit by a truck. He decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough to take the trucking company (which caused the accident)to court. In court the trucking company's lawyer was questioning Farmer Joe.

The lawyer interrupted again and said, ""Judge, I am trying to make clear the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the police on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to cover the fact. I believe he is telling lies. Please tell him to simply answer the question."" By this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule Bessie."" Joe thanked the Judge and went on, ""Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the cart and was driving her down the road when this huge truck ran into the stop sign and pushed my cart right in the side. I was thrown into one side and Bessie was thrown into the other."" ""I was hurt so badly that I didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie breathing loudly and groaning . I knew she was in great pain. Shortly after the accident a traffic policeman came to the scene. He could hear Bessie groaning so he went over to her.

"Question: Why did GG become very emotional on a December afternoon? Context: When my grandfather died, my 83-year-old grandmother, once so full of life, slowly began to fade. No longer able to manage a home of her own, she moved in with my mother, where she was visited often by other members of her large, loving family. Although she still had her good days, it was often hard to arouse her interest. But one chilly December afternoon three years ago, my daughter Meagan, then eight, and I were visiting her, when she noticed that Meagan was carrying her favorite doll.""I, too, had a special doll when I was a little girl,"" she told a wide-eyed Meagan. ""I got it one Christmas when I was about your age. I lived in an old farmhouse in Maine, with Mom, Dad and my four sisters, and the very first gift I opened that Christmas was the most beautiful doll you'd ever want to see."" ""She had an exquisite(,), hand-painted face, and her long brown hair was pulled back with a big pink bow. Her eyes were blue, and they opened and closed. I remember she had a body of kidskin, and her arms and legs bent at the joints."" GG's voice dropped low, taking on an almost respectful tone. ""My doll was dressed in a pretty pink gown, decorated with fine lace. ... _ -- my parents must have had to sacrifice so much to afford it But how happy I was that morning!"" GG's eyes filled and her voice shook with emotion as she recalled that Christmas of long ago. ""I played with my doll all morning long. And then it happened. My mother called us to the dining room for Christmas dinner and I laid my new doll down gently on the hall table. But as I went to join the family at the table, I heard a loud crash."" ""I hardly had to turn around -- I knew it was my precious doll. And it was. Her lace skirt had hung down from the table just enough for my baby sister to reach up and pull on it. When I ran in, there lay my beautiful doll on the floor, her face smashed into a dozen pieces. She was gone forever."" A few years later, GG's baby sister was also gone, she told Meagan, a victim of pneumonia . Now the tears in her eyes spilled over -- tears, I knew, not only for a lost doll and a lost sister, but for a lost time. Subdued for the rest of the visit, Meagan was no sooner in the car going home than she exclaimed, ""Mom, I have a great idea! Let's get GG a new doll for Christmas. Then she won't cry when she thinks about it."" My heart filled with pride as I listened to my sympathetic little daughter. But where would we find a doll to match GG's fond memories? Where there's a will, as they say, there's a way. When I told my best friends, Liz and Chris, about my problem, Liz put me in touch with a local doll-make. From a doll supply house I ordered a long brown hair and a kidskin body to copy the outfit GG had so lovingly described. Liz volunteered to put the doll together, and Chris helped me make the doll's outfit. Meagan wrote the story of the lost doll by giving examples. Finally our creation was finished. To our eyes it was perfect. But there was no way it could be exactly like the doll GG had loved so much and lost. Would she think it looked anything like it? On Christmas Eve, Meagan and I carried our happily packed gift to GG, where she sat surrounded by children, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. ""It's for you,"" Meagan said, ""but first you have to read the story that goes with it."" GG no sooner got through the first page than her voice cracked and she was unable to go on, but Meagan took over where she left off. Then it was time to open her present. I'll never forget the look on GG's face as she lifted the doll and held it to her chest. Once again her tears fell, but this time they were tears of joy. Holding the doll in her frail arms, she repeated over and over again, ""She's exactly like my old doll, exactly like her."" And perhaps she wasn't saying that just to be kind. Perhaps however impossible it seemed, we had managed to produce a close copy of the doll she remembered. But as I watched my eight-year-old daughter and her great-grandmother examining the doll together, I thought of a likelier explanation. What GG really recognized, perhaps, was the love that inspired the gift. And love, wherever it comes from, always looks the same. </s>"	Because she saw her great granddaughter's doll. </s>

Question: What dose the strategic planning mean? Context: Recently, I took part in the first strategic planning meeting at school. I didn't know what strategic planning meant when I was invited. So I set about trying to find out what it was. Later, I learnt it meant setting short and long term goals . The meeting took place in Ms Gallup's room on Tuesday after school. I really didn't know what to expect. I was very nervous ,but I felt very lucky to have been included. I really wanted to do the best I could. The desks in the room were laid out into two circles so that the upper school and lower school could be divided. There were fifteen students in the room. We were directed to discuss how to _ the school, what we'd like to be taught, and what we thought could be improved upon. I felt this was a very important responsibility as I was representing the fourth grade. So I tried to do the best I could. There were a lot of suggestions on how to improve our school. One student felt that the uniform sweater policy was really important and another student felt that building a paintable field would help improve the school greatly. I suggested that we should have Chinese classes because China is the most highly populated place on Earth with a growing industrial power. We should learn how to communicate with the Chinese . We discussed a lot and sometimes the discussion became heated, but they were interesting. I think it is amazing that the teacher asked the students about their opinions and gave us a voice. It is exciting if they adopt any of our suggestions. </s>	It means setting short and long term goals. </s>

But, the one ""latest things"" we have refused to buy is a mobile phone. Our twelve-year-old son wants one, and we've said ""no"". He says he'll only use it for texting and he really needs it for emergencies. We don't want him to have a mobile phone, because it may be bad for children's health. Unfortunately, when I say, ""As your father, I don't want you to have a mobile phone, because you might get a brain tumour ,"" he tells me that he doesn't mind. Why do twelve-year-old boys only want things that are bad for them? We've already told him that he can't listen to rap music--the words are disgusting . And I've said no to beer with his meals. Right now I'm saying no to everything. Then a few weeks ago he asked for something called a BB gun. He says everybody's got one. Of course they have. He shows me a website full of them and tells me it only fires plastic pellets . Finally, I say yes. I can't believe I've said no to phones and yes to guns.

"Question: Why do elderly people benefit much from the fingerprint machine? Context: A new system that scans customers' fingerprints and subtracts the grocery bill from their bank accounts has taken supermarkets in Germany to use the new system. ""Almost a quarter of our customers pay with their fingers,"" said an employee at the headquarters. Edeka has tried the system at 70 of its supermarkets. It says it will introduce it at 200 others because customers like it. ""At first we thought that only the young who really keep up with the latest technology would be interested, but we were wrong,"" said Stefan Sewoester from IT Werke. ""Almost two-thirds of the people who use the system are 40 and older,"" he said. IT Werke, a computer company, is one of the pioneers of fingerprint payment software in Germany. It has helped about 150 shops, canteens and bars to put in the fingerprint scanning machines. Each costs about 2,000 euros. To sign up for the service, customers must have their fingerprints taken and leave their addresses and banking details with the shop. The shop then takes the cost of goods directly out of the customer's bank account. ""It is especially a good thing for elderly people. Now they do not have to remember their pin to pay with their bank cards, or to scratch around for their glasses or cash."" Sewoester said. The stores benefit from the system too. It saves more than time in the check-out line. It also cuts out the hidden costs of accepting electronic card payments. </s>"	They will spend less time on shopping.. </s>
Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Context: Nuclear power's danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be summed up in one word: radiation. Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die for cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. </s>	The mystery about nuclear radiation. </s>

Should I give history up?"" Maybe you are right. After you leave school, it's not necessary for you to understand everything. But please remember that at school,besides getting knowledge, you should pay attention to some other important things. First, try to find what you are most interested in. At school, you study many subjects. Try to find what you like and what you don't like. This may be helpful to you in the future. Second, maybe you don't like math and you want to drop it. But the logical thinking ability from math can help you solve some problems.At school, you should practice your brain by thinking. Third, you should believe in yourself. Maybe you learn French at school, but you don't need to speak French at all.But learning French can prove that you have the ability of learning languages. Suppose you go to France one day and find a good job well. At school I learned French well, and now I must be able to learn German. But if you have no confidence, what will happen? Try to challenge yourself as often as possible. I think many of us like playing computer games. When we fail in a game, we always want to try it again. Why? Because it is hard for us to get the highest mark. If we want to challenge ourselves, we must face more difficult things and make greater progress. </s>"	have confidence in learning languages </s>
"Question: When the eyes are sore tears are produced to _ . Context: Many people believe the glare from snow causes snow-blindness. Yet, dark glasses or not , they find themselves suffering from headaches and watering eyes, and even snow-blindness, when exposed to several hours of ""snow light"". The United States Army has now determined that glare from snow does not cause snow-blindness in troops in a snow-covered country. Rather, a man's eyes frequently find nothing to focus on in a broad expanse of barren snow-covered terrain . So his gaze continually shifts and jumps back and forth over the entire landscape in search of something to look at. Finding nothing, hour after hour, the eyes never stop searching and the eyeballs become sore and the eye muscles ache. Nature eases this irritation by producing more fluid which covers the eyeball. The fluid covers the eyeball in increasing quantity until vision blurs , then is obscured , and the result is total, even though temporary, snow-blindness. Experiments led the Army to a simple method of overcoming this problem. Scouts ahead of a main body of troops are trained to shake snow from evergreen bushes, creating a dotted line as they cross completely snow-covered landscape. Even the scouts themselves throw lightweight, dark colored objects ahead on which they too can focus. The men following can then see something. Their gaze is arrested. Their eyes focus on a bush and having found something to see, stop scouring the snow-blanketed landscape. By focusing their attention on one object at a time, the men can cross the snow without becoming hopelessly snow-blind or lost. In this way the problem of crossing a solid white terrain is overcome. </s>"	balance the pain </s>
Question: Which of the following is WRONG according to the passage? Context: Dream culture is an important part of ancient Chinese culture. Dream interpreting is popular in China, and the most famous reference for dream interpreting is the book of Duke of Zhou Interprets Dreams.

If someone dreamt that he or she was roasted by a big fire, it shows he or she might easily get angry or nervous. * Dreams are usually different from the facts.

Kids knew not to go into his yard to pick a delicious apple, even off the ground, because old Dawson, they said, would come after you with his ball bullet gun. One Friday, 12-year-old Janet was going to stay all night with her friend Amy. They had to walk by Dawson's house on the way to Amy's house, but as they got close Janet saw him sitting on his front porch and suggested they cross over to the other side of the street. Like most of the children, she was scared of the old man because of the stories she'd heard about him. Amy said not to worry, Mr. Dawson wouldn't hurt anyone. When they got close enough, Dawson looked up with his usual frown, but when he saw it was Amy, a broad smile changed his entire face as he said, ""Hello Miss Amy. I see you've got a little friend with you today."" Amy smiled back and told him Janet was staying overnight and they were going to listen to music and play games. Dawson told them that sounded fun, and offered them each a fresh picked apple off his tree. When they got out of Dawson on earshot, Janet asked Amy, ""Everyone says he's the meanest man in town. How come was he so nice to us?"" Amy explained that when she first started walking past his house he wasn't very friendly and she was afraid of him, but she pretended he was wearing an invisible smile and so she always smiled back at him. It took a while, but one day he half-smiled back at her. After some more time, he started smiling real smiles and then started talking to her. ""An invisible smile?"" questioned Janet. ""Yes,"" answered Amy, ""my grandma told me that if I pretended I wasn't afraid and pretended he was smiling an invisible smile at me and I smiled back at him, that sooner or later he would really smile. Grandma says smiles are contagious."" However, it's so easy to get caught up in everyday life that we forget how simple it can be to bring cheer to ourselves and others.

We were looking for a waterfall .We didn't have much time to get to the waterfall and back, so we were running. We were wearing flip-flops to prevent our shoes getting dirty. It was raining, but lightly. It kept us cool as we climbed over giant stones and through a shallow stream. We followed red arrows and crossed that stream several times, walking on toward the promised waterfall. Time was not on our side, however, and we were forced to turn around. As we started back, we looked at the shallow stream we had just crossed. Where did this rushing river come from? That was when we realized a flash flood was around! In the few minutes the water rose at a fast speed. Now there were no big stones to be seen-only what looked like lumps covered with rushing water. We had no choice but to move our way back carefully in the rushing water -in flip-flops. We had crossed the stream not once or twice, but six times in search of a waterfall that we never even reached! With most of the crossings, we needed each other's help if we didn't want to be washed away by water. Wet all over, we felt relaxed after we made the last crossing. ""My dad always told me to keep off a river when travelling in the rain."" Josh said as we hurried back down the path. ""Why didn't you tell us that earlier?"" I laughed.

Tom McClean, an SAS soldier who holds the solo record for occupying Rockall for 40 days in 1985, told Hancock that being alone for two months was the greatest challenge Hancock would have to face. ""I'm fully expecting it to be tough,"" Nick Hancock said. ""I'm hoping that by doing my daily tasks fairly slowly, I'm going to be able to keep most of my time busy. I think the worst times will come if I'm boxed up for several days by bad weather."" Hancock hopes to land on Rockall in early June and will carry out the last tests of his boat next week. He has a small wind turbine and a solar panel for power, more than two months' food, a satellite phone and a laptop loaded with e-books to keep him going. Hancock will update an adventure blog, texting messages out on Twitter and emailing his wife Pam and friends every day. Rockall has been occupied before, most famously by McClean but also by three Greenpeace campaigners, who set the long-stay record of 42 days in 1997 by occupying the rock in protest at oil and gas exploration in the area. The last human inhabitants Hancock knows of are a small group of Belgian amateur radio enthusiasts, who are interested in broadcasting from distant islands; they were on Rockall overnight in late 2010.

Question: What can we learn from the story? Context: There was a huge battle between the warriors of Greece and the people of Troy. Prince Paris from Troy had stolen away the Greek queen; Helen. The Greek warriors set sail for Troy to fight for their queen. The battle outside Troy lasted for ten years. The men were fed up and wanted to return to their homes. Athene, goddess of war gave Ulysses the idea for a plan to end the war. They built a big wooden horse which they put in the middle of their encampment . Next they pretended to give up their camp. In reality many soldiers hid inside the wooden horse. Once they thought the camp had been abandoned the Trojans went out to check. They needed to know if the war was really over. They walked through the abandoned encampment and eventually found the wooden horse. They could not decide what it was. Some wanted to take it into the city, others thought that it was a gift to Zeus and feared touching or moving it in case they upset Zeus. Some Trojans decided to take it back into the city. They called a large group of troops, attached ropes and pulled it into the city. A huge celebration started. The city was free from war for the first time in nine years. Everybody feasted, drank and danced until eventually the merriment was over and they all went to sleep. This was the moment that the wooden horse opened a big flap hidden underneath. Out crept Ulysses and all of his men. They killed the sleeping troops, rescued Queen Helen, met up with the rest of their army and set sail for home. The story of the return journey is told in The Odyssey, a collection of poems piecing together the bits of the story from the many different places where the story took place. </s>	Keep a clear brain or you'll be cheated by something pretending </s>
"Question: Which of the following seems to be a threat to Hollywood? Context: Where in the world can you take an hour's train ride, and pass a forest, a London street, a scene from the Wild West, and a burning building that never burns down? There's only one place, and that's Hollywood, in California. The scenes you see from the tourist train are film sets in the Universal Studios, one of the oldest and largest movie companies in the USA. A visit to Universal Studios brings back memories of great days of Hollywood, the films and the stars. But they are only memories. Hollywood isn't quite the same as it used to be. Costs have gone up and confidence has gone down. Movie-makers are afraid to spend their money on expensive new ideas. Instead, they repeat old ones. The film industry is changing fast. Teenagers still go out to the movies. The theatre is a good place to meet friends away from home. But older people mostly stay home to watch series, like Dynasty have become as important to Hollywood as expensive movies. These ""soap opera"", as they are called, show rich, powerful families living in beautiful homes and wearing beautiful clothes. But the actors and actresses are nearly all middle-aged, like many of the people who watch them. Though it is soap operas that are keeping the film-makers of Hollywood in Business, big films are still being made in America. But more and more of them are made outside Hollywood. New York is the most important new center, but there are many others as well. Movie-makers have realized that they don't need Hollywood any more. Modern cameras and real houses instead of expensively made copies in a studio. Other states, especially Florida and Texas, are working hard to take the film business away from California.

"Question: What's the best title of the passage? Context: Zhang Ming, a college student from Shandong, created a 9-page ""WeChat guide"". With drawings and simple words, the step-by-step guide explains how to send messages, take pictures and make video calls. Zhang made the guide for his parents. ""My parents are getting old. They need an easy way to learn how to use new technology."" He said. Zhang's experience is common nowadays. Worldwide, 40 percent of parents learn about new technologies, including computers, mobile Internet and social media, from their children, according to a study from the International Communication Association in 2014. Parents used to teach their kids about almost everything. Now for the first time, the teachers become the students, and the students turn into the teachers. The change of roles comes from the rapid development of society and technology, says Zhou Xiaohong, a sociology professor from Nanjing University. Zhou said the Internet and other forms of media give children ways to get information besides from asking older generations . Therefore, in the age of information, it's possible that children know more than their parents do. According to the China Internet Network Information Center(CINIC), 56.7 percent of Internet users and 67.2 percent of social media users in China are under the age of 30. The younger generation usually acts as a _ between their family and the new environment. But when they teach their parents new technologies, parents can connect to the new world by themselves, noted Zhou. In Zhang Ming's eyes, teaching his parents about WeChat brings him closer to his parents. ""People can communicate more by using new technology.

His question reminded me of something I'd read somewhere before: ""Every morning when you get up, you have a choice about how you want to approach life that day,"" I said to the young man. ""I choose to be cheerful."" ""Let me give you an example,"" I continued. ""In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson.

Question: .Terry Semel was the CEO of _ . Context: Mark Zukerberg is the founder and CEO of Facebook, an extremely popular social working website that started in the United States. Now, millions of student users visit Facebook daily and the website is one of the top ten widely visited sites on the Internet worldwide. College and high school students use Facebook to communicate with friends and share both information and pictures for free. The company earns money through advertising. Many other companies have been rumored to be interested in buying Facebook. Just a few years after Mark started the company, he was approached by Terry Semel, who was the CEO of Yahoo. Terry offered Mark one billion dollars($1,000,000,000) to sell Facebook to Yahoo. Mark said no, though. He stands behind his dreams at the very beginning. He knows the value of the company could fall down; however, he is in this to build something unbelievable, not be bought out by another company. Maybe he was smart. Now Facebook is rumored to be worth billions of dollars and bigger companies like Microsoft or Google want a share of the company. Some private firms are also interested.

"Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Context: Maurice Sendak's children's book, Where the Wild Things Are, published in 1963, has become very successful throughout the years and was made into a movie earlier this year. The book's main character is a boy named Max who gets into trouble with his mother and is sent to bed without any supper. Before long, Max's room magically becomes a forest, and he sails away to a land where monsters(,) live. Max isn't scared, though, and becomes king of the wild things, but after a while, he begins feeling homesick. Max sails back home and his supper is still hot when he arrives in his bedroom. Many teachers and professors like this story and use it to help children develop creativity and imagination. Melina Davis, an education professor, said she likes how the book contains a couple of pages that have only pictures on them. ""This allows children to shape the story themselves,"" she said. The book contains a few of larger words that some parents worry may confuse children, but experts say those words help improve children's reading skills and challenge them. Davis said the book is well written which helps kids get involved in the story. ""The book talks about what all children go through, like 'I was naughty but my mommy still loves me',"" Davis said. The book also encourages children to face their fears. ""I think it's really good to show that Max makes friends with the monsters,"" Davis said. ""Kids can find out monsters aren't always the thing under the bed that's going to scare them. I think this is good because it shows that the children can go to scary places but still have a positive experience."" Since the book has been successful throughout the years, a movie was recently made and many people are excited to see it.

Question: Quicksand is _ . Context: A person steps on what seems like solid ground but discovers with horror that the ground is giving way underfoot. The person struggles desperately but is trapped. There is no escape. Slowly the person sinks deeper and at last is gone. The solid ground was solid only in appearance. It was actually quicksand, which is a deep mass of fine sand mixed with water. How is quicksand formed? Water pushes up from below the surface and is held by the sand. The grains of sand are forced apart by the water. They cannot hold any weight. The subsurface water may have come from a spring, a river, or a stream. Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand. Is it true that a person who steps into quicksand is doomed to die? No, for people have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become. Quick movements will make the sand yield for a time, but then it rushes back and settles solidly around the body. People trapped in quicksand should either lie back with arms outstretched, or not move at all. When the weight of the sand around his body has displaced equals that person's weight, the victim will stop sinking. With feet held still, and with slow movements of the arms, as in the backstroke in swimming, people have managed to roll to safety and reach firm ground. </s>	a mass of fine sand mixed with water </s>
"Question: According to Harry Patrinos, the key to successful school systems is _ . Context: The World Bank has looked at the distinguishing features of successful school system. According to the World Bank's education specialist, Harry Patrinos, this include: improving the quality of teachers and making sure that teachers are highly regarded; providing information to make schools accountable and giving autonomy to schools and head teachers. This matters not only for individual pupils but also for the well-being of countries, he says, because improving educational performance has a direct impact on improving economic performance. China's education performance-- at least in cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong-- seems to be as spectacular as the country's fast growing economy. Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities consider education to be important and are willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year. ""Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,"" says Prof Cheng. Under the banner ""First class city, first class education"", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classroom, upgrading schools and improving the curriculum in the last decade. It got rid of the ""key schools"" system which concentrated resources only on top students and top schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China. Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s.Its survival as a service and management hub depends on upgrading knowledge and skills. In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on closing the gap for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants. The report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world. </s>"	to improve teachers' abilities and give schools free performance right </s>

"Question: According to the passage, what's the attitude of Mr. Liu towards divorce? Context: Soaring divorce rates around the globe are the environment, American researchers suggested in a study released on a Monday. Michigan State University researcher Jianguo ""Jack"" Liu and his assistant Eunice Yu said the increasing number of divorces leads to more households with fewer people and greater consumption of water and energy. They said housing units require space, construction materials and fuel to heat and cool, regardless of the number of inhabitants. For example, in the United States in 2005, divorced households consumed an extra 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 627 billion gallons of water. An additional 38 million extra rooms required heating and lighting that same year due to divorced households. That costs $6.9 billion in extra utility costs per year, Liu said, plus an added $ 3.6 billion for water, in addition to other costs such as land use. ""A married household actually uses resources more efficiently than a divorced household,"" Liu said. He said that in cohabitating household, people will watch the same television, share the air conditioning and heat and use the same refrigerator. All things use energy at a regularly stable rate, regardless of the number of users. Liu said he was not condemning divorce, ""Some people really need to get divorced."" He said cohabitation--whether by a family or friends--was simply a more environmentally friendly option. Additonally, the researchers noted that trends other than divorce are also changing family living structures, such as the end of multiple generations of a family sharing a home and people remaining single longer. ""People's first reaction to this research is surprise, and then it seems simple."" Liu said in a press release. ""But a lot of things become simple after research is done. Our challenges were to connect the dots and quantify their relationships. People have been talking about how to protect the environment and fight against climate change, but divorce is a factor that people don't notice and it needs to be considered"". He said the increasing energy demands caused by divorce should be considered by governments when they are creating environmental policies.

Question: It is implied that _ . Context: Most employers say that they wish to employ the right person for the right job. A recent report by Britain's Independent Institute of Manpower Studies, however, disagrees with this. The report states that most employers wish to avoid employing the wrong person. Rather than looking for the right person, they are looking for applicants to turn down. The report also suggests that in Britain and in many other parts of the world the selection methods used to pick out the right person for the job certainly do not match up to those used to judge a piece of new equipment. Employers used three main selection methods: interviewing, checking resume or application forms and examining references. Most of the employers asked in this survey stated that these selection methods were used more for weeding out unsuitable applicants rather than for finding suitable ones. Interviews were considered to be more reliable than either resume checks or references from past employers. Research, however, proves otherwise. Interviewers' decisions are often strongly influenced by their earlier judgment of the written application. Also different employers view facts differently. One may consider applicants who have frequently changed jobs as people with broad and useful experience. Another will see such applicants as unreliable and unlikely to stay for long in the new job. Some employers place great importance on academic qualifications whereas the link between this and success in management is not necessarily strong. Some employers use handwriting as a standard. The report states that there is little evidence to support the value of the letter for judging working ability. References, also, are sometimes unreliable as they are not very important while checks on credit and security records and applicants' political opinions are often the opposite. The report is more favorable towards trainability tests and those which test personality and personal and mental skills. The report concludes by suggesting that interviewing could become more reliable if the questions were arranged in a careful, organized system and focused on the needs of the employing organization. </s>	criteria will be set up according to the real situation of the applicants </s>

"Question: Most people think that Bill Gates is _ . Context: As a teenager in 1972, Bill Gates boasted that he would be a millionaire by the time he was 20. While he did not quite achieve that goal, only 15 years later, he was a millionaire. And by 1992, as head of the Microsoft company, he became the richest man in America with assets of nearly US $ 6.3 billion. Born in Seattle, Washington on 28, October, 1956, Gates was named William Henry after his father and grandfather. From the beginning, he was an extremely energetic and intelligent child. He had read the entire world book encyclopedia by the age of nine. His favorite subjects at school were science and math and his favorite pastime was ""thinking"". Gates first started to play with computers at the age of 13. Before long he became an expert at working the school's computer. After his graduation from secondary school, Gates was accepted by the three top universities in the USA-Princeton, Harvard and Yale. He chose Harvard and began classes there the next autunm, majoring maths. But he was still obsessed with computers and spent as much time in the computer laboratories as he did in the lecture halls. By 1975, Gates and a partner, Paul Allen, had developed a software program called BASIC. This was not the first program ever created, but its inventors were the first to decide that people who wanted to use it should pay for it. BASIC was a success because until it came along, there had been no efficient way of getting computers to carry out instructions. Although he had not completed his degree, Gates left university and went to work full time for the new company he had formed called Microsoft. His next project was the software program that made him famous and very rich. It was called DOS, short for Disk Operating System, and it was purchased by IBM in 1980. Today it is the operating system used in more than 14 million personal computers around the world. As chief executive officer of Microsoft, Gates is known as a bright man, but one who is not easily satisfied. He is quick to criticize his staff and hates to be questioned about decisions he has made. He was regarded as a loner and unfashionable boring computer nut until his marriage to Microsoft manager Melinda French on New Year's Day 1994. Yet to many people now, Gates, is a person who is, in spite of his great wealth, humble and ordinary. He spends his money carefully. He eats in fast food restaurants and flies economy class. And when praised for Microsoft's great success, he has been heard to say, ""All we do is put software in a box and if people see it in the stores and like it, they buy it."" </s>"	a quite common, normal person </s>

"Question: It is _ for David Blaine to eat food after such a long starvation. Context: American magician David Blaine left the glass box in which he had lived for 44 days without food on October 19, 2003. Hundreds of people came to watch the end of his starvation experiment, which has become one of London's main tourist attractions. Looking thinner and darker, 30-year-old Blaine was taken out of his box over the River Thames and immediately went to hospital. He was then slowly reintroduced to food, a process doctors say could be life threatening. He had been drinking only water since September 5. A native of Brooklyn, New York, Blaine first became known as a street magician in the early 1990s. He soon found himself doing magic tricks in bars for the likes of American actor Leonardo DiCaprio and his super model friends. Over the last decade Blaine has become famous with a combination of breathtaking magic and clever tricks aimed at getting a lot of attention. In 1999, he was buried in a coffin for one week and, in 2000, he spent 62 hours in a giant block of ice. Last year he stood on top of a 25-meter pillar in the center of New York for 35 hours before jumping into a pile of boxes. ""I think a lot of people are unable to accept that they're able to do what they can do,"" he said. ""They don't realize we can survive. The human being is an amazing creation."" But he seems to have suffered from spending so long in the glass box. He said that at times he was unable to see, had serious back pains and lost his sense of taste. </s>"	dangerous </s>
Question: Which is the right behavior when swimming at the beach? Context: Lakes, ponds, and beaches mean summer fun and cool relaxation from hot weather. But water also can be dangerous for kids if you don't take great care. Nearly 1,000 kids die each year by drowning. Here are some tips to keep your kids safe in the water: At the Lake or Pond *Don't let little kids swim alone without adult supervision-- lakes or ponds may be shallow near the bank and are suddenly deep sharply further out from shore. *Ponds and lakes may hide jagged rocks, broken glass, or rubbish. *Make sure kids wear foot protection; even in the water, they should wear socks or water shoes. *Watch out for weeds and grass in the water that could trap a leg or arm. *Most boating accidents, particularly among teenagers, are related to alcohol . Be sure teens know about the dangers of alcohol, on and off the water. At the Beach *Teach kids to always swim when and where a lifeguard is on duty. Unlike the calm waters of a swimming pool, the beach has special dangers like currents and tides . Check with the lifeguard when you arrive to find out about the water conditions. *Tell kids never to stand with their back to the water because a sudden wave can easily knock a child over. *Teach kids that if they're caught in a dangerous wave, they should swim parallel to the shore or should tread water and call for a lifeguard's help. Whether at the lake or at the beach, teach your child to get out of the water during bad weather, especially lightning. </s>	Call for help if caught in a dangerous wave </s>

"Question: What can we learn from what Gemma Cloke said? Context: More than 27,000 people from around the UK set off at dawn from London to begin the cycle route through Surrey to the Sussex coast. The annual 54-mile ride raises money for the British Heart Foundation(BHF) and is Europe's largest charity cycling event. Cyclists began the exhausting journey at Clapham Common at 6 a. m. , hoping to reach Brighton seafront within an average of six hours. Money from today's event will help the charity to continue its vital work through heart research and the development of its care and support services. Among those taking part was BBC Breakfast's resident Dr Rosemary Leonard and several colleagues. BHF spokeswoman Gemma Cloke said, ""It was quite cold this morning, but everyone set off without any problems."" Those taking part range in age from 14 to those in their 70s. Last year cyclists raisedPS4. 1 million for the charity, and have raised more thanPS50 million since the BHF became involved in the event in 1980. The first ride was held in 1976. It is hoped this year's fund raising total could reachPS4. 5 million. She added : ""We have a lot of people taking part, from the more experienced cyclists to those cycling with friends and family in memory of someone and to raise money through sponsorship.""

"Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE? Context: Xu Shu was much valued by Liu Bei for his strategic talents. After several victories on the battleground against Cao Cao, Xu was made the chief military advisor. Cao Cao was greatly surprised at the news. ""If you want this person,"" one of his advisors said, ""you can bring his mother to Xuchang and send a forged letter in his mother's handwriting, asking Xu Shu to desert Liu Bei and come here. As Xu is well-known for a strong filial affection, surely he will come."" This plot worked. For Xu, on receiving the letter, cried tearfully, asking Liu Bei for an immediate departure. Feeling sad, though, Liu persisted in his stay for another night, during which the two aired their sad feelings. The next day Liu laid a banquet outside the city for Xu. Holding the latter's hand, Liu said, ""After we separate today, only heaven knows when and where we will meet again."" He wept bitter tears. After setting off on his way, Xu suddenly turned his horse and returned. ""I almost forgot an important matter."" He said to Liu. ""Ten kilometers from Xiangyang City, in a place called Long zhong, there is a talent called Zhuge Liang. Do you want to meet him?"" Liu expressed his willingness at once, but also aired doubt about whether Zhuge Liang was as talented as Xu. ""He tells positions of stars in the heavens,"" Xu assured him, ""and recognizes everything on earth. He knows a person's real nature at the first meeting----the number one talent under the heaven. If you have him as your military advisor, you'll have the country under your name."" Liu suggested a visit to Zhuge by Xu on his behalf. At this, the latter shook his head in disapproval. ""You must go and offer your invitation personally, and his acceptance depends entirely on your sincerity."" With these words said, Xu turned his horse and left.

Question: From the passage we know that _ . Context: Most people think talking is the most important communication skill.They care little about listening.A research about our waking day communicating time shows that 9% is spent writing, 16% reading, 30% talking and 45% listening. Many of us can remember only 50% immediately after hearing something.But within two to eight weeks, we can only remember 25% or less of the message.Sometimes it will make us fail if we really forget something important. Here are some suggestions to be a good listener. Stop talking -- you can't listen well when you speak. Ask questions -- when you don't understand, when you want to catch their attention or when you want to be liked. Be polite -- give them time to say what they have to say. Listen carefully and actively to what they are saying -- pay attention to their words, their ideas and their feelings as those things relate to the subjects. Understand the main points. Look at each other -- you will feel confident by looking. Don't argue with other people when you are trying to understand them, especially when they are speaking. Try not to bring your worries and problems -- when you listen, they will stop you from listening well. Learn to listen and you'll achieve a great success in your life. </s>	you'd better leave your worries and problems behind when you listen </s>
"Question: According to the author, people who are lacking in personal freedom should read _ . Context: The following are four books that will help you change your mind and change your life. 1) You Can Heal Your Life, Louise Hay:A groundbreaking book when it was released in 1982.It is still the book that I turn to when I have physical unrest that requires deeper understanding.Louise Hay is the pioneer in looking at the connection between the physical unrest that we have in our body and the emotional connection.At the time that she wrote the book many people scoffed at this idea,but it is now widely accepted and millions of people refer to it on a daily basis. 2) The Four Agreements,Don Miguel Ruiz:Maintaining a sense of reliability and faith is developed through understanding according to The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz written in 1997.We are faced with rules and regulations:don't do this,don't do that,watch what you are doing,be kind,loyal,faithful, etc.The four agreements represent a simple system of maintaining your own inner authority while practicing being a true person with other people. 3) Slowing Down to the Speed of Life,Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey:This is a new one in my ""bedside collection"" and one that has made the biggest impact on me 1ately.Written in 1997, it is even more relevant today than it was when it was written.The idea of ""slowing down'' to get there faster was extremely hard for me to understand.As a human species we seem to enjoy moving fast and expecting quick results,especially from ourselves,I should be successful now in contrast to ''in the fullness of time"" when I am ready. 4) The Game of Life and How to Play it,Florence Scovel-Shinn:A classic book that was first published in 1925 and remains one of my favorite books of all time.Scovel-Shinn understood the power of our words to express either our deepest desires or our most horrible nightmares.

"Question: Which of the following is true about Westlake College? Context: Laptop computers are popular all over the world. People use them on trains and airplanes, in airports and hotels. These laptops connect people to their workplace. In the United States today, laptops also connect students to their classrooms. Westlake College in Virginia will start a laptop computer program that allows students to do schoolwork anywhere they want. Within five years, each of the 1500 students at the college will receive a laptop. The laptops are part of a $10 million computer program at Westlake, a 110-year-old college. The students with laptops will also have access to the Internet. In addition, they will be able to use e-mail to ""speak"" with their teachers, their classmates, and their families.

"Question: What is the purpose of the passage? Context: Elephants scored a big win in 2010. Representatives from 175 countries at the United Nations' Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Doha, Qatar, rejected a bid to allow the sale of ivory. Two African nations, Tanzania and Zambia, had asked to open the ivory trade. Conservationists feared that weakening a 21-year-old ban on the sale of ivory would have encouraged illegal hunting and hurt elephant populations. African elephants once numbered in the millions. Today, there are fewer than 500,000. ""People born in 100 years should be able to see an elephant, "" said Noah Wekesa, Kenya's minister of forestry and wildlife. His country voted to keep the ban. In the 1980s, as many as one million elephants were killed throughout Africa. Hunters killed the animals for their ivory tusks, which were used to make jewelry and other items. "" The slaughter of elephants in Africa was just terrible, "" says Paul Todd of the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( IFAW ). The group works to protect animals. The ivory wars continued until 1989, when CITES voted to ban all trade in ivory. With trade controlled, demand for ivory fell. Elephant populations began to increase slowly. Tanzania and Zambia asked CITES to allow ivory sales from government stockpiles . Ivory is so expensive that it's known as ""white gold"". Tanzania holds almost 200,000 pounds of ivory, which is worth as much as $20 million. Zambia has 48,000 pounds of the ""white gold"". The two countries argued that their ivory had been taken from hunters or had come from animals that died naturally. They said this income from the sale of ivory would help the countries. Wildlife experts, who believe that the ivory trade encourages illegal hunting, cheered the CITES decision. ""It's a rare victory for elephants,"" said Jason Bell-Leask, the IFAW's director for southern Africa. </s>"	To report the news of the banning of ivory trade. </s>

"Question: Which of the following is not the function of Pantry APP? Context: The world produces about 4 billion metric tons of food a year but 1.2 to 2 billion tons is not eaten, the study by the London-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers said. It is instead thrown away. Experts say food is wasted in both rich and poor countries, but for different reasons. Elliot Woolley teaches sustainable manufacturing at Loughborough University in Britain. He spoke at the Global Conference on Sustainable Manufacturing, which was held earlier this month in Vietnam. Mr. Woolley said in poor countries, food is usually lost while it is still in the field or during storage and transportation. He said that is because food producers there are inefficient. These businesses are unable to operate effectively without wasting materials, time or energy. But he added that once food is sold in developing countries, people usually eat everything they buy. However, people in developed countries throw away as much as half of the food they purchase. In the US, big contributors to waste include supersized portions that customers simply can't manage, and""eat as much as you want""offers in restaurants. In the UK, over-conservative sell-by dates on labels and two-for-one offers of perishable items are key factors, encouraging consumers to buy too much food to start with and to throw away items that have reached their sell-by date, but which are still edible. And efficient farming methods, transport and storage mean that most of the wastage occurs through retail and customer behavior. The British researcher called this custom""adisgrace"". Elliot Woolley has created a smartphone app that he says shows users what food they have bought and when the food is about to become unsafe to eat. It also gives information on how people can combine the foods they have to make a meal. The software program is called""Pantry App"". Mr. Woolley said that people who used the app reduced the amount of food they wasted by a third. But this result came from a limited experiment -- users only followed their food use for a week. Jeremy Bonvoisin is a student at the Technical University of Berlin. He attended the recent conference in Vietnam. He said one way to solve the problem of wasting food is to take steps to persuade people to stop buying so much food in the first place. He said people buy more food than they need because it is becoming less costly. They waste so much food because they buy more than they need. He said the new app could help those who already want to change the way they use the food they buy. But he is also worried that it could get people to waste more food because they no longer have to pay attention to how much they have bought. </s>"	It tells people how much food they have wasted. </s>
"Question: Where is this passage most probably from? Context: Sunday, 31 August We've been in China for a month now. Dad, Mom, Harry and I moved to Tianjin on 25 August. We're not very far from Beijing. Two days ago, we celebrated my 16thbirthday. It was great celebrating in China; the only thing that was strange was the cake--here they're not as sweet as the ones in New York. On Monday school starts--I wonder what it will be like. Monday, 1 September On my first day I was looking around for a locker to put my books in. However, here all the students keep all of their books at their desks--we stay in the same classroom because apparently we don't have to go from class to class--teachers come to us! Today we selected teacher assistants for each subject. Their duties are to collect homework, make announcements, and do other stuff for the teacher and the students. It's kind of a big deal here! Since I am from the US, I was asked to be the English assistant. I felt so proud but quite nervous at the same time because I wasn't sure what I had to do, but I accepted the job anyway. Friday, 3 October Boy, what a week! Now we have nine classes every day, including the morning class, a combination of our American schools' ""Homeroom"" and ""Study Hall"". I think Chinese students work too much! I have to do my homework when I get back home. I don't even have time to watch TV or surf the Internet like before.

"Question: The main idea of the passage is that _ . Context: It is not only praise or punishment that determines a child's level of confidence. There are some other important ways we shape our kids--particularly by giving instructions and commands in a negative or positive choice of words. For example, we can say to a child ""Don't run into traffic!"" or ""Stay on the footpath close to me."" In using the latter, you will be helping your kids to think and act positively, and to feel competent in a wide range of situations, because they know what to do, and aren't scaring themselves about what not to do. Why does such a small thing make a difference? It is all in the way the human mind works. What we think, we automatically rehearse. For example, if someone offered you a million dollars not to think of a blue monkey for two minutes, you wouldn't be able to do it. When a child is told ""Don't fall off the tree,"" he will think of two things: ""don't"" and ""fall off the tree"". That is, he will automatically create the picture of falling off the tree in his mind. A child who is vividly imagining falling off the tree is much more likely to fall off. So it is far better to use ""Hold on to the tree carefully."" Clear, positive instructions help kids to understand the right way to do things. Kids do not always know how to be safe, or how to react to the warning of the danger in negative words. So parents should make their commands positive. ""Sam, hold on firm to the side of the boat"" is much more useful than ""Don't you dare to fall out of the boat?"" or worse still ""How do you think I'll feel if you drown?"" The changes are small but difference is obvious. Children learn how to guide and organize themselves from the way we guide them with our words, so it pays to be positive. </s>"	choice of words can make a difference </s>

That, at least, is the opinion of a new book written by a group of Chinese authors. China Is Not Happy was published in March, 2009.It is a follow-up to the 1996 work China Can Say No, a bestseller that complained about the influence of the West, and the US in particular, on China.Thirteen years later, the authors of China Is Not Happy list their dissatisfaction with how China is being treated in the world today.They argue that China needs to use its growing power and economic resources to build its own position. ""From looking at the history of human civilization, we are most qualified to lead this world."" the book says. The authors, single out the US for special scorn , and say their book's message has been helped by the economic crisis ,"" This economic problem has shown the Chinese people that America does have problems, that what we've been saying is right."" said Wang Xiaodong, one of the aulhors in an interview with The Wall Street. Since being released on March 13, the book has become a bestseller in many Chinese bookstores.The publisher has printed 270,000 copies, and says sales are far better than expected. Yet much of the response to the book has been negative.Several reviews in the Chinese media have criticized the book's radical opinions. The book is a way to ""fish money from the pockets of the angry youth and angry elderly,"" wrote one critic in the China Youth Daily.Meanwhile, a well-known sociologists Li Yinhe, has said that China needs patriotism , but there is a limit. Wang Xiaodong admitted in an interview that the book's title is a bit of a trick.""

""Mr. Bear,"" the Princess said, ""you are welcome in Nahloo. Here we share with each other. We don't take things from each other."" Broo thought about it for a moment and realized that he had made a mistake. ""Well,"" he said, ""maybe drinking all that milk wasn't the best idea."" The Princess continued, ""Mr. Bear, you can drink and eat, but you won't feel good because you have never made any contribution to anyone else. I think you'll find that it is better to be full in your heart, not just in your stomach."" After saying this, the Princess went back to the castle, leaving Broo alone. One day, Broo was going to take lots of cookies from the rabbits, then he remembered what the Princess said to him. So Broo decided not to eat the cookies.

Question: What happened when the author bought anything with her accumulated money? Context: My parents have always raised me to be very money-conscious, so I guess, in that sense, they are rather untraditional. Since I was a little girl, if I ever wanted to purchase anything, my parents would sternly remind me of the value of every cent, prompting me to spend my pocket money only when necessary. My mom actually came up with a system that we strictly abide by in regards to money-spending. She gives me a certain amount of allowance every month, and whenever I buy anything with my accumulated money, I keep track of my receipts and record it in a little notebook, essentially a tiny version of my mom's own accounting booklet. Being in control of my own money has really taught me to be careful in how I spend my money, giving me a sense of responsibility and ownership over it. As for earning money, aside from my allowance, my parents never really encouraged me to go out and find a job at typical American occupation locales , such as restaurants or clothing stores. Instead, they would prefer that I spend my time focusing on my schoolwork, which I guess is where my parents become more traditional. Yet I still earn money here and there in little jobs, such as teaching students at my school, and of course, writing for the paper. Though I have several friends already working, I am pretty happy with my current situation. I am able to focus on my studies, all the while earning quite a bit of money, and also learning monetary skills that are _ to survival in the real world, and for that I am grateful. </s>	She kept track of her receipts and recorded it in a little notebook. </s>
"Question: What is the main topic of the passage? Context: Alice Walker makes her living by writing. And her poems, short stories, and novels have won many prizes for her. She was born in Eatonton, Georgia. She went to public schools there, and then to Spelman College in Atlanta before coming to New York to attend Sarah Lawrence College, from which she graduated in 1966. For a time she lived in Jackson, Mississippi, with her lawyer husband and small daughter. About Langston Hughes, American Poet, her first book for children, she says, ""After my first meeting with Langston Hughes, I promised I would write a book for children someday. Why? Because I, at twenty-two, knew next to nothing of his work, and he didn't scold me; he just gave me a pile of his books. And he was kind to me; I will always be thankful that in his warmth he fulfilled my deepest dream (and need) of what a poet should be."" ""To me he is not dead at all. Hardly a day goes by that I don't think of him or speak of him. Once, just before he died, when he was sick with the flu, I took him a basket full or oranges. The joy I felt in giving that simple gift is undiminished by time. He said he liked oranges, too. "" </s>"	Alice Walker's reflection (,) on Langston Hughes. </s>
"Question: The ""tree"" probably stands for _ . Context: I was puzzled! Why was this old woman making such a fuss about an old copse which was of no use to anybody? She had written letters to the local paper, even to a national, protesting about a projected by-pass to her village, and, looking at a map, the route was nowhere near where she lived and it wasn't as if the area was attractive. I was more than puzzled, I was curious. The enquiry into the route of the new by-pass to the village was due to take place shortly, and I wanted to know what it was that motivated her. So it was that I found myself knocking on a cottage door, being received by Mary Smith and then being taken for a walk to the woods. ""I've always loved this place,"" she said, ""it has a lot of memories for me, and for others. We all used it. They called it 'Lovers lane'. It's not much of a lane, and it doesn't go anywhere important, but that's why we all came here. To be away from people, to be by ourselves. "" she added. It was indeed pleasant that day and the songs of many birds could be heard. Squirrels watched from the branches, quite bold in their movements, obviously few people passed this way and they had nothing to fear. I could imagine the noise of vehicles passing through these peaceful woods when the by-pass was built, so _ but as I hold strong opinions about the needs of the community over-riding the opinions of private individuals, I said nothing. The village was quite a dangerous place because of the traffic especially for old people and children, their safety was more important to me than an old woman's strange ideas. ""Take this tree,"" she said pausing after a short while. ""To you it is just that, a tree. Not unlike many others here."" She gently touched the bark, ""Look here, under this branch, what can you see?"" ""It looks as if someone has done a bit of carving with a knife."" I said after a cursory inspection. ""Yes, that's what it is!"" she said softly. She went on, ""He had a penknife with a spike for getting stones from a horse's hoof, and I helped him to carve them. We were very much in love, but he was going away, and could not tell me what he was involved in the army. I had guessed of course. It was the last evening we ever spent together, because he went away the next day, back to his Unit."" Mary Smith was quiet for a while, then she sobbed. ""His mother showed me the telegram. 'Sergeant R Holmes ...Killed in action in the invasion of France.'..."" ""I had hoped that you and Robin would one day get married."" she said, ""He was my only child, and I would have loved to be a Granny, they would have been such lovely babies'- she was like that! "" ""Two years later she too was dead. 'Pneumonia , following a chill on the chest' was what the doctor said, but I think it was an old fashioned broken heart. A child would have helped both of us."" There was a further pause. Mary Smith gently caressed the wounded tree, just as she would have caressed him. ""And now they want to take our tree away from me."" Another quiet sob, then she turned to me. ""I was young and pretty then, I could have had anybody, I wasn't always the old woman you see here now. I had everything I wanted in life, a lovely man, health and a future to look forward to."" She paused again and looked around. The breeze gently moved through the leaves with a sighing sound. ""There were others, of course, but no one can match my Robin!"" she said strongly. ""And now I have nothing - except the memories this tree holds. If only I could get my hands on that awful man who writes in the paper about the value of the road they are going to build where we are standing now, I would tell him. Has he never loved, has he never lived, does he not know anything about memories? We were not the only ones, you know, I still meet some who came here as Robin and I did. Yes, I would tell him!""

Question: What do people not think about when they choose to have a second child? Context: It is most difficult for parents to decide whether to have a second child or not. It is often heard that a single child is like to be a lonely child. There are no other children in the family for the child to talk or play with. An only child is not able to get along well with children of his age. Some parents regretted making the decisions to have only one child. But the number of parents choosing to have only one child is increasing in many parts of the world. In the US, for example, more than14 percent of women between 18 and 34 plan to have just one child. The same can be seen in the UK. In Japan, the average number of children born per family had gone down to 1.42 by 1996. For some single-child parents, especially who are busy working every day, time and energy seem to be _ . They don't have enough time and energy to share with more children. For other people, money is their first consideration. Many couples in Japan choose not to have large families as the cost of supporting a child up to the age of 18 reaches around US$160,000. </s>	food </s>
"Question: What can we learn from the passage? Context: The high school diploma is losing its value quickly, as a growing number of students graduate from school without the math and reading skills that colleges and companies require, according to a new report. The high school graduation exams that most states require students to pass before they graduate remain far too easy. Most of the exams generally test eighth-or ninth-grade level work. Today, even high school graduates who are going to have blue-collar jobs need to study the math, research and writing courses. But in high school, only students who are going to college are now required to take these courses. ""If you want a good job with a good pay, it's a high-skill job,"" said Michael Cohen, a leading member of the America Diploma Project. The project suggests that all graduates master a wide range of skills. ""A high school diploma should mean something to a company and university,"" said Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, who is Achieve's co-chairman. In Taft's state, about 30% students who go directly to college from high school have to take _ of English or math, he said. It's easy to see that the present high-school graduating standards are not preparing students for college education. And with high-skilled jobs increasingly headed overseas to places like India and Ireland, states need to act, he said. To prove why math and reading skills matter, the report includes real-life examples of problems students meet in college and that workers must solve each day on the job. Some states are taking actions to upgrade the high school diploma. In Texas, all high school students, starting with the 2008 graduating class, will have to take the college-prep curriculum - unless a parent agrees to an easier course load. Other states are planning similar moves. The report includes examples of reading and math skills that high-school students should have. Project leaders say they hope parents will use those examples to judge the coursework at their kids' high schools. </s>"	It is easier for companies to find high-skilled workers in India. </s>
Question: How did the writer probably feel before meeting the disabled girl?

One day while I was working at the cash register in the gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a little girl in wheelchair. As I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she was seated on her chair. I then realized she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and the trunk of the human body. She was wearing a little white dress with the patterns of red roses and yellow dots. As the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink . As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me the most beautiful, largest smile I have ever seen All of a sudden her _ was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and almost instantly gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. I immediately felt full of hope and confidence. She took me, a poor, unhappy college student, into her world, a world of smiles, love and warmth. That was ten years ago, but I still remember it clearly as if it happened just yesterday.

"Question: For the writer, saying hello to others _ . Context: When I was about 10 one day, I was walking down the street with my mother. She stopped to speak to Mr. Lee. I knew I could see Mr. Lee anytime around the neighborhood, so I just stood there. After we passed him, my mother stopped and said something unforgettable, ""You let that be the last time you ever walk by somebody you know without opening your mouth to speak, because even a dog can wag its tail when it passes you on the street."" That sentence sounds simple but it made me become who I am. At work, I used to say hello to the president of the company and ask him how our business was doing. But I also spoke to the people in the cafe and people who cleaned the buildings, and asked them how their children were doing, for every single person deserves to be accepted, no matter how humble they are. I remember that after a few years of passing by the president, I had the courage to ask him for a chat. We had a great talk. At some point, when I asked him how far he thought I could go in his company, he said that if I wanted to, I could get all the way to his seat. I've become vice-president, but that hasn't changed how I treat people. I speak to people wherever I am. Speaking to people creates a pathway into their world, and it lets them come into mine, too.

Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Context: Over time, the custom of kissing developed as a way for adults to express their love and affection for one another. The roots of this form of affection can be traced back to primitive times, when mothers fondled their children, much as mothers do today. Much later, in the sixth century, society apparently accepted the custom of kissing between adults as an expression of their affection. Not surprisingly, France first accepted kissing in courtship . There, figure dancing was popular, and each dance was sealed with a kiss. The custom of kissing swept from France through Europe to Russia, where Russian nobility loved to imitate the French. Eventually, the kiss was incorporated into marriage ceremonies, and today lip locks couples into sweet matrimony. The custom of kissing today, as well as in ancient times, serves to pay _ to another. Early Romans kissed each other on the mouth or on the eyes to greet one another in a manner they thought to be dignified. One Roman emperor even ranked a person's importance by the body part he was allowed to kiss. He allowed important nobles to kiss his lips, less important ones to kiss his hands, and the least important ones to kiss his feet. In Russia, the highest sign of recognition from the Crown meant a kiss from the Tsar himself. Today, natives of many African tribes pay homage to their Chief by kissing the ground over which he has walked. </s>	Russian nobility followed the custom of kissing from the French. </s>
"Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Context: The German shepherd runs off and noses around in the grass of Kenya's Laikipia Plateau. ""OK, Oakley,"" the dog's handler orders, ""Find it!"" Oakley sniffs until he comes to a bush, then stops, sits, and looks up at his handler. She bends to see what he has found: the waste of an endangered African wild dog. ""Good dog!"" she praises. The handler pulls a tennis ball from her pocket. Oakley jumps for his reward. ""He doesn't actually want the waste,"" says Aimee Hurt, a founding member of the U.S.-based group Working Dogs for Conservation. Hurt is in Kenya to train both Oakley and his handler. ""He finds it so he can play with his ball. We're the ones who want the waste."" Detection dogs are sometimes taught to locate actual animals. Black-footed ferrets have been studied with their help. But more often the dogs learn to locate the waste of creatures such as bears, wolves and mountain lions. What the dogs find provides scientists with data about a species. Scientists can use the DNA collected from animal waste to identify individuals, sex, and population sizes -- all without ever seeing the animal itself. ""It can take years to gather this kind of information if you have to trap animals,"" Hurt explains. Waste analysis might make a huge difference when wild species are accused of attacking domestic livestock . Hurt says, ""A good detection dog will find the waste so we can see what the animal is actually eating.""

"Question: What kind of trouble came to Greenwich in 1649? Context: Greenwich is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning ""green village"". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Henry VIII lived there. He knew that England must be strong at sea. So he started two big ship-yards at Greenwich. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea: their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were. You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich Time. </s>"	A war started in England. </s>
Question: How does the eye-recognition program work? Context: Soon computers and other machines will be able to remember you by looking at your eyes! The program works because everyone's eyes are different. So in the future you won't have to remember a number when you want to use a machine or take money out of a bank. You'll just have to look at the machine and it will be able to tell who you are. The eye-recognition program is already being tested in shops and banks in the USA, Britain and France. Soon, this technology will change all other ways of finding out who people are. However, scientists are working on other systems. Machines will soon be able to know you from the shape of your face or hands or even your smell! We already have machines that can tell who you are from your voice or the mark made by your fingers. Eye-recognition is better than other kinds because your eyes don't change as you get older, or get dirty like hands or fingers. And even twins have different eyes, so the program can be up to 94% correct, depending on how good the technology is. Some programs may only be right 51% of the time. In Britain, it was found that 91% of people who had tried it said that they liked the idea of eye-recognition. In the future your computer will be looking at you in the eye.

"Question: When the writer saw the elephant he felt _ . Context: The orderly came back in a few minutes with a rifle and some Burmans. He told us that the elephant was in the rice fields below, only a few hundred yards away. As I started forward practically the whole population of the quarter flocked out of the houses and followed me. They had seen the rifle and were all shouting that I was going to shoot the elephant. It was fun to them, as it would be to an English crowd; besides, they wanted the meat. It made me a little uneasy. I had no intention of shooting the elephant--I had merely sent for the rifle to defend myself--and it is always uneasy to have a crowd following you. I marched down the hill, looking and feeling a fool, with the rifle over my shoulder and an ever-growing army of people knocking and pushing at my heels. Beyond the huts there was a rice field a thousand yards across, muddy from the first rains. The elephant was standing eight yards from the road. He took not the slightest notice of the crowd. He was tearing up bunches of grass, beating them against his knees to clean them and feeding them into his mouth. As soon as I saw the elephant I knew with perfect certainty that I ought not to shoot him. It is a serious matter to shoot a working elephant -- it is comparable to destroying a huge and costly piece of machinery. There, peacefully eating, the elephant looked no more dangerous than a cow. I thought then and I think now that his attack of ""must"" was already passing off, in which case he would merely wander harmlessly about. Moreover, I did not in the least want to shoot him. But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me. It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. I looked at the sea of the faces above the colorful clothes--faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a magician about to perform a trick. They did not like me. But with the magical rifle in my hands I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I should have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward. And it was at this moment that I first felt the hollowness, the uselessness of the white man's control in the East. Here was I, standing in front of the unarmed crowd--seemingly the leading actor; but in reality only a puppet . I understood in this moment that when the white man turns ruler of complete power it is his own freedom that he destroys. </s>"	pitiful </s>
"Question: 37. According to Mr. Bjomson, _ . Context: In June, 2007, a group of students from eight high schools in Winnipeg, the capital of Canada's Manitoba province, will begin test-launching a satellite the size of a Rubik's cube. The one-kilogram Win-Cub satellite, named for its home city and its shape, will be put into low orbit. Once in space, it can perform for a few months or up to several years, communicating information that could help find the signs of earthquakes. There are 80 similar satellite projects worldwide, but this is the first high-school based program of its kind in Canada. 30 Manitoba high school students are having a hand in designing and building the satellite, in cooperation with aerospace experts and 10 students from the University of Manitoba, and with support from two other organizations. The Win-Cube project is not something that goes on a piece of paper; it is real-world engineering, allowing high school students to have an opportunity to learn more about the exciting world of engineering through their participation in this challenging program.

"Question: The reason why there isn't ""earthquake weather"" is that. _ . Context: An earthquake is a trembling or shaking of the ground caused by the sudden release of energy stored in the rocks below the surface. Generally, earthquakes last only seconds. Strong ground shaking during a medium to large earthquake generally lasts about 10 to 30 seconds. Aftershocks can occur once in a while for weeks or even months. Many people think that there is an ""earthquake season"" or a kind of "" earthquake weather "".As a matter of fact, there isn't. Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year and at time of day or night. Earthquakes occur under all weather conditions-sunny, wet. or cold without any special weather tendency . Also, you don't need to worry that the ground will open up and swallow people when earthquakes occur. Open ground cracks may form during an earthquake, for example, to land sliding or ground falling. However, such cracks tend to be open gaps (they don't "" swallow"") that a person could stand in afterwards. The safest place in an earthquake is an open field because buildings and falling objects can injure or kill you. If you are indoors, when you feel the ground start to shake, take cover immediately under a table or strong piece of furniture, placing something between falling objects and yourself. Don't "" attempt to use the stairs or an elevator to get out of the building.. </s>"	an earthquake can happen at any time and in any kind of weather. </s>

"Question: The text is mainly about _ . Context: When Siva Kalyan was born, his backbone was deformed resulting in a lifelong difficulty in walking. But that hasn't stopped the nine-year-old from becoming a prodigy . Until he was three-and-a-half years old, Siva could not even crawl. Wanting the best treatment for their son, Siva's parents moved with him from India to Australia and later to the USA. In the USA, his parents enrolled him in the second grade based on his age. But his teachers soon realized they had a genius. Siva was then tested for the eighth grade, but it was soon found out that he was actually qualified for college courses. As one advanced course was not enough, the brilliant boy is now taking two courses from Stanford University. Due to the treatment he received, Siva's physical condition has improved as well. But none of _ ""just happened"". It was his parents' understanding and correct guidance, and the loving care of his grandparents that contributed to the growth of the genius. Siva's highly educated and hardworking family has brought him up on the basis of certain principles. The family believes that once a strong foundation is built for the child in English and mathematics, the child is equipped to master any other subject, law, history, or engineering. It is equally important to recognize the strengths of a child rather than forcing the child to do things that he may not want to do. Siva's parents helped. Siva focus his energies on his strength, which is mathematics. At the same time they took care to see that he had friends to play with and enjoyed a few recreational activities. The only activity that's restricted for Siva is viewing television. Siva watches TV only for 30 minutes a day and video games are a bonus for special occasions. Thanks to his mother who is a singer, Siva has also learned music and even won the first and second prize at two competitions. In sports, he likes to swim. He began to learn swimming to strengthen his muscles, and by the age of eight he was able to swim a kilometer in both the backstroke and the freestyle. </s>"	the growth of a disabled child prodigy </s>

"Question: What is the best title of the passage? Context: As South Africa starts to celebrate 20 years of freedom in South Africa, the moment is ruined with disappointment for many of the nation's poorest, who feel change has been slow to come. Today thousands of people are expected to gather near Cape Town to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release. The moment when Mr. Mandela, who was 71 and had spent 27 years in prison on Robben Island, walked free marked a change from apartheid to multi-racial democracy . He went on to become the country's first black president. His African National Congress (ANC) party has reduced poverty, built houses and delivered water, electricity and schools to blacks. Still, though, needs remain great. With some observers comparing the event to South Africa's equal of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the occasion has sparked debate about unhappy promises and riots among the nation's very poorest, who feel short-changed. Agnes Ntali shares her two-roomed Department of Housing in Soweto with three grandchildren. The 55-year-old widow, who first came to Soweto with her husband in the days after Nelson Mandela's release has been waiting 10 years to be re-housed. ""We have stayed here for a long time now but nothing has changed. Now we are free but we are not happy... we have no jobs and we are hungry,"" she told The Times newspaper. ""Since Mandela left, there have been no changes, "" she said. Last week the ""informal settlement"" she shares with several hundred other very poor black South Africans, broke out into violence. Tired of unhappy promises to provide electricity and toilets, some people cut off the power to new council houses nearby. A riot started and the police responded with teargas and rubber bullets. Across the nation, black townships are exploding in violent protests about services they are still waiting for. It is a sign that the poor are prepared to wait no longer for the better life which was forecast 20 years ago, but has, for thousands, failed to appear. </s>"	The Poor in South Africa Face Broken Dreams on Mandela's Anniversary </s>

Fruit from the new Meat Trees, developed by British scientists using the gene technology, is closely like ordinary grape-fruit. But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef! ""Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,"" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. ""Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too."" Although it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. ""We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,"" Dr. Vincent says. ""When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell."" Those who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. ""I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,"" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. ""But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all."" Meat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year.

"Question: What does the author state is the most important reason men die five years earlier on average than women? Context: If you're a male and you're reading this, congratulations: you're a survivor. According to statistics, you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer as a woman, and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you'll die on average five years before a woman. There are many reasons for this--typically, men take more risks than women and are more likely to drink and smoke--but perhaps more importantly, men don't go to the doctor. ""Men aren't seeing doctors as often as they should,"" says Dr. Gullotta. ""This is particularly so for the over-40s, when diseases tend to strike."" Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year. Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old man who had delayed doing anything about his smoker's cough for a year. ""When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer,"" he says. ""Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged his life."" According to a recent survey, 95% of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group. ""A lot of men think they're undefeatable,"" Gullota says. ""They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think, 'Geez, if it could happen to him, ...'"" Then there's the ostrich approach. ""Some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,"" says Dr. Ross Cartmill. ""Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,"" Cartmill says. He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups. Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says. ""But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death."" </s>"	Men don't seek medical care as often as women. </s>

MIT believe in the passion of learning, the value of working and teaching methods. MIT's teaching power is quite strong. There are eight Nobel winners and many other national and international winners in the teacher group of MIT. MIT is proud of these top scholars and thinkers. The ratio of teachers and students in MIT is about 1 to 7.5. About 63 percent of the classes have fewer than 20 students each. Only 4 percent of the classes have more than 100 students each.

Question: Ancient people first used umbrellas as _ . Context: To us, it seems so natural to put up an umbrella to keep the water off when it rains. But in fact the umbrella was not invented as protection against the rain. Its first use was as a shade against the sun. Nobody knows who first invented it, but the umbrella was used in very ancient times. Probably the first to use it were the Chinese, back in the eleventh century BC. We know that the umbrella was used in ancient Egypt and Babylon as a sunshade. And there was a strange thing connected with its use : it became a symbol of honor and power . In the Far East in ancient times, the umbrella was allowed to be used only by those in high office or by royal people such as the kings or queens. In Europe, the Greeks were the first to use the umbrella as a sunshade. The umbrella was in common use in ancient Greece, but it is believed that the first people in Europe to use the umbrella as protection against the rain were the ancient Romans. During the middle ages in Europe, the use of the umbrella almost disappeared. Then it appeared again in Italy in the late sixteenth century. And again it became a symbol of power. Umbrellas have not changed much in style during all this time, though they have become much lighter in weight. It wasn't until the twentieth century that the umbrellas for women began to be made in all kinds of colors. </s>	protection against the sun </s>
"Question: Who would suffer most in the USrecession? Context: The US recession has opened up the biggest gap between male and female unemployment rates since records began in 1948, as men bear the blow of the economy's decline. Men have lost almost 80% of the 5.1 million jobs since the recession started, pushing the male unemployment rate to 8.8%. The female jobless rate has hit 7%. This is a dramatic change of the trend over the past few years, where the rates of male and female unemployment barely differed, at about 5%. It also means that women could soon overtake men as the majority of the prefix = st1 /USlabour force. Men have been badly hurt because they dominate those industries that have been affected: 9 in every 10 construction workers are male, as are 7 in every 10 manufacturing workers. These two sectors alone have lost almost 2.5 million jobs. Women, in contrast, tend to hold more stable jobs and make up 75% of the most unaffected sectors of all: education and healthcare. ""It protects them a little bit and softens the blow,"" said Francine Blau, a labour market economist at CornellUniversity. ""I think we are going to see this pattern until the recovery."" The widening gap between male and female joblessness means many US families are totally reliant on the income the woman brings in. Since women earn on average 20% less than men, that is putting extra stress on many households. </s>"	Building workers. </s>
"Question: Marraccini stores the gum for six months in order to _ . Context: Some people make art with paint, and others use pencil or clay. But Italian artist Maurizio Savini prefers to use bright pink gum--after it has been chewed. Savini makes huge sculptures of bears and even people out of used chewing gum. Each sculpture requires thousands of pieces of gum. ""I like to use chewing gum because it seemed to me a material that can be used in many ways compared with those used by the conventional arts such as painting,"" Savini says. How does he do it? The process is a lot like working with clay. ""I work the chewing gum when it is warm and shape it with a knife,"" says Savini. Then, he puts a chemical onto each gum sculpture to make the gum stay in place. Savini's sticky art has been shown in cities like London, Paris, and Rome, where he lives today. Savini isn't the only artist to work with gum. His pink sculptures have inspired artists all over the world to get creative with the sticky matter. London artist Ben Wilson paints small paintings onto flat pieces of chewed gum he finds stuck to streets and sidewalks. In Canada, Jason Kronenwald uses different colored gum to make portraits of famous people. Kronenwald seldom chews gum himself. Instead, his friends help chew gum for him while he's working. ""At times it can make me _ , but I just pay attention to the colors I need and get the sculpture going,"" he says. In America, Jamie Marraccini's art depends on color, so he tests different kinds of gum before using them.

Context: Made from the hide of bushy-haired animals, fur is known as the first material used for clothing.It was used by early humans like the hominoids to keep warm during the winter season or when they traveled to cooler regions.Traditionally, animals were hunted down to produce fur coats.At present though, some animals like the mink and the fox are bred and farmed for their fur.Now, wearing fur is considered a luxury because of its price and availability. Fur coats are produced and used all over the world especially in cooler countries like Russia and Northern Europe.These are usually made from the fur of bigger animals like bears, wolves and foxes which are hunted down for their meat and hide.Because of this, several of their species have become endangereD.Yet, until now, there has been no law passed to regulate the fur industry.That's why Animal rights groups, including stars, continue to campaign against fur clothing including fur coat manufacturing.

Context: If you like texting and are trying to lose weight, a new study found that using texting to track diet and exercise habits may help you lose weight. Previous research has shown that keeping food and exercise diaries improves the likelihood of success when you are trying to lose weight. Using a computer or a pen and paper to record information, however, can be a burden and cause some people to give up. Duke University researchers said using text messages to track eating and exercise habits can save time, and increase the chances that people will stick with their weight-loss rules. The study included 26 obese women with an average age of 38. The women used daily texting as part of their weight-loss program. The text messages focused on tracking personalized goals, such as avoiding sugary drinks or walking 10,000 steps a day. Messages also provided brief feedback and tips. Every morning, the women received a text from an automated system that said, ""Please text yesterday's personal information of steps you walked and how many sugary drinks you had."" Based on the women's responses to the text message, the system sent another text with personalized feedback and tips. After six months, the women who used daily texting lost an average of nearly 3 pounds, while another group of women who used traditional methods to keep food and exercise diaries gained an average of 2.5 pounds, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. ""Text messaging has become popular and may be an effective method to simplify tracking of diet and exercise behavior,"" Dori Steinberg, who was responsible for this research, said. Steinberg said, ""Text messaging offers several advantages compared to other self-monitoring methods. Unlike web-based diet and exercise diaries, data in a text message can be entered quickly on nearly all cellphone platforms so it is very convenient to receive feedback.

"Question: What is basically needed for MEXICA to start to write a story? Context: While it may be unlikely for a computer to write a best seller, a technology expert has created a computer program that writes its own fiction stories with minimal user input. The program, called MEXICA, is the first to generate original stories based on computerized representations of emotions and tensions between characters. An Internet survey was carried out to see the popularity of the computer-generated stories, other computerized stories and stories written solely by a human. The result was that readers ranked MEXICA stories highest for flow and coherence, structure, content, suspense and overall quality. Rafael Perezy Perez, the creator of MEXICA, explained that a story might begin with something as basic as, ""The enemy wounded the knight. The princess cured the knight. The knight killed the enemy. The knight rewarded the princess. The end."" The program reads characters as variables and assigns a numerical value, between a continuum from -3 to +3, to emotional connections that are defined as either amorous or non-amorous. The numerical value is equivalent to the degree of emotion, with -3 being intense hate and +3 being intense love. The program also understands story tension, such as linking the word ""wounded"" with tension. This too is assigned a numerical value. Once these clusters of emotional links and tensions are established, the program begins what is called an ""engagement reflection cycle"". Basically this involves searching a database of story actions and other happenings, which are called ""atoms"", and determines the best match for the characters and contexts for that moment. The process repeats itself again and again until the system can no longer make any matches. At this point, the computer analyzes the story for coherence and ""interestingness"". The program views a story as interesting when tension levels increase and fall throughout the piece. If the program finds that the story is boring or incoherent in places, it will replace or insert atoms until a version is thought to be satisfactory. </s>"	The human operator should come up with a simple storyline. </s>

A 2007 study by Charles Czeisler found a switch to longer days could be beneficial, especially for frequent travelers, shift workers, astronauts and those who experience trouble sleeping or waking. In a similar study, Czeisler showed the body's natural clock averages 24 hours and 11 minutes in both young and older people.The current 360degree clock has 720 minutes, giving each minute 0.5 degree.With the new 25hour day, 30 minutes is added to each 12hour period making each minute 0.48 degree. While still a relatively small movement-the 25th Hour Coalition has 160 Facebook members, Behan is hoping for large changes.""The goal is to get as many women on board; there's no harm in just trying it out and seeing.If it gets big, maybe the government will decide to standardize it."" A recent online survey by Reader's Digest, which included 150 people in each of the 13 countries, suggests it's not just Canadians looking for longer days.Readers were asked""what would you do with an extra hour""if given a choice between sleep, work, exercise and family time.In Spain, half of respondents said they'd like an extra hour in the day to devote to family time.The same was found for respondents in Brazil, the US and Britain, who chose family time over sleep, which came in at a close second.Only in India did work top the list with 50 percent of respondents claiming they could use an extra hour at the office. </s>"	the 25hour clock fits the body's natural clock more </s>

"Question: By saying that ""my spirits ebb"" (Para. 1), the author means that _ . Context: Every April I am troubled by the same concern -- that spring might not occur this year. The landscape looks dull, with hills, sky and forest appearing gray. My spirits ebb, as they did during an April snowfall when I first came to Maine 15 years ago. ""Just wait,"" a neighbor advised. ""You'll wake up one morning and spring will just be here."" And look, on May 3 that year I awoke to a green so amazing as to be almost electric, as if spring were simply a matter of flipping a switch. Hills, sky and forest revealed their purples, blues and green. Leaves had unfolded and daffodils were fighting their way heavenward. Then there was the old apple tree. It sits on an undeveloped lot in my neighborhood. It belongs to no one and therefore to everyone. The tree's dark twisted branches stretch out in unpruned abandon. Each spring it blossoms so freely that the air becomes filled with the scent of apple. Until last year, I thought I was the only one aware of this tree. And then one day, in a bit of spring madness, I set out with pruner to remove a few disorderly branches. No sooner had I arrived under the tree than neighbors opened their windows and stepped onto their porches. These were people I barely knew and seldom spoke to, but it was as if I had come uninvited into their personal gardens. My mobile-home neighbor was the first to speak.""You're not cutting it down, are you?"" she asked anxiously. Another neighbor frowned as I cut off a branch. ""Don't kill it, now,"" he warned. Soon half the neighborhood had joined me under the apple tree. It struck me that I had lived there for five years and only now was learning these people's names, what they did for a living and how they passed the winter. It was as if the old apple tree was gathering us under its branches for the purpose of both acquaintanceship and shared wonder. I couldn't help recalling Robert Frost's words: The trees that have it in their pent-up buds To darken nature and be summer woods One thaw led to another. Just the other day I saw one of my neighbors at the local store. He remarked how this recent winter had been especially long and complained of not having seen or spoken at length to anyone in our neighborhood. And then, he looked at me and said, ""We need to prune that apple tree again."" </s>"	he feels blue </s>
"Question: The essay""Time Out or Bum Out for the Next Generation.""suggests that _ . Context: In Britain and other countries,young people sometimes take a""gap year"",a year off between high school and college.This idea never gained a big following in America.Recent news reports have suggested that interest may be growing,though there are no official numbers. Charles Deacon,.Dean of Admissions at Georgetown University in Washington,D.C.,estimates that in the current first-year class of 1,600 students,only about 25 decided to take a year off.He says this number hasn't changed much over the years. Mr.Deacon says the most common reason for taking a""gap year""is to have a chance to travel,but he says international students may take a""gap year""to meet requirements at home for military duty. Some high school graduates see a year off as a chance to recover after twelve years of required education,but it can also give students a chance to explore their interests.Students hoping to be doctors,for example,could learn about the profession by volunteering in a hospital. Many colleges and universities support gap-year projects by permitting students to delay their admission.Expels say students can grow emotionally and intellectually as they work at something they enjoy. The Harvard admissions office has an essay on its Web site called""Time Out or Bum Out for the Next Generation.''It praises the idea of taking time off to step back,think and enjoy gaining life experiences outside the pressure of studies.It also notes that students are sometimes admitted to Harvard or other colleges partly because they did something unusual with that time. Of course,a gap year is not for everyone.Students might miss their friends who go on directly to college,and parents might worry that their children will decide not to go to college once they take time off.Another concern is money.A year off,away from home,can be costly. Holly Bull's job is to specialize in helping students plan their gap year.She notes that several books have been written about this subject.She says these books along with media attention and the availability of information on the Internet have increased interest in the idea of a year off, and she points out that many gap-year programs cost far less than a year of college. </s>"	some famous universities encourage students to gain more life experiences </s>

Making new money is a very unique job and no easy task.It has up to 65 steps When the money in circulation gets dirty and worn out, it is replaced with new money The old money is taken from banks and brought to places where it is destroyed Usually, the old money is burned.The burned money is replaced by new paper money If old money is being replaced, then new money is printed in a place called a mint .Large sheets 01 paper are printed with many pictures of some currency .These large sheets are cut into individual bills.The individual bills are then put together in big stacks and then sent to banks. Sometimes the mint will make a new bill with a new picture (portraits of statesman and places of interest are favoured) or a new colour. It is not easy for the government to make a new bill. It takes a long time, and there are many steps to go through before a new bill can be sent to banks, first, people m the government decide that a new kind of bill is needed Then, they ask and artist to design the new bill.A different artist cuts the new picture into a soft piece of metal called a die.The dies are made and put onto large printing machines.Then, very special paper is used, which no one but the mint can have.Along with this special paper, the mint also prints currency using special colours.After the dies print the new currency onto the paper, the bills are cut, stacked, and sent off to the banks. </s>	a piece of metal that puts the picture on the money </s>
Question: What does the passage mainly talk about? Context: If you're looking for a fairly painless way to lose weight, researchers at Brigham Young University have a new solution for you: Put yourself on a regular sleep schedule. People who keep a regular sleep routine have a lower body fat than those who keep irregular sleep hours, says a new study. Led by Bruce Bailey, professor of exercise science, researchers followed 300 female college students aged 19 to 26, who were given activity trackers to watch their movements and activities, including waking and sleeping times . Researchers also measured their body composition before and after the one-week study period. What the researchers found: Body fat varied with sleep quantity. Women who slept between 8 and 8.5 hours a night had the lowest body fat. While those who slept less than 7 hours or over 9 hours had higher body fat. High quality sleep was associated with lower body fat while poor sleep was connected with higher body fat. Waking and going to sleep at the same time every day was most strongly linked with lower body fat. The difference in body weight was greater with more variation in sleep pattern. Women whose sleep patterns varied by 90 minutes a night had higher body fat than those whose sleep patterns varied by 60 minutes or less on average. The study followed up on a body of research conducted over the last few years that ties quality and quantity of sleep to weight loss and better weight control. While researchers don't know exactly how sleep schedules affect body weight and fat, other studies have shown that sleep has an effect on physical activity, appetite , and the hormones that control metabolism , and the signals that tell us we're full. </s>	A study on the relationship between sleep and body weight. </s>

"Question: What can we learn from Robert's experience? Context: 12-year-old Robert Looks Twice appears to be the typical all-American boy. He is the quarterback of his school's football team, student council president and one of the top students in his class. But he hasn't forgotten his Lakota Sioux root. Unlike most children on the reservation , he keeps his hair long, a symbol of strength, and he performs at powwows , traditionally known as wacipis, where he is a champion of the traditional Lakota dance. Robert was inspired to start dancing by his grandfather, John Tail, who had a small role in the famous film about Indian Amercans, Dances with Wolves. Six years ago, John passed away, and Robert wears little wolves on his clothes in his memory. We are told that his last name, "" Looks Twice"", came about because his ancestors were cautious and always took a second look. Robert lives in a trailer with his grandmother, uncle and eight other cousins. When he gives us a tour, the trailer is falling apart. "" It is getting ready to cave in ,"" says Robert about the kitchen floor. The family also put trash bags on the ceiling, because it's leaking. "" When it rains it gets all my shirts wet,"" he says of another leak in his bedroom. Often the electricity goes off and the family have to use the burners on the stove to heat the house. This kind of poverty is typical of the reservation. The reservation is the third poorest county in America, and Robert's community, Manderson, is known for its high crime rate. But despite all the temptations of drugs and alcohol around him, Robert remain focused on being the first person in his family to go to college and then a very big dream. "" I want to be the first Native American President,"" Robert said. "" I want to build better houses and clean up the reservation, because it's bad.

"Question: Which of the following is NOT true? Context: At three a.m., Jack Mills was sitting at the controls of the mail train. The train was made up of 13 cars. At the end of the train, 71 mailmen sat sorting the mails. Inside the second car, there were only five mailmen and 128 bags full of five-pound notes. This train had run more than 100 years without being robbed. At three minutes past three, Mills and his helper, David Whitby, saw a yellow warning light. They slowed the train, and then stopped. Whitby went to the telephone beside the track. It was out of order. Then he saw a man moving between the second and the third cars. Before Whitby could give a warning, he was knocked down by two men. Mills' cars with all the mailmen had been disconnected by the robbers. At the bridge, the bags of money were unloaded from the train and thrown into waiting trucks.

"Question: Examples are given in Para.4 to show that _ . Context: Like any awards ceremony of its age, the Oscars, now in its 85th year, has been trying hard to change. So how did that go this year? When host Seth MacFarlane noted in his opening speech that it was the first time the Academy Awards had a theme, I thought: ""well, that's a good start."" But when he revealed that the theme was a tribute to(...) musicals, I was less sure. After all, it's not the first time that musicals have featured at the Oscars. In 2007, the cast of Dream-girls gave a special performance directed by movie director and musical veteran Bill Condon. Then there was the memorable 2009 show hosted by Hugh Jackman, who screams musicals. With Beyonce Knowles and Anne Hathaway, he performed several hit songs from move musical. And in 2010, how did Neil Patrick Harris introduce the hosts? By performing a musical number. So I guess the Oscars could have done better this year. But I must admit, there were more music performances in the three-and-a -half-hour show than ever before. This suggests the Oscars has dropped some of its arrogance and wants to offer audiences more entertainment. It's a timely move as the Golden Globes, also known as the ""big party,"" has become a threat to the Oscars, stealing viewers and even its reputation. Just look at the Oscars' winning list this year. You can't blame the academy for wanting to stick it to the Golden Globes. While they hired Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to host the show--certainly more audience-friendly than MacFarlane-- and Bill Clinton was invited as a presenter, who did viewers get at the Oscars?

As the movie begins, the spacecraft is approaching the Sun. Suddenly, the operating system is out of control;then the crew receive a frightening signal from the original IcarusI which was sent to carry out the same task seven years ago. Should the crew continue flying to the Sun in the endangered ship? The question is not so much about whether any crew member can survive--the chances of that hardly exist--but should they try to grab the other bomb in IcarusI and take it to the Sun?

So there is little possibility for me to go home for Christmas. Now I am able to get through Christmas with some moments of joy: First, you are advised to search your area for stores that carry items from your home country or town. Buy food, candles and some other things that mean something to you. Hold on to the traditions from your home that you think are important even if other people think they are stupid. But keep in mind to be open for new traditions from wherever you might be, because those traditions are as important to those people around you as yours are to you. For me that includes celebrating Christmas on the 24th. Call, write Christmas cards, buy gifts and mail them to loved ones, just as if you were there. If you try to pretend as if the holiday doesn't exist, you are just going to make it worse. Introduce your traditions to your loved ones, especially your kids. It will only enrich their celebration of the holiday to have some unique traditions in their home. Little by little it will become their tradition and it's fun for them to try something new. Find clubs, churches or organizations that are from your home country. Chances are that they will have some celebration with some of your traditions which you can join in. Food is one of the most important factors in any kind of tradition. Find the recipe of that cake your grandmother used and make it your tradition to bake that particular cake. Call up your parents and get them to send you some of your favorite childhood ornaments for your tree. Pay attention to new traditions, talk to your family about which ones you want to make your own and stick with them. If you are far away from home, Christmas can never be the same as you experienced it before, but it is important to remember these traditions while appreciating the new ones. Keep an open mind and find a compromise between old and new traditions. </s>	ask for some ornaments </s>

"Question: Which of the followings shows American stores offer convenience to customers in this passage? Context: Would you like to be a king or queen? To have people waiting on you hand and foot? Many Americans experience this royal treatment every day. How? By being customers. The American idea of customer service is to make each customer the center of attention. Need proof? Just listen to the commercials. Most of them sound like the McDonald's ad: ""We do it all for you."" Actually, not all stores in America roll out the red carpet for their customers. But wherever you go, good customer service means making customers feel special. People going shopping in America can expect to be treated with respect from the very beginning. Most places don't have a ""furniture street"" or a ""computer road"" which allow you to compare prices easily. Instead, people often ""let their fingers do the walking"" through the store hot lines. From the first ""hello"", customers receive a satisfying response to their questions. This initial contact can help them decide where to shop. When customers get to the store, they are treated as honored guests. Customers don't usually find store clerks sitting around watching TV or playing cards. Instead, the clerks greet them warmly and offer to help them find what they want. In most stores, the clear signs that label each department make shopping a breeze. Customers usually don't have to ask how much items cost, since prices are clearly marked. And unless they're at a flea market or a yard sale, they don't bother trying to bargain. When customers are ready to check out, they find the nearest and shortest checkout lane. But as Murphy's Law would have it, whichever lane they get in, all the other lanes will move faster. Good stores open new checkout lanes when the lanes get too long. Some even offer express lanes for customers with 10 items or less. After they pay for their purchases, customers receive a smile and a warm ""thank you"" from the clerk. Many stores even allow customers to take their shopping carts out to the parking lot. That way, they don't have to carry heavy bags out to the car. </s>"	Some stores open new checkout lanes when the lanes are crowded. </s>

So although they may eat the same volume of food, their calorie intake has increased. Now that 40 to 45 percent of their calories come from fat,"" says Chwang. Although on the whole Asians tend to thinness, culture--namely Asians' hospitality--is a reason for the fatness of today's generation, according to Chwang. ""Asian people love food,"" she says."" Eating and drinking are important social and family functions."" In the past, however, big meals were only hosted on special occasions, as people were more careful with money. In today's climate of wealth and remarkable consumption,10-course meals are no longer reserved for significant occasions.

"Question: What does the phrase ""hit the 'off' button"" refer to? Context: They say that soon, we will be able to receive more than 500 television networks on cable or by satellite. Some people think that it's useless to have that many channels. Their usual criticism goes something like this: ""I already get more channels on my TV than I have time to watch. No one needs to see that much TV. There's not enough time in the day to watch all that!""They also say that most of what's on television now isn't worth watching in the first place. I think they're missing the point. If the local library wanted to add another 5,000 books, would we say, ""That's silly, we'll never have time to read all those books""? The point is that we would have more choices. I don't believe that most people should watch more television. And if we had 500 or even 1,000 channels to choose from, we wouldn't have to spend more time watching TV. We would, however, have more programs to choose from. That means that the quality of our viewing time would be improved. I think the more channels we have, the better. Give me more choices! If they're not worth my time, I'll just hit the ""off"" button. </s>"	Turn off the TV. </s>
"Question: Which of the following words can replace the word ""erodes"" in Para 2? Context: Children are hooked on computers. Some spend up to six hours a day on their gadgets. They can be playing games live with others elsewhere in the world, updating their status on social media, texting friends or looking for the latest app to download to their tablets or smart phones. This worried Martin Strott, headmaster of the Old Hall School in Wellington, in the west of England. He was so concerned that he challenged his students to take part in a week of 'digital detox'. Strott told the local newspaper, the Shropshire Star, that he encourages the pupils to have a good knowledge of the computer from a young age, but is concerned that too much screen time will affect the development of their social skills. He said that this over-reliance on digital devices ""erodes family time and they're missing out on messages from body language and facial expressions from those around them"". According to the headmaster, the parents are happy with the movement. But what about the children? Nine-year-old Fred usually spends around two hours on his gadgets at home after school and around 12 hours on weekends. For him, the digital detox experience was ""really hard"". Fred spent it playing outside, especially basketball. He said that he'll probably engage in different activities from now on but he did miss his phone and online games. The idea of keeping children away from their tech for a while to prevent 'addiction' is not particularly new. There have been similar movements in the US. But are they effective in the long run? Well, even if kids go back to their gadgets, the hope is that at least they'll think about how they use their time. What about you: do you spend too many hours hooked on your digital devices? </s>"	ruins </s>
