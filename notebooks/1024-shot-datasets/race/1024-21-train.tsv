The passenger who had called him back wanted	"Six people were traveling in a compartment on a train. Five of them were quiet and well behaved , but the sixth was a rude young man who was causing a lot of trouble to the other passengers. At last this young man got out of the station with his two heavy bags. None of the other passengers helped him, but one of them waited until the rude young man was very far away, and then opened the window to him, "" You left something behind in the compartment!"" Then he closed the window again. The young man turned around and hurried back with his two bags. He was very tired when he arrived, but he shouted through the window, "" What did I leave behind?"" As the train began to move again, the passenger who had called him back opened the window and said, "" A very bad impression!"""	['to punish him for his bad behavior']
Which of the following is NOT true about the newly found ring?	"Astronomers recently found another ring around the planet Saturn -- and it's the biggest one yet. This newly discovered ring stretches about 15 million miles across, which makes a loop big enough to fit a billion Earths inside. It may be even bigger and reach 22 million miles across at its diameter . Saturn's new ring is now the biggest known ring in the solar system. This ring, like Saturn's other rings, is not one solid piece of rock. Instead, it is made up of millions or billions of tiny rocks that orbit the planet all together and give the appearance of a unified ring. Unlike the more visible rings, however, this big one is mysterious -- the pieces are far apart, and the ring cannot be seen from the surface of the Earth. If all the pieces were stuck together, they'd be slightly bigger than a rock a half-mile wide. Astronomers suspect that the newly discovered ring gets its material from Saturn's outermost moon, Phoebe. For example, the dust in the ring circles Saturn in the same path and the same direction as Phoebe. Plus, the surface of Phoebe is marked with holes and places where rock has been knocked away, the result of collisions between Phoebe and other moons and rocks. These collisions could have sent dust out into space to become part of the big ring. The discovery of the ring could help explain other mysteries surrounding Saturn and its dozens of moons. The moon called Iapetus, for example, is two-toned: one side is gray; the other more reddish. Iapetus is within the newly discovered ring, but it orbits in the opposite direction. As a result, some researchers say, debris from the ring may have coated and color1ed one side of Iapetus as it moved through space, and left the other side alone. ""The cause of Iapetus' strange color1 distribution ... has been a puzzle that now seems solved,"" said Joseph Burns, a scientist. But not everyone agrees. Some think the ring alone may not be able to explain Iapetus' funny color1ing."	['It can be seen from the Earth.']
Which of the following is true?	White bread is thought to have a long history.In ancient Egypt, people discovered white bread about 8,000 years ago. There is something interesting about white bread.In the old times,many cities in ancient Greece said they owned the best quality.In the middle ages,bakers in England carefully _ their secrets of making bread.Anyone who hoped to learn the art of making bread must spend seven years on it.In times of war and disasters ,bread and wheat were the first things to bekept closely. However,in the mid-1800s,an engineer from Switzerland invented a new kind mill to produce more white bread at a faster speed.Soon bread making became widely popular all over Europe.In 1928,America had the first company to produce and sell mountains of white bread.

We learn that compared to Americans, Australians _ .	"Once upon a time, there was a scholar who wanted to gain more knowledge each day even though he had already gained enough knowledge. One day, he came to visit a saint and wanted to be his student. The saint provided some tea. He slowly filled the scholar's cup: the cup was full, yet he kept pouring and pouring. The scholar burst out, ""Stop! You can't add anything to something that's already full!"" The saint set down the teapot and replied, ""Exactly."" Whether it's the silence between notes in music, or some open time in your schedule, you need space to act effectively. Yet most of us, myself included, tend to stuff as much as possible into whatever room is available-closets, schedules, budgets, relationships, and even the mind itself. However, some people know how to avoid overstuffing their life. For example, in Australia, it seemed that most people there operated at about 85% of their capacity ,unlike Americans pushing as close to 100% as possible. So when you run into Australians you know in the street, they have time to hang out and talk with you. Remember the cup: its value is in the space, the emptiness it holds. How to empty your ""cup""? Be mindful of the element of space, openness , and emptiness in your life. This includes room in a drawer, the volume of air in a kitchen, and open-mindedness in a friend. Sometimes you're just stuck with a big bucket of tasks yet to do. But at least empty the bucket faster than you fill it with new tasks. Put some space between finishing one thing and staring another. For example, after sending one email, take a breath before replying to another one. Drop the stuff you can no longer afford to _ around. At sea level, you can run with a brick in your backpack, but if you're hiking on a mountain, that brick has got to go."	['spare more time for themselves']
The novel Unstoppable intends to inspire kids that _ .	"Former National Football League player and children's author Tim Green has added another book to his list of accomplishments: Unstoppable. The book tells the story of a 12-year -old boy named Harrison, who survives life in a cruel foster home before he finally finds a loving family. Once he settles in and realizes his natural football ability, tragedy strikes again and he loses his leg to a deadly bone cancer. Unstoppable follows Harrison's incredible journey as he faces many challenges in his life. Tim Green says he decided to write a novel about a kid facing cancer after watching how his wife fought to survive her own illness. ""Her mental and physical toughness were more heroic to me than anything I'd ever seen in the national sports leagues,"" Green told TFK Kid Reporter Zachary J. Lewis. After watching his wife's battle, Green said, he knew he needed to write about a person who struggled through a serious illness. But because the target age for his books is teen, he needed to tell the story through the eyes of someone that age. When friends introduced Green to Jeffrey Keith, Green knew he had found the right person to help him"" capture the heroism that it takes to fight cancer"". Cancer-survivor Jeffrey Keith lost his leg to disease at age twelve, but went on to be the goalie for the Boston College Division 1 Lacrosse Team and was also the first _ to run 3,300 miles across the country. When Green heard Jeffrey Keith's story, he knew it was the perfect narrative on which to base his next book. TFK asked Keith what it felt like to read Unstoppable for the first time. ""Tim captured what it felt like for me to go through this experience and battle back,"" Keith said. ""After I read the book, Tim asked me to describe it in one word, and I said 'awesome'. Tim's work sends a message to all the kids across the country that are facing obstacles that can have nothing to do with cancer: you are all unstoppable, as long as you believe it."""

When a person is badly hurt and is unconscious, he _ .	Suppose a man has a car accident. He is hurt badly and is _ , that is, he can't think, speak, or hear. His family takes him to the hospital. The doctors tell the family that his brain is dead. A machine can make him breathe . Now the patient's family must answer some difficult questions. Should they think he is dead? Should they ask the doctors to use the machine to make him breathe? Sometimes machines can make an unconscious person breathe for years. However if his brain is dead , he will never think, speak, or hear again. Then, should his family ask the doctors not to use the machine and let him die? Someone who is unconscious can't say he wants to die. Can his family say this for him? Some people think this is a good idea. Some think otherwise. Many people are hurt when machines keep a person alive. The unconscious person doesn't know it. Machines only make the family and friends hurt longer.	"[""doesn't feel pain""]"
What can be a suitable title for the text?	If you need to spend time on the road,it's important to find ways to keep safe on your feet. Don't suppose it's your right of way. Yes, you might be crossing at the right place, at the right time, within the crosswalk area, but you are still exposed to danger. It could be a distracted driver, or a cyclist with a loose sense of traffic rules, so you could still get hurt. You can be in the right legally, but that won't be much help when you're in the hospital. Follow pedestrian signals. Just as drivers aren't supposed to speed up to beat a light when crossing through an intersection, pedestrians need to take the same care when obeying their own signals. If the hand is flashing and the countdown is into single digits ,stay where you are. Trying to outrun the flashing hand is unsafe,especially as cars try to clear the intersection before the light turns red. Give drivers enough time to stop when crossing. Don't suppose that drivers will jam on their brakes when you hit the crosswalk signals. Some provinces, such as Alberta, issue a ticket if you don't give drivers enough time to brake. Cross quickly. Once you've followed all of the other rules, and it is safe to cross the street, don't then just wander along in front of six lanes of traffic. There's no need to run or jog, but respect the drivers who respected you enough to stop for you.	['Tips to Keep Safe on Your Feet']
According to the writer of the letter, college is a time _ .	"Dear XXX, As we drove off from Columbia, I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind. First, I want to tell you how proud we are. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. You should be as proud of yourself as we are. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"". I encourage you to be inquisitive , but I also want to tell you: ""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten."" What I mean by that is -- the material taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. Do your best in classes, but don't let pressure get to you. If you graduate and learn something in your four years, we would feel happy. Your Columbia degree will take you far, even if you don't graduate with honors. So please don't give yourself pressure. The only thing that matters is that you learned. The only measurement you should use is that you tried. Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience. Pick a few friends and become really close to them -- pick the ones who are genuine and sincere to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks, or even personalities. If you think you like someone, tell her. You have very little to lose. People are not perfect, so as long as they are genuine and sincere, trust them and be good to them. They will give back. This is my secret of success -- that I am genuine with people and trust them (unless they do something to lose my trust). College is the four years where you have: *the greatest amount of free time *the first chance to be independentk%s5$u *the most flexibility to change *the lowest risk for making mistakes So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny. May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be. Love, XXX"	['during which one needs to learn to be independent']
According to the passage, students who date in middle school may _	"Students who date in middle school have significantly worse study skills. They are four times more likely to drop out of school and report twice as much alcohol and tobacco use as their single classmates, according to new research from the University of Georgia. ""Romantic relationships are a trademark of adolescence, but very few studies have examined how adolescents differ in the development of these relationships,"" said Pamela Orpinas, study author and professor in the College of Public Health and head of the Department of Health Promotion and Behavior.[: _ Z _ X _ X _ K] Orpinas followed a group of 624 students over a seven-year period from 6th to 12th grade. Each year, the group of students completed a survey indicating whether they had dated and reported the frequency of different behaviors, including the use of drugs and alcohol. Their teachers completed questionnaires about the students' academic efforts. He found some students never or hardly ever reported dating from middle to high school, and these students had consistently the best study skills according to their teachers. Other students dated infrequently in middle school but increased the frequency of dating in high school. ""At all points in time, teachers rated the students who reported the lowest frequency of dating as having the best study skills and the students with the highest dating as having the worst study skills,"" according to the journal article. Study skills refer to behaviors that lead to academic success such as doing work for extra credit being well organized, finishing homework, working hard and reading assigned chapters. ""Dating a classmate may have the same emotional complications of dating a co-worker,"" Orpinas said, ""When the couple break up, they have to continue to see each other in class and perhaps witness the ex-partner dating someone else. It is reasonable to think this could be linked to depression and divert attention from studying."" ""Dating should not be considered a ceremony of growth in middle school,"" Orpinas concluded."

A standard treatment for depression includes all the following ways EXCEPT _ .	"Researchers invited 79 people between the ages of 18 and 50 years old who had been diagnosed with depression. 33 of the participants were offered 20 music therapy sessions, in addition to their usual treatment for depression. The other 46 participants received stan dard treatment, and acted as the control group. The one-on-one music therapy sessions each lasted 60 minutes and took place twice a week. Trained music therapists helped each participant to improvise music. On average, each participant attended 18 music therapy sessions. 29 individuals (88 percent) attended at least 15 sessions. The participants in both groups were followed up at three and six months and assessed forsymptoms of depression and anxiety. In the final analysis, researchers discovered that af ter three months of participation, individuals who received music therapy showed greatly fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and scored better on general functioning. Although improvements still remained after six months, the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant. Co-researcher Christian Gold, Ph.D., explained the study findings: ""Our trial has shown that music therapy, when added to standard care including medication, psychotherapy and counseling , helps people to improve their levels of depression and anxiety. Music therapy has specific qualities that allow people to express themselves and interact in a non-verbal way - even when they cannot find the words to describe their inner experiences."" Given the success of the study, researchers say it needs to be repeated with a larger sample of people, and that further research is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of such therapy. Outside experts believe this study shows that music ther apy is an effective addition to traditional therapy and improves outcomes. Mike Crawford, M.D., said, ""This is a high-quality randomized trial of music therapy specifically for depression, and the results suggest that it can improve the mood and general functioning of people with depression."""

What did people think of girls who got tattooed in the past?	Every girl wants to have a great-looking tattoo design that makes them more attractive. Small and lovely tattoo designs are the path to go for girls planning to get tattooed for the first time. Nowadays, more and more females are getting a tattoo inked on their body. In the last fifteen years, tattoos have grown from being a sign of rebelliousness and trouble to a state of popular acceptance as a mark of fashion. Tattoos are permanent so you need to be sure that you like it before getting one. A great way is to have small tattoos that look beautiful as well. You can get a cherry blossom tattoo on the foot, perhaps, a hibiscus flower on the shoulder or a lovely butterfly on the lower stomach; whatever design you choose, it can definitely add to your attractiveness and charm. Deciding to get a tattoo needs careful thought and reflection. Otherwise, you could make some serious tattoo mistakes. Try to avoid big and obvious designs if possible. Another important part of choosing a tattoo design is the location. What part of the body do you want it on? Choosing a hidden location can often make the tattoo the perfect adornment . As for professional women, tattoos should normally be where they can be hidden. Most importantly, no matter what tattoo design you choose the final goal is that the design should be something you like. If you are into the tattoo and really feel passionate about it you will carry yourself in a different manner when you get it inked on your body.	['They thought these girls were rebellious']
According to the passage,which part can help build up your confidence?	Tests can be stressful even for the most prepared students,and,unfortunately,test anxiety can actually have a negative impact on your performance.(Just having that knowledge adds to the stress,doesn't it?)Well,the following tips can help you get through your next test with much greater ease--and likely more success! Get Enough Sleep Getting 6 hours of less can put you into what's called a sleep deficit,or lack of sufficient sleep,which can actually make you less sharp mentally and thus negatively affect your performance on tests,even if you spent those missed hours of sleep studying.So it's very important for you to get all of your studying done so you can get a good night of sleep before your big day. Study Smarter Being organized with your studies can help you keep from pulling all-nighters to get all of your studying in and blowing the test because you're exhausted.How do you study 'smarter'? Make a list of the most important things you need to learn,in order of importance,and hit the items at the top of the list first.That way,if you run out of time,you're mostly covered.Make a list of all the work you have to do,estimate how much time each item will take,and compare that with the amount of hours you have available;this will tell you if you can carefully read or just skim,how many times you can afford to revise papers,and other ways to pace yourself so you can get everything done.If you're pressed for time,it's important to learn to let go of being perfect.Oh,and turn off the TV as much as possible until your tests are behind you. Visualize Success Before you fall asleep each night,it is a great way to visualize yourself taking the tests and doing wonderfully.Detailed visualizations can help you feel like you're really experiencing something,and visualizing yourself doing well is a way to 'practice' success in a way that can actually help you perform better and feel confident.Being confident as you take your exams can keep you from choking because of the stress.Visualizations can also help you to remember facts: you can create detailed scenarios that involve the information you're trying to remember,and this can help cement the facts in your memory. Stay Calm Because stress can impair your memory,it's important to stay calm before and during tests.While that's easier said than done,there are several stress relief techniques that can help you calm down quickly whenever you feel overwhelmed.For example,breathing exercise has been shown by research to reduce test anxiety,and can be extremely effective in helping you relax and reverse your stress response in a variety of situations: just take deep breaths,expanding your belly on the inhale,and let the stress come out with your exhales.

The driver wrote a short note and stuck it on the window because _ .	"A driver stopped his car on a street side to have a rest.As he lay down in the seat and closed his eyes, a person came up and knocked at the window to ask the time. The driver opened his eyes and looked at his watch. ""It's five past eight."" he said. Then he went to sleep again. But soon he was waken up again because a second person was knocking at the window.""Excuse me, what time is it now?""he asked. The driver looked at his watch again, and told him it was half past eight. In this way, the driver thought he couldn't have a good rest, so he wrote a short note and stuck it on the window for all to see. It said,""I don't know the time.""Again, he lay down in the seat for his sleep. A few minutes later,a third person came and began to knock at the window, ""Hey, sir.""he said, ""It's a quarter to nine."""	"[""he didn't want anybody to trouble him.""]"
New rules for pubs and clubs will be introduced in Britain to ban heavy drinking because _ .	"Tough new rules for pubs and clubs - including a ban on drinking games like the infamous ""dentist's chair"" - will be introduced in Britain this year in a bid to prevent the heavy drinking culture that costs the country billions of pounds a year. Other promotions like ""all you can drink for 10 pounds"", speed drinking competitions and ""women drink free"" nights will also be forbidden. But on the other hand, a large amount of offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets - widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and excessive drinking - will not be affected. Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation of minimum price controls on alcohol. Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he did not want to target responsible drinkers on low incomes, but that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking. ""These practices have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out."" he said. The ""dentist's chair"", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne. That game and others that promote mass consumption will be banned from April and publicans will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers. A second set of rules enforcing compulsory ID checks and making sure smaller alcoholic measures are on sale will come into effect in October. The government says excessive drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new rule will face severe punishment. Publicans and vendors could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds or face six months in prison."	['drinking in the country costs too much']

What's the passage mainly about?	"Microsoft founder Bill Gates has talked about to be a good parent, saying that 13 is a right age for a child's first mobile phone. The 57-year-old father of three said on the Today show that his children Jennifer and Rory were not allowed phones until their thirteen birthday and his youngest daughter Phoebe is still waiting for one. ""We've made a rule in our family that it's 13 when you get a phone.""

It is said that their kids have to do housework at home after school and aren't given much pocket money. And in 2010Mr Gates said that he wanted to give most of his $61 billion away rather than hand it down. ""That wouldn't be good either for my kids or society,"" he said. Mr Gates left Microsoft in 2008 to put his heart to charity. During the Today interview with host Matt Lauer, he said that helping others made him feel happy as creating software. "" What you really feel is what you've achieved. If a piece of software gets out there and lots of people love it--it lets them get their work down in better ways--that's exciting."" he replied."

What is the author's attitude towards taking selfies according to the passage?	"The smart phones that can take self-portraits or selfies have set us free. We can now document every moment of our life and instantly share it with the world through the Internet. However, some believe that it's also causing people to take unnecessary risks that sometimes prove to be deadly! According to recent reports, the desire to take a breathtaking selfie has killed 12 people. Though that may not seem like a lot, it's 50% more than the death from shark attacks. While the issues have been known for a while, they came to a head on September 21st, following the accidental death of Hideto Ueda at the Taj Mahal. It turns out that the 66-year-old Japanese and his companion were trying to take a selfie with the Royal Gate as the background when they fell down some stairs. While the friend escaped with a broken leg, Ueda was not as fortunate. He suffered a head injury and died soon after. Other fatal accidents include a 21-year-old Russian woman who fell off a bridge while trying to capture an exciting self-portrait. Three Indian students suffered a similar fate after they were run over by a train while taking a selfie on the railway tracks. The rising number of injuries is forcing officials to take measures. Russia has begun a nationwide awareness program to make its young citizens aware of the dangers of this safe hobby. The campaign's slogan is:""Even a million 'likes' on social media are not worth your life and well-being."" Though no other country has followed their lead, many are banning the selfie stick! In the last few months many museums, and theme parks including Disney, have banned its use. JR West became the first institution worldwide to ban the sticks both inside Japan's bullet trains as well as out on the railway platforms. While these measures may help reduce the incidents, the only way to stop selfie-related injuries and deaths is to take responsibility -- not just for themselves but their friends. So next time you decide to take a selfie that appears a little risky, be sure to stop and ask yourself -- is it worth it?"	['Cautious.']
What's the writer's purpose of mentioning Denmark's literature?	"Hans Christian Andersen put Denmark on the map of the world literature with his stories The Emperor's New Clothes,The Little MermaidandThe Ugly Duckling. Now Copenhagen, the country's capital, has become the center of the world political map, with 190 world leaders attending the climate talks there, not to mention thousands of reporters. Just how much do you know about the Scandinavian country? Denmark is famous for its design culture. At the heart of ""Danish Design"" is the idea that, as poet and designer Piet Hein puts it: ""There is one art, not more, nor less, [and that is] to do all things with artlessness ."" Danish design places equal emphasis on practicality and quality. From Lego toys to furniture, Danish products are known for their clean lines, simplicity and functionality. ""Remove material where it's not needed. Keep things simple and functional and make them carefully,"" explained Hans J. Wegner, the first Danish designer to achieve worldwide fame: ""The aim is not to create a work of art, but to produce a good chair."" ""The Danes have done a better job than most in promoting arts in Europe, considering their country's size and population, in the fields of architecture, sculpture and design,"" writes Helena Smith, reporter with British newspaper the Guardian. The simplicity of Danish design may extend to the quality of life there. Some even claim that the Danes have the highest quality of life of any nation in the world. Kate Vial, a 55-year-old American who has lived and worked in Denmark for more than 30 years, explaining why she chooses to live in Denmark rather than the US, told Germany's biggest news weekly Der Spiegel: ""I just chose a simpler lifestyle, one where I could ride my bike all over and where I don't have to make a great living to survive."""

Why do officials worry that people in northern Nigeria may fear the vaccine once again?	A nurse prepares a polio vaccination for a baby in the Otash refugee camp in South Darfur. United Nations and Sudanese agencies will carry out the campaign this week and again in November. Sudan had been polio-free since two thousand and five. The new case of wild polio virus was _ last month in South Darfur. Health officials also announced last month that Nigeria has had almost seventy new cases of polio since two thousand and five. Those cases, however, were caused by the polio vaccine itself. There are two kinds of polio vaccine . The one given by injection contains killed virus, which cannot cause polio. The one given by mouth contains live but weakened virus. In very rare cases the virus can change and cause polio. The way to stop the spread now is more vaccinations. But officials worry that people in northern Nigeria may, once again, fear the vaccine. In recent years, local leaders spread stories that Western nations had poisoned the vaccine with the virus that causes AIDS. The United States Food and Drug Administration had told parents not to give them to children under age two unless a doctor says to use them. The F.D.A. gave the advice as it announced a meeting of experts to discuss cold medicines for children. That advisory committee met last week -- and voted that these drugs should not be given to children under the age of six. Members said there is not enough evidence to show that these drugs work in children. They called for more research. The committee also said that liquid medicines should all use the same measurement terms. This could reduce the risk of parents giving their children too much. _ The drug industry says its products are safe and effective for children. But it says parents need to be better educated about how to use them. A week before the meeting, the industry decided to end sales of cold products for children under two.

The best title of this passage might be_.	"How can you find out what is going on inside a person's body without opening the patient's body up? Regular X rays can show a lot. CAT scans can show even more. They can give a complete view of body organs. What is a CAT scan? CAT stands for a kind of machine. It is a special X-ray machine that gets a 360-degree picture of a small area of a patient's body. Doctors use X rays to study and determine diseases and injuries within the body, X rays can find a foreign object inside the body or take pictures of some inside organs to be X-rayed. A CAT scanner, however, uses a group of X rays to give a cross-sectional view of a specific part of the body. A fine group of X rays is scanned across the body and around the patient from many different directions. A computer studies the information from each direction and produces a clear cross-sectional picture on a screen. This picture is then photographed for later use. Several cross sections, taken one after another, can give clear ""photos"" of the entire body or of any body organs. The latest CAT scanners can even give clear pictures of active, moving organs, just as a fast-action camera can ""stop the action"", giving clear pictures of what appears unclear to the eye. And because of the 360-degree pictures, CAT scans show clear and complete views of organs in a manner that was once only shown during operation or examination of a dead patient. Frequent appearance before X rays can cause skin burns, cancer or other damage to the body. Yet CAT scans actually don't cause the patient to more radiation than regular X rays do. CAT scans can also be done without getting something harmful into the patient, so they are less risky than regular X rays. CAT scans provide exact, detailed information. They can quickly find such a thing as bleeding inside the brain. They are helping to save lives."	['New X-ray Machine to Save Lives']
I feel that apples taste a little sweeter than before because _ .	"One afternoon, my son came home from school and asked me, ""Are all people the same even if their skin color is different?"" I thought for a moment, then I said, ""I'll explain. Let's go to a fruit store first. I have something interesting to show you."" At the store, I told him that we needed to buy apples. And we bought some red apples, green apples and yellow apples. After we got home, I told Adam, ""It's time to answer your question."" I put one of each type of apple on the table: first a red apple, followed by a green apple and then a yellow apple. Then I looked at Adam, who was sitting on the other side of the table. ""Adam, people are just like apples. They come in different colors, shapes and sizes. See, some may not even look as delicious as others."" As I was talking, Adam was examining each one carefully. Then, I took each of the apples and peeled them, placing them back on the table, but in a different place. ""OK, Adam, tell me which one is the red apple, the green apple and the yellow apple."" He said, ""I can't tell. They all look the same now."" ""Take a bite of each one. See if that helps you tell which one is which."" He took big bites, and then a huge smile came across his face. ""People are just like apples! They are all different, but if you take off the outside, they're pretty much the same on the inside."" ""Right,"" I agreed. ""Just like everyone has their own features but they are nearly the same."" He completely got it. I didn't need to say or do anything else.

What can we infer from the text?	"By the mid-nineteenth century, the term ""icebox"" had entered the American language, but ice was still only beginning to affect the diet of ordinary citizens in the United States. The ice trade grew with the growth of cities. Ice was used in hotels, taverns , and hospitals, and by some forward-looking city dealers in fresh meat, fresh fish, and butter. After the Civil War (1861-1865), as ice was used to refrigerate freight cars, it also came into household use. Even before 1880, half of the ice sold in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and one-third of that sold in Boston and Chicago, went to families for their own use. This had become possible because a new household convenience, the icebox, a precursor of the modern fridge, had been invented. Making an efficient icebox as not as easy as we might now suppose. In the early nineteenth century, the knowledge of the physics of heat, which was essential to a science of refrigeration, was rudimentary . The commonsense notion that the best icebox was one that prevented the ice from melting was of course mistaken, for it was the melting of the ice that performed the cooling. Nevertheless, early efforts to economize ice included wrapping up the ice in blankets, which kept the ice from doing its job. Not until near the end of the nineteenth century did inventors achieve the delicate balance of insulation and circulation needed for an efficient icebox. But as early as 1803, and ingenious Maryland farmer, Thomas Moore, had been on the right track. He owned a farm about twenty miles outside the city of Washington, for which the village of Georgetown was the market center. When he used an icebox of his own design to transport his butter to market, he found that customers would pass up the rapidly melting stuff in the tubs of his competitors to pay a premium price for his butter, still fresh and hard in neat, one-pound bricks. One advantage of his icebox, Moore explained, was that farmers would no longer have to travel to market at night in order to keep their produce cool."	['Knowledge of the physics of heat plays an important part in inventing a good icebox']
Which of the following prevents mums from achieving their goals?	"The struggle to ""have it all"" leaves many mothers giving up their health and hobbies. But dads have more time to spare according to a research, with just 55 per cent saying they lose sleep and regular exercise compared with 71 percent of mums. Twice as many mothers as fathers complained that they did not spend enough time relaxing, with almost half of mums spending less than two hours a week with friends. And more than a third miss out on hobbies and interests because they are too busy. In spite of changing roles in the family, women are still responsible for most of the child care. Nearly a third spend more than 10 hours a week caring for their children, compared with just one in ten fathers. More mums than dads also say housework and tiredness stop them achieving their goals. But the research also shows mums gain a sense of achievement from finishing the housework, getting their children to school on time or sitting down to a family dinner. The research underlines the fact that women feel under pressure to succeed in all areas of their lives. As Nick Booth, a marketing director put, ""They are pushing themselves too hard and are in danger of burning out. We'd encourage anyone to take time out for themselves. Having your own interests and hobbies and ensuring you get enough sleep is hugely important. Other parts of your life, including work and family life, improve as a result."" The Olympian and mother Jo Pavey admitted balancing career, family and personal time can be a struggle. Jo, 41, became the oldest female gold medalist at the European Championship last year - but regards her children as her biggest achievement. The mum of two said,""When I was younger,I'd have probably said it wasn't possible to have a sporting career and be mum. But actually it is all about striking a balance and looking after yourself."""

Mr. Henry thought that _ .	"One day, Anna was about to walk into her office, when the headmaster, Mr. Henry stopped her. ""Now,"" he said, ""I want you to tell me the truth, my dear."" ""Naturally,"" said Anna shortly, fearing that something terrible had happened. ""I have had a most serious accusation made against you by Mrs. Bond."" ""Mrs. Bond?"" said Anna, not understanding. Janet Bond was a quiet, little mouse of a child. As far as Anna could remember,she had never had cause to speak an angry word to the girl. ""Mrs. Bond,"" went on Mr. Henry, ""tells me that you scolded her daughter yesterday afternoon."" ""Scolded?"" cried Anna. ""I don't scold. At least not in school,"" she added honestly. ""Mrs. Bond's story is that Janet was a little late back to school in the afternoon. She said that the child had to spend some time in the bathroom, which meant she set out from home a little late."" ""Just a minute,"" said Anna, beginning to understand. ""She did come late, very late. I had marked her absent, of course. Then she wandered in, when we'd started our paper--cutting, and I believe I said she was a nuisance . She didn't appear to hear, and was certainly quite cheerful."" ""Ah, a nuisance."" Mr. Henry jumped on the word. ""You're sure you only said a nuisance."" ""I may not even have said that,"" Anna replied. ""It was no more than slight displeasure that I felt and I certainly didn't scold.""? ""Mrs. Bond said that you called her child a blasted nuisance. Is that true?"" ""Indeed it isn't,"" said Anna, ""The child or the mother has made it up!"" Mr. Henry was satisfied with Anna's explanation. ""Just as I thought, my dear, but of course I had to make sure."""

What's the writer's attitude towards digital footprint?	Every time you go online you leave a digital footprint. This is just like a real footprint. It tells where you have been, how long you stayed on line and what you have been doing there. It's easy to get the information and show your digital footprint every time when you send an email, messages and photos. You shouldn't worry about it too much but it is better to be careful about your digital footprint when you are online. There are five tips for taking care of your digital footprint. Don't forget to close the pages with your information when you leave a website, especially if you are using a shared computer. Don't tell anyone your password and don't write them down in a place that everybody can see. Make them more difficult by using both letters and numbers. Remember your favourite websites by looking over the history and the bookmark on your computer or your mobile phone. This is a way that your digital footprint can work in your favour, remember to clear your history from time to time. If you want to post some words on line, you don't have to use your own name. You can use a nickname instead. You can also use a picture instead of a real photo. Protect your personal information online. Be careful about who you share your own information with and always think twice before sharing email, home address, school or phone number with someone. All kinds of people are interested in your digital footprint. It's now quite common for people to look over some personal information online before they offer someone a job. There are cases of people having missed out on jobs and places because their digital footprint didn't make them look good. So remember: keep safe, don't put too much personal information online and always think carefully before you post something. Ask yourself, 'would I be happy for everyone to see this?'	['We should not use our own names online.']
The writer thinks that _ .	The use of the word imitation reminds me that we ought to make some more comments on the risk of people imitating what they see on the screen in the way of crime or violence. First there was always a risk of children acting out scenes which could be dangerous. For example, I remember a woman who was head of a middle school telling me that she had happened to look out of her window when the children were on the playground and had seen them putting a small boy on a chair with a rope round his neck and the rope over the branch of a tree; fortunately she was in time to get there before the child was hanged. I remember a film in particular in which the hero who was imprisoned had escaped by electrocuting his guard, the technique of doing this being shown in detail. This was the kind of scene which we could cut for these reasons. In films for young people and adults we always tried to keep off the screen the details of criminal techniques, such as how to open a locked door with a piece of hard plastic or how to open a safe; if we were consulted before production, I used to advise that the details should not be shown. When I gave talks in prisons about film checking I had full support for this, since fathers who were in prison for criminal offences did not want their children to get on crime. Every time I gave a talk in a prison someone used to mention the French film Rififi. made by Jules Dassin in 1954. This remarkable film showed in great detail a robbery of a jeweler's shop, the robbery lasting about half an hour and being backed by only natural sound...one of the most brilliant film sequences of all time. I remember our discussion at the time. We thought that the robbery was finished only with the use of advanced and obviously expensive equipment and that only the most experienced and skilled criminals could possibly imitate it; we believed therefore that it was ly safe. When talking in prisons some years later I learned that there had been several robberies in which the techniques had been copied, so perhaps we were wrong.

How did Yuuki save the villagers from the disaster?	"For hundreds of years, Japan has been hit, from time to time, by tsunamis , which are caused by earthquakes or underwater volcanoes. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster. Yuuki lived with his family in a seaside village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, Yuuki felt a small earthquake but it was not strong enough to frighten anybody. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide areas of beach that had never been seen before. Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the new beach land. But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand. Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the harvested rice. Then he called out, ""Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!"" When everyone reached the mountain top, a villager cried out, ""Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire."" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers screamed at him. Just then, someone shouted, ""Look!"" In the distance a huge dark wave of water was speeding towards the shore. When it hit the shore, it destroyed everything. On the mountain everyone stared at the village ruins in terror. ""I'm sorry I burned the fields,"" said Yuuki, his voice trembling. ""Yuuki,"" the village chief answered. ""You saved us all."" The villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. ""We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,"" said one, ""but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!"""	['He set fire to the rice field.']
Before World War I, the tango spread to _ .	Argentina in the late nineteenth century was an exciting place. Around 1870,it was experiencing an economic boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn't pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango came into being. At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women the men, so if a man didn't want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women. Gradually, the dance spread into the upper classes of Argentinean society and became more respectable. In Europe at this time, strong interest in dance from around the world was beginning. This interest in international dance was especially evident in Paris. Every kind of dance from ballet to belly dancing could be found on the stages of the Paris theaters of the Paris theaters. After tango dances from Argentina arrive in Europe, they began to draw the interest of the public as they performed their exciting dance in cafes. Though not everyone approved of the new dance, saying it was a little too shocking, the dance did find enough supporters to make it popular. The popularity of the tango continued to grow in many other parts of the world. Soldiers who returned to the United States from World War I brought the tango to North America. It reached Japan in 1926, and in 2003 the Argentinean embassy in Seoul hired a local tango dancer to act an a kind of dance ambassador, and promote tango dancing throughout South Korea.	['France.']
After the earthquake, all of the following occurred EXCEPT that _ .	"The City of Christchurch, New Zealand was struck by a 7.1magnitude earthquake on the early morning of Saturday, September 4, 2010. No tsunami alert was reported. The country's army troops were on standby to assist victims and disaster recovery operation. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key, flew to the affected area to inspect and assess the situation of the damaged city. The Prime Minister said that the full assessment of the damages would possibly take months to know the severity of damages. Based from his assessment on what he saw in the area, it could cost at least 2 billion New Zealand dollars or US$1.4 billion for reconstruction. ""An absolute miracle that no one died,"" Prime Minister John Key said. Two were seriously injured from this quake and thousands of local residents were awakened after being shaken at 4:35 a.m. of that Saturday. There were people trapped inside the damaged buildings but fortunately none were reported dead from the rubble of the damaged buildings. ""We're all feeling scared--we've just had some significant aftershocks,"" a survivor told TV One News. ""Tonight we're just people in the face of a massive natural disaster, trying to help each other and we're grateful we haven't lost a life."" GNS Science reported 29 aftershocks within the 14 hours after the quake, with strength from magnitude 3.7 to 5.4. _ . The country experiences more than 14,000 earthquakes a year--but only about 150 are felt by people. ""Many buildings here were built with earthquake protection measure. However, in most cities in developing countries, people build how they want to and there're no building controls to force them to build to a higher standard that's safe,"" Andrew Charleson, an architecture professor at Victoria University of Wellington told CNN."

The ceremonies of Coming of Age Day for 20 dated back to _ .	Coming of Age Day is a Japanese holiday held on the second Monday of January. It is held in order to help all those who are 20 or over realize that they have become independent members of society. Coming of age ceremonies have been held since the ancient times in Japan. In the past, boys marked their change to adulthood when they were around 15, and girls celebrated their coming of age when they turned 13 or so. It wasn't until 1876 that 20 became the legal age of adulthood. These days, many women choose to wear traditional clothing---a kind of kimono with special designs. For unmarried women, this type of kimono is the most formal thing they can wear. However, such a full set of formal clothing is expensive, so it is usually either passed down or rented rather than being bought specially for the occasion. Men may also wear traditional clothing. Local city governments host special coming of age ceremonies for 20-year-olds. They gain the right to vote on their twentieth birthday and have new responsibilities as well. So the age of 20 is a big turning point for the Japanese. All young adults who turned or will turn 20 between April 1 of the previous year and March 31 of the current one and who maintain residency in the area are invited to attend. Government officials give speeches, and small presents are handed out to the new adults during the ceremonies. After the ceremonies, the young adults often gather in groups and go to parties.

From the conversation between the author and the Mexican woman, we can infer that the woman _ .	"It is love that makes the world go round. And it is also love that has such power to overcome all difficulties. So we say: ""Love will find a way."" As smile is a facial expression showing pleasure, affection, and friendliness, it is the commonest way to show our good will perfectly without saying anything. A Chinese saying runs: ""never hit a person who is smiling at you."" It is a time-proven fact that the smile is a language all its own-- a universal language--understood by the people of every nation in the world. We may not speak the same tongue as our foreign neighbors, but we smile in the same tongue. We need no interpreter for thus expressing love, happiness, or good will. One day while shopping in a small town in southern California, it was my misfortune to be approached by a clerk whose personality contradicted mine. He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing, and marched angrily out of the store. My anger toward that grew with each step. Outside, standing at the corner, was a dark-complexion young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling smile covered his face. I gave in immediately. The magnetic power of that shining smile drove away all bitterness within me, and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding. ""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" I remarked, in passing. Then, suddenly something inside me sent me turning back. ""I really owe you a debt of gratitude,"" I said softly. His smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer. A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby. The woman stepped forward and eyed me inquiringly. ""Carlos, he no speak English,"" she volunteered. ""You want I should tell him something?"" In that moment I felt transformed. Carlos' smile had made a big person of me. My friendliness and good will toward all mankind stood ten feet tall. ""Yes,"" my reply was enthusiastic and sincere, ""tell him I said 'Thank you!'"" ""Thank you?"" The woman seemed slightly puzzled. I gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave. ""Just tell him that,"" I insisted. ""He'll understand. I am sure!"" Oh, what a smile can do! Although I have never seen that young man again, I shall never forget the lesson he taught me that morning. From that day on, I became smile - conscious, and I practice that diligently, anywhere and everywhere, with everybody. When I got excited in traffic, taking the right-of-way from the other car with my stupid mistake, I'd smile and shrug my shoulders apologetically. This action on my part would always draw a good-natured smile in return. If the other fellow was at fault - and if I could remember my resolution in time! - he'd get a broad smile of understanding. This took a bit of doing at first. I'll admit it wasn't always easy, but it was fun. The results were sometimes amazing. Many times, a broad, friendly smile would completely turn aside ill-feeling and tension. I'm wondering now how many tragic accidents could be avoided on our overcrowded highways, if every driver remembered to smile!"	['knew some English and was ready to help others']

Which statement about the spread of loneliness is true?	A newly-published study has shown that loneliness can spread from one person to another, like a disease. Researchers used information from the Framingham Study, which began in 1948. The Framingham Study gathers information about physical and mental health, personal behavior and diet. At first, the study involved about 5,000 people in the American state of Massachusetts. Now, more than 12,000 individuals are taking part. Information from the Framingham Study showed earlier that happiness can spread from person to person. So can behaviors like littering and the ability to stop smoking. University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo led the recent study. He and other researchers attempted to show how often people felt lonely. They found that the feeling of loneliness spread through social groups. Having a social connection with a lonely person increased the chances that another individual would feel lonely. In fact, a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness. A friend of that person was 25% more likely. The researchers say this shows that a person could indirectly be affected by someone's loneliness. The effect was strongest among friends. Neighbors were the second most affected group. The effect was weaker on husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. The researchers also found that loneliness spread more easily among women than men. The New York Times newspaper reports that, on average, people experience feelings of loneliness about 48 days a year. It also found that every additional friend can decrease loneliness by about five percent, or two and a half fewer lonely days. Loneliness has been linked to health problems like depression and sleeping difficulties. The researchers believe that knowing the causes of loneliness could help in reducing it. The study suggests that people can take steps to stop the spread of loneliness. They can do this by helping individuals they know who may be experiencing loneliness. The result can be helpful to the whole social group.	['Women are more likely to be affected than men.']
What's the most difficult in making friends with neighbors?	If you have no friends around you, it's time that you should know about your neighborhood. Not all of your neighbors out there are friendly, but at least you need to communicate with them. It is common that when you are new to the neighborhood, your neighbors might actually greet you in an inspiring way. In other words, they are pleased to welcome you in their neighbor-hood. Both you and your neighbors may start in getting known to each other by introducing yourselves. This is a sign that you and your neighbors are actually friends. Instead of watching television and playing computer games all the time, you also need to take a break and have some fun talking with your neighbors. But if you want to make friends with them, you need to do something that might please them. The only problem for this situation is that you are afraid to approach and greet them in a nice way. This is a challenge that you or your fellow neighbors must be aware of. You need to get as many friends as possible in your neighborhood, and one of them is to get closer with the unfriendly. If you want to get closer with him but he refuses to be friends with you, don't force him anymore. Treat him with some respect if you don't like to create any more problems. However, if he agrees to be your friend, you are lucky and start treating him like a friend. It is very tough to approach a person in your neighborhood, but it is a good challenge. This is how important for you to get closer with your neighbors, even if they're unfriendly. This is better than sticking yourself alone at home and not having time for social interactions with real people.	['Getting close with the unfriendly neighbors.']
What can be inferred from Sidney's words in the passage?	"""Tom!"" There was no answer. ""Tom!"" Still no answer. ""Where's that boy gone? Tom!"" The old lady looked all around the room. She looked under the bed, but found only the cat. ""If I catch that boy, ..."" she murmured to herself. She opened the door and looked out into the garden. ""Tom!"" she shouted. Then she heard a slight noise behind her. She turned round just in time to catch the boy as he came out of a cupboard. ""And what have you been doing in there?"" ""Nothing,"" said the boy. ""Nothing! Look at your hands and your mouth! What is that stuff?"" ""I don't know, Aunt."" ""Well, I know. It's a jam. I've told you forty times that if you touched that jam, I'd _ you. Give me that stick."" ""Look out, Aunt! Look behind you!"" The old lady turned round and Tom was out of the door in a flash, over the garden fence and away. ""Damn that boy! Will I never learn? He's always playing tricks on me. And he seems to know just now how far he can go, too. But I can't take a stick to him. I really can't. After all, he's my dead sister's boy. Ah well, he'll play truant today and I'll have to make him work tomorrow."" At supper Aunt Polly tried to trick Tom into admitting that he hadn't gone to school. ""It was rather hot today, wasn't it, Tom?"" ""Yes,"" answered Tom. ""You didn't have to open your shirt collar where I sewed it, then."" Tom was confident, now. He opened his jacket. His collar was securely sewed. ""Oh Tom,"" said Aunt Polly. ""You're a good boy really."" She was sorry that she had been wrong about him. ""But Aunt,"" came a voice. It was Sidney, Tom's younger brother. ""Didn' t you sew Tom's collar with white cotton? Look! Now it's black. Tom was already running out of the door. ---The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain"	"[""Tom didn't go to school that day.""]"
What is NOT explained in the passage?	"A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits ""raised area"" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months."	['Why do birds travel in winter?']
Who was the owner of the earring lost on the bus according go the passage?	"Around twenty years ago I was going through hard times. I could not find a satisfying job. To my shame, I had to drive a school bus to make ends meet and lived in a friend's house. One afternoon, while driving through a quiet suburban neighborhood I was so sad that I kept asking myself ""Why has my life become so hard?"" ""What's wrong with the world?"" Then I pulled over the bus to drop off a little girl and as she passed she handed me a pretty earring, saying she found it on the floor of the bus and I should keep it in case the owner came to look for it. In the evening, the owner did come to look for her earring. When I handed it to her, she got very excited and continued saying ""Thanks, you're a real gentleman."" I told her that she should thank the little girl who had found it. She said, ""Yes, and you are a good driver, too. What a lovely world it is!"" Then she left with satisfaction. I was touched by her last words. I had thought something was wrong with the world just because of my poor condition. In fact, nothing was wrong with the world. I should change my attitude towards life. I should be positive about life. At first it was hard, and then it got easier. Every day I could find things to make me happy. Then one night there was a phone call for me at my friend's house from a lady who was a manager in a large hospital. She said she had read my application form and asked me if I would like to work in the hospital. I said yes and got the job. Looking back at the experience I know the most important is to have a positive attitude towards life."	['Not mentioned']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage.	When the world was very young, people lived in hot places .They didn't live in cold places because they could not keep warm there. At first men didn't know how to make a fire. Sometimes trees were hit by lightning .Then a fire was started .People took some of the fire near their homes. A fire was very important for three reasons. It kept them warm. Wild animals were frightened when they saw it. And when food was cooked, it tasted much better. But men didn't know how to make a fire. When they had a fire, they didn't let it stop burning. If it went out, they couldn't start it again. They had to wait for lightning to start another fire. Sometimes they had to wait for years. Later, they learned how to make a fire. But it was not easy to make something burn . Now we have matches. We can carry them in our pockets and make a fire when we want to.	['After man knew how to make a fire, it became very easy to burn something .']
According to the passage, which kind of bike is least likely to be stolen?	Jumping on your bike, even in the city, is becoming increasingly popular--- in London, for example, cycle use has more than doubled in the past ten years. So, which is the best bike for you? If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure . For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous. Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300. A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350. For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500. Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards aren't always included.	['A folding bike.']
Which is NOT right according to the passage?	Why are first ladies so important in the United States? They are unpaid and have no official work? There are several reasons, but the most important reason is that they are role models for other women in the United States. Jacqueline Kennedy was the best first lady in the US. Although she wasn't an actress, model or singer, she was a fashion and cultural icon who charmed people wherever she went. If you are looking for someone who is as charming as Jacqueline Kennedy, it will be hard to find anyone more suitable than Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping. If you were writing a novel and trying to describe the perfect mixture of personal history, capabilities, confident lady for a character, you'd come up with someone like Peng. Born into a family in Shandong province, she joined the People's Liberation Army at the age of 18, doing pretty well in singing military songs. But she is not only famous for her voice and great achievements, but also for her charity efforts. She has, among other things, worked as a member of World Health Organization to fight against AIDS, and has done much for 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The media reported Peng's trip with her husband. This was Xi's first foreign trip as president. The trip shows that she can be a role model for Chinese women, especially young Chinese women at home and abroad. In the past, China has not had a tradition of first ladies like in the US. Now that China has a higher position on the world stage, it can have its first first lady! And Peng Liyuan is the perfect person with whom to begin.	['Peng Liyuan wrote military songs from the age of 18.']
It can be inferred from the passage that_.	During my first two months in China, I was like a girl in love. Everything I saw and did amazed me. I have journal entries that are pages long describing, in great detail, everything I ate. From the sauce to the kind of chopsticks I used, nothing went unnoticed or unrecorded. Chinese people gape at me when they see me using chopsticks, just because I can. Western eating is so different, not only in the use of cutlery , but also in the rules of eating, for which there are many. For example, everything is cut before it's eaten, except salad. Instead of eating around the bone, as we do here (I do it too, of course), people cut around the bones, which makes eating fish a difficult thing. Also, there is a certain way to eat soup, which involves pushing the spoon away from you, to make sure you don't get splashed, and never slurping or touching your teeth on the spoon. Before I came here, I thought table manners were very important. Now I think that they are silly, worrying and concentrating on changing the fork and knife every time you cut your food takes away from the enjoyment of food. Every time I eat at a restaurant, I try something new. I am not afraid of trying anything and I will eat anything once. At first I would try a bite and not like it. This happened with fish heads, snake, anything spicy, and bitter melon, to name a few. Now I like all of these things. My new favorite dish is spicy fish heads. There are vegetables whose names I don't know in English. I am proficient in Chinese food, and am also at least ten pounds heavier than when I first arrived. I never even like rice before I came here, and now I have it with every meal. I don't like cheese either, and Western food just doesn't taste as good as it once did. Even McDonald's is better here.

Which of the following statements best proves that Horie's latest voyage was meaningful?	"Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. ""When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,"" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, ""Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power."" Horie told the reporter, ""I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact."""	['His voyage had the theme of protecting the environment.']

Who wrote the story?	One day a few years ago a very funny thing happened to a neighbor of mine. He is a teacher at one of London's big medical schools, He had finished his teaching for the summer term and was at the airport on his way to Russia to give a lecture. He had put a few clothes and his lecture notes in his shoulder bag, but he had put Rupert, the skeleton to be used in his lecture, in a large brown suitcase . At the airport desk, he suddenly thought that he had forgotten to buy a newspaper. He left his suitcase near the desk and went over to the shop. When he got back he discovered that someone had taken his suitcase by mistake. He often wonders what they said when they got home and found Rupert.	"[""The teacher's neighbour.""]"
What was the first impression that the boy gave the author?	I was fairly new to this particular school since my parents only moved to the area. There was a boy, who, as it turned out, was an orphan and was living and working for a small farming family. He didn't appear at first glance to ever be fully engaged in the school learning process;he would sit quietly, never seem to get any attention from the teacher, and would spend a lot of time staring out of the window just behind him. Over the next few weeks, I got to know this boy while playing outside in the schoolyard playing baseball, or soccer. He was very athletic and very good at anything we played. I started to wonder why he didn't seem to do well in school and why the teacher ignored him. He told me he had been in several foster homes since he was a little boy and that most of his time in the last few years had always been on farms. He said he was made to work before he went to school and as soon as he got home until it was time for bed. He was never given a chance to go out and play, nor was he allowed to have any friends although he told me he really didn't have any friends anyway, because he was an orphan and they did not want anything to do with him. I had never before been acquainted with prejudice of any kind. Here was one characteristic of a human being who through no fault of his own carried a label that prevented him from even having friends as a child. His potential was also being ignored by the teacher. It wasn't that he couldn't learn, or didn't want to -- it was because he wasn't encouraged or in some cases, allowed to. We may all meet people through the years that we tend to apply labels to without really taking the time to get to know them, to discover their real potential because our vision is clouded by how we always put people into _ that we are used to or comfortable with.	['He was not drawn into learning.']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Using a computer or smartphone at night can cause us to pile on the pounds,new research has revealed. The study found a link between blue light exposure(blue light is produced by smartphones and computers)and increased hunger.It found that exposure to blue light increases hunger levels for several hours and even increases hunger levels after eating a meal.Blue light exposure has also already been shown to cause decreased sleepiness in the evening,increasing the risk of sleeplessness. The leading researcher,Ivy Cheung,from Northwestern University in Chicago,said,""A single three-hour exposure to blue-enriched light in the evening greatly affected hunger and metabolism .These results are important because they suggest that controlling environmental light exposure for humans may represent a _ approach of influencing food intake patterns and metabolism."" The study group consisted of 10 healthy adults with regular sleep and eating schedules. They completed a four-day trial under dim light conditions,which involved exposure to less than 20 lux(,)during 16 hours awake and less than 3 lux during eight hours of sleep.On the third day they were exposed to three hours of 260 lux,blue-enriched light starting10.5 hours after waking up.and the effects were compared with dim light exposure. Ivy Cheung said more research is needed to determine the functions involved in the relationship between light exposure,hunger and metabolism."	['The researchers drew their conclusion by comparison.']
By writing the passage, the author intends to _ .	"My mother has always instilled in me the importance of education. Education is essential. It will help me get accepted to college if I perform well academically and advance my opportunities for success in the future. Most jobs now require at least a high school diploma, and for many jobs, a college degree is preferred. It is important that all students have excellent educators in their life to help them achieve and have the opportunity to go to college, get a job, support themselves and their family, and impact the community. As we celebrate and honor all teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week, I've reflected on the impact my teachers have had, and will continue to have, in my life. From Mr. Bowker, who challenged me in math, to Mr. Bernsteen, my health teacher who taught me the value of hard work, my teachers have helped shape the student I am today. But one of the teachers who left a lasting impression on me was my summer school teacher, Mr. Davis, who impacted me beyond the classroom. He found time to connect with me on a personal level and talk to me after class. I felt like Mr. Davis cared about my academic success and was committed to setting an example of what's possible. Mr. Davis could relate to what it was like to be a rising ninth-grade black male in today's society. He taught me how to speak up confidently and share my ideas with others. He told me that I was brilliant and that when I spoke, the world should listen. And when I would put my hand down because I was unsure of my answer, Mr. Davis would immediately say, ""No _ , no glory."" He never made me feel inadequate; he encouraged me to always pursue knowledge because he, too, was learning every day. Mr. Davis helped me navigate the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities. I think having more black male teachers like Mr. Davis in the classroom could increase student success. They would share the background and experiences of many of their students and help build long-lasting teacher/student relationships. But, unfortunately, the likelihood that students of color in Nevada will have a teacher that looks like them is one of the lowest in the country. As the student population becomes more ethnically diverse, teachers in Nevada still are predominantly white. According to a 2012 Education Week report, in the Clark County School District, nearly 70 percent of students identified as students of color, but 76 percent of teachers were white. The numbers for black male teachers are more discouraging. Just 2 percent of teachers nationwide are black men. But you can help change the numbers. Whether you decide to study education in college or graduate school, or apply to programs in Las Vegas such as Teach For America, I hope more black males will consider teaching as a career. My peers and I need more examples of excellence and success in classrooms--examples who look like us. You can be the model to impact our life and push us to achieve. You can ensure that, when we look to the front of the room, we can see a little bit of ourselves reflected back."	['appeal to more black males to be teachers']

Beginning college can be an exciting but awkward time. Follow these tips to adjust to your new life rapidly and make the most of your college experience. * To save time and money, use the college' s bus system. Taking the bus to school is quick, easy and free in most college towns. You won' t have to locate or afford a place to park either. It' s also a good way to be environmentally aware. * Save pennies on books by waiting until class starts. You might not even need all of the recommended books. New textbooks cost an arm and a leg. Try buying used textbooks -- it' s a surefire way to save money and serves the purpose as well. * Do never look at college life as an endless series of parties and social activities. But there is a whole lot more to college if you're serious about graduating. Having a good college experience is all about balancing work and fun. * Be mindful of your diet. Make healthy food choices and watch what you eat. Avoid foods that are processed or high in sugar. The ""freshman 15""is real. Many college students gain at least 15 pounds during their freshmen year. * While electives can be helpful when figuring out your major, you shouldn't entirely rely on them. Clubs and other organizations exist around. Get involved. Make sure, though, that you still have time to study. Having too much on your plate can hurt your grades."

What would be the best title for the passage ?	Naturally ,American schoolchildren love holidays .And they get a lot of them each year .Besides having national holidays such as Thanksgiving and Presidents; Day off from school ,students get longer breaks in the US only go to school for about 180 days a year.To students ,holidays are perfect .However ,parents think there are advantages and disadvantages . On the one hand ,school holidays allow families to spend time together .Many American parents take time off from work during June,July or august to travel with their children on vacations either in the US or in a foreign country .On the other hand ,schoolchildren get much more time off school than parents get vacation for an time.This means that parents with young children may have to pay more in the babysitting or day care coats.As well ,the long summer holidays mean that students sometimes get bored. Besides going on trips with their parents ,American students enjoy taking part in different kind s of activities during the holidays .For example ,some kids enjoy summer camps and outdoor adventure holidays .Such trips are great adventurous students . _ also have a lot to offer students who aren't usually interested in traditional PE activities .ou can do courses in survival skills ,for example .Students learn how to make a camp in the forest ,which wild food they can eat and how to find their way to make a camp in the forest,which wild food they can eat and how to find their way back to the center.

For podcast, which is wrong?	"Every day we are bombarded with images, videos, music and news. In this age of visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a phenomenal comeback. ""We're at the dawn of a golden age of audio,"" said US-based podcaster Alex Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15 percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast. These statistics, released by Edison Research, reveal the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present day's digital podcast format. The term ""podcast,"" was coined in 2004, but the trend only started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. Since the leap in consumer demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast subscription rates have only accelerated. The appeal of the podcast partially resides in its multiplatform delivery and on-demand capabilities. You can tune in during those extra minutes of the day when you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content every week. Donna Jackson, 22, Sydney university media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTunes .""I listen while I'm pottering around the house doing something else. It makes completing a boring task a lot more enjoyable..... And it's an easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,"" she said. Unlike television and music, the audio format has the potential to create a deep impression on readers. Blumberg says this comes down to the podcast's ability ""to create intimacy and emotional connection."" Sydney University undergraduate Hazel Proust, major in social work and arts, agrees. ""When you're tuned in, it feels as if the voice of the podcast's narrator is talking directly to you. It's comforting,"" said Proust."	['You can listen to it at any time and any place.']
What can we learn about iPhone from the passage?	"Apple Inc co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs, counted among the greatest American CEOs of his generation, died on Wednesday at the age of 56, after a-year-long and highly public battle with cancer. Jobs' death was announced by Apple in a statement late on Wednesday. The Apple.com homepage featured a black-and-white picture of him with the words ""Steve Jobs, 1955-2011"". A message on the site read, ""Apple has lost an imaginary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring leader."" ""His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts."" ""Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple."" The Silicon Valley hero who gave the world the iPod and the iPhone had resigned as CEO of the world's largest technology corporation in August, handing the position to current chief executive Tim Cook. Two years before the iPhone that forever transformed the way people around the world access and use the Internet, Jobs talked about how a sense of his death was a major driver behind that vision. ""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever got to help me make the big choices in life,"" Jobs said during a Stanford commencement ceremony in 2005. ""Because almost everything-all others' expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure-these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."""

What should we do in order not to make Mother Nature angry?	In Singapore,most of us love window-shopping while some others enjoy having a picnic at East Coast Park or Changi Beach on sunny days.Singaporeans are never bothered by the occasional thunderstorm.However,we know that if it rains for long continuous periods,there will be more serious effects.Just recently the main shopping street of Orchard Road was flooded and some part of Bukit Timah was impassable to traffic.People reacted by writing in to the newspaper to complain about this! We forget that other countries suffer much worse effects. Elsewhere,heavy tropical storms often result in floods that ruin crops especially in Thailand and Malaysia.This in turn usually means that the price of rice and vegetables here in Singapore will rise because we import these products from them.If there is a typhoon or tsunami,thousands of lives are lost too.This happened in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand in 2004 and _ serves to remind us of how Mother Nature can cause great damage. Weather patterns in general have changed dramatically in recent years.Scientists believe that global warming and the resulting melting of the polar ice-cap has caused the level of the ocean to rise.This in turn causes flooding of low-lying areas in countries where the land is rather flat and some parts of which is below water level.It is believed that human activities have caused Mother Nature to show her extreme anger,so it is now important that we really work together to cut down on harmful activities,for example,illegal logging or irresponsible forest-burning to clear land for farming.

Although a lot of unfortunate matters happened to Jean, she is still _ .	"Well I decided to cut my front lawn today, especially since I live on a main street downtown with lots of traffic. Anyway, I finished mine and decided to cut my neighbor--Jean's grass while I was at it. She is a sweet person who has gone through some _ times in the last year. Her brother passed away of cancer last year; her sister (who lives with her) is mentally challenged--yet so sweet! It was a difficult time with physical and mental challenges that led her employer in our local hospital to let her go after 25 years of service! Lastly, my neighbor Jean, who is a nurse in our local hospital, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December. She went through radiation and a long recovery--but thankful she is in remission . Anyway, in short I was leaving my house this afternoon and she stopped me to thank me for cutting her grass. She told me her dad passed away on Friday and she just arrived home from the funeral service, so she didn't know when I would have time to cut her grass. So, when she arrived home and saw it cut she was more than happy and grateful! I said to her ""You are welcome, just a small act of kindness for a neighbor."" I did it for exercise and shared pleasure not knowing it meant more to her than just doing a neighbor a favor!"	['optimistic']
"Why did the writer smile inside when he heard of ""Mrs. Icicle Eyes"" playing basketball with students?"	"""Men get all the breaks!"" the veteran teacher announced to me. A cold greeting. Her stare stabbed like an icicle . ""Hello,"" I countered, extending my hand. ""I guess we'll be teaching together this year."" ""I swear, all you have to do is wear pants and walk into an elementary school and they hire you! It makes me sick!"" I would have responded, but she turned her back to me and stomped off down the hall. Who would have imagined that the biggest challenge I would face during my first year on the job would not be students, but fellow teachers? ""You can't put that there!"" Another teacher burst into my classroom. ""You can't put the teacher's desk at the back of the room!"" ""Pardon?"" ""If you put your desk way back there, you won't be able to see them cheating!"" Next I was told I must not arrange student desks into abutting clusters because ""the students might talk too much."" At home my wife kept assuring me, ""You're there for the kids. When you meet your students, things will be different."" And she was right. One day the bell rang and there were thirty-five wonderful sixth graders sitting at their desks (still arranged in clusters) and it was different. I was happy. ""Welcome to sixth grade."" I began the year as I'd rehearsed for months. ""You'll notice,"" I continued, ""my desk is at the back of the room."" They chuckled. ""I don't want that desk between us. I want to be involved in your learning and involved in your lives."" In the days that followed, I ate with my students at lunch ("" _ ""); I played with my students at recess ("" _ ""); I read with my students in the library ("" _ ""); I even stayed after school with some boys who got in trouble with the principal ("" _ ""). I went home to my wife. ""Don't worry,"" she said. ""They're just threatened by you because you're new and you're good. Let the other teachers know you're not a threat. Just keep being nice to them."" Obediently, I pulled out the Golden Rule, dusted it off, and vowed to start again. As I did with the children, I started looking for specific, positive things I could build upon and reinforce sincerely in my colleagues: ""Nice job on the announcements this morning!"" ""Wow! I like that worksheet you made up."" ""Man, your kids walked down the hall so quietly."" ""I heard your class singing great songs. You do a super job with music!"" ""I like your bulletin board,"" I said to Mrs. Icicle Eyes. ""Really?"" she asked. ""It's just the same old thing I put up every year."" She reached out and straightened a sagging border. Then, not unlike one of my students, she added, ""Do you really like it?"" ""Yes,"" I answered firmly. As sure as sun beams, the Golden Rule was shining, and things were finally warming up. That very afternoon, a few parents went to the principal's office asking if their sixth graders could be moved into my class. Of course the students were not transferred, but when the grapevine circulated the request, up went the old barbed wire fence. Complete with machine guns. I continued to do the best job I could. I worked. I taught. I cared. I waited for a breakthrough moment. Months passed. It was lunch recess. I asked a boy walking down the hall. ""Have you seen Mrs. So-and-So?"" I was, in fact, searching for Mrs. Icicle Eyes. I needed to consult with her. Grinning, he came toward me as if sharing a secret. ""She's outside shooting baskets with the girls!"" ""She's playing basketball with the girls?"" I asked incredulously. ""Yeah,"" he nodded. I smiled. I didn't say another word. But my smile inside was even bigger than the one on my face."

Which of the following is true, according to the passage?	"""The world has never been a better place to live in"" says science writer Matt Ridley, ""and it will keep on getting better."" Read on to see how Ridley makes his case. Right or wrong? You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today. They will last for many years and people will find something in place of oil long before they run out. The more we develop, the more we can develop. The more we invent, the more inventions become possible. For 200 years, pessimists (people who believe that terrible things will happen in future) have had all the headlines--even though _ have far more often been right. There are some reasons for pessimists. No charity ever raised money by saying things are getting better. No journalist ever got the front page writing a story about how terrible things won't happen. Don't be a pessimist--dare to be an optimist!"	"[""It's not necessary to be worried about oil reserves in the world.""]"
According to the passage, the final mouth shape is formed _ .	Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do.	['sometime after new teeth are set']
"Which of the following can replace ""chef""?"	"On 15 September 1918 Lee Duncan, an American soldier, rescued a half-starved shepherd and her five puppies from a bombed dog's kennel on the battle fields ofprefix = st1 /France.Duncanchose two of the dogs, a male and female, while members of his group took the mother and the others back to camp. The only survivors over the next few months were the two pups Duncan had claimed, naming them 'Rin Tin Tin' and 'Nannette' after tiny French puppets the French children would give to the American soldiers for good luck. When the war ended, Duncan made special arrangements to take his pups back to his home in Los Angeles, but during the Atlantic crossing, Nannette became ill and died, shortly after arriving inAmerica. In 1922, Duncan and Rin Tin Tin attended an LA dog show, his dog performing for the crowd with an impressive high jump. After the show,Duncanreceived $350 for Rin's performance. That was the beginning of Rin Tin Tin's later involvement in many films and television series It happened that Warners had difficulty shooting an exterior scene with a wolf as they got into a low budget. Duncanquickly approached the director and told them that his dog could do the scene in one take. True to his word, Rin did the scene in one take. As a result, he and his dog were hired for the entire shoot of ""Man From Hells River"". The film was a hit and Rin Tin Tin became a box-office star. It was the first American dog movie star. It made 26 pictures for Warners while starring in his own live 1930s radio show ""The Wonder Dog"". At the peak of his popularity, Warners kept 18 trained stand-ins to reduce any stress on their dog star. The star dog was worthy of the honor of having its private _ to prepare daily lunches for him. As a band was playing classical music it slowly consumed a lunch of tenderloin steak."	['cook']

The writer mainly wants to tell us_.	Olympic medalist Dara Torres, the 41-year-old swimmer, is more than a feel-good story. Torres is as determined and driven in her daily life as she is in the pool. She is dedicated to pursuing her passions and following her dreams-something she hopes to instill in her 2-year-old daughter and women and girls everywhere. After all, her dreams took her to Beijing. Upon her return after the Olympics, SUCCESS writer Don Yaeger, caught up with Torres, who shared her insights. What insights can you offer others ( non-athletes, too) about setting and staying on track to reach goals? Everyone has his highs and lows when doing things, but you have to remember what the end result is when you're having those tough times. I think about the end and about my feelings of success, and that keeps me going. I definitely set goals for myself and try not to get too distracted trying to reach them. And always remember to have fun ! Any strategies or tips for overcoming mental obstacles to be your very best? Mental obstacles are tough. For my personally, if I was having mental obstacles, I would talk to my coach, who was the most important person to me during this comeback. It's so important to have that person in your life, a trusted advisor. Communication is very important, and I've learned it's OK to turn to others if you're having a tough time. When I was younger, I would internalize(...) things. Not any more. It's a great relief to be able to share.	['Dara Torres pursues her passions in the pool and in life']
From the passage we can know that _ .	"I lay on the bed trying to put on my favorite pair of pants, pulling and dragging, but the zipper wouldn't close. Angrily I threw them to the back of the closet. I found a long large skirt, tied it around my middle, and then joined my husband downstairs. I caught sight of myself in the halfway mirror--I didn't like the person I saw. The weight kept climbing higher each year. The problem was that I hated the word ""diet"". To me it meant my keeping off every good thing I loved. Later that summer, I found myself out of breath when I climbed two flights of stairs and my heart started beating heavily. I saw my doctor and she told me that I needed to bring down my blood pressure. ""Easy for her to say,"" I thought when I drove back home. Up ahead I saw a McDonald's. I pulled in. The doctor's warning couldn't resist the pull of McDonald's food. The next morning I stepped on the scale and weighed more than I had ever had in my life. Just at the very moment, my thoughts were finally clear. To check the weight I needed to control my choices. Several days later, I went to my favorite restaurant for lunch--I only chose Chinese chicken salad. I felt great when I left the restaurant carrying a take-home box filled with half of that huge salad. But most of all, I discovered I had control over my choices. The weight came off slowly, but after a while it made no progress. Eating a light meal a couple of nights a week would help, but that meant I would prepare two separate dinners, for I would have to continue to make my husband his favorite meals, who supported my weight loss goal. Dusting off the old two--wheel vehicle in the garage, I added exercise by pedaling for 30 minutes after dinner. A year later I lost 25 pounds and my blood pressure was normal. I tried on my favorite pants again. They fit perfectly."	"[""the author's effort to lose weight turned out to be successful""]"
What would be the best title for the text?	"Most people want to know how things are made. They honestly admit, however, that they hardly know a thing when it comes to understanding how a piece of music is made. Where a composer begins, how he manages to keep going - in fact, how and when he learns his trade - all are covered in complete darkness. The composer, in short, is a man of mystery . One of the first things the common man wants to know about is the part inspiration plays in a composer's work. He finds it difficult to believe that composers are not much interested in that question. Writing music is as natural for the composer as eating or sleeping for all. Music is something that the composer happens to have been born for. The composer, therefore, does not say to himself: ""Do I feel inspired?"" He says to himself: ""Do I feel like working today?"" And if he feels like working, he does. It is more or less like saying to himself: ""Do I feel sleepy?"" If you feel sleepy, you go to sleep. If you don't feel sleepy, you stay up. If the composer doesn't feel like working, he doesn't work. It's as simple as that."	['Composer: a man of mystery']
According to the passage, an excursion .	Normally and naturally, a daughter is more attached to her mother in comparison to her father or other siblings . The attachment is also due to the fact that the daughter finds it easier to believe in the mother on personal and biological matters at different stages while growing up. The bonding between mother and daughter will increase with their being together and going out on excursions. An excursion is a journey to some far-off place undertaken by people. It is not necessary that such a trip be taken on a lavish scale involving lots of money. It can be as short as an overnight trip to some place to improve bonding. To surprise her daughter with an unexpected excursion, mother can plan a trip to some local spa without the knowledge of her daughter. She can be ready with baggage packed and wait for the moment the daughter comes back from school. Once in the hotel they can enjoy the night together getting refreshing treatments like massage or mud packs. After relaxing spa they can laze in bed, enjoying favourite food or drink and if possible enjoying nature through the window. After a long period of relaxation, going out for a walk together will improve bonding. Going out overnight to enjoy walk at the beach, and relaxing at intervals without the interference of any other person can be a great idea of bonding. Being of the same sex, and often having the same set of likes and dislikes, they can spend time on makeup or applying nail polish. The daughter should never forget to thank the mother for the wonderful time they spent together, and the mother should never hesitate to say a few words of praise to the daughter. Going out for shopping together is a good bonding idea too. It is not essential that lots of money should be spent on shopping. The mother can take the daughter to some shops where she can buy her uniform or some other things. They can jointly enjoy window shopping, expressing love and gratitude for the other.	['can be a short overnight trip']
What's the main idea of the text?	"Global Positioning Systems are now a part of everyday driving in many countries.These satellitebased systems provide turnbyturn directions to help people get to where they want to go.However,they can also cause a lot of problems,send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost.Many times,the driver is to blame.Sometimes a GPS error is responsible.Most often,says Barry Brown,it is a combination of the two. Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm,Sweden.He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States.There he borrowed a GPSequipped car to use during his stay.Mr Brown says,""They just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination.And,then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived.They actually put their home address in.So again,the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'."" Mr Brown says this is a common human error,but what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings,or failures,of GPS equipment.He says,""One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.Because they just give you the next turn,sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place."" Mr Brown says,""One of the things that struck us,perhaps the most important thing was that you have to know what you're doing when you use a GPS.There are these new skills that people have developed.There are these new competencies that you need to have to be able to use a GPS because they sometimes go wrong.This goes against a common belief that GPS systems are for passive drivers who lack navigational skills."" Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers,passengers and GPS systems work together."	['Driving with GPS can be difficult to navigate  .']
What would be the best title of this passage?	"Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside subjects like maths and languages. The class sit in a circle with their eyes shut and count from one to ten: one begins, the next voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side. The aim is to listen for an opportunity to shout the number without clashing with another voice or leaving a pause. On the first try, most of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in. But by the fifth round, they develop a rhythm. The message: giving other people space but also confidently claiming your own space is a requirement for social well-being. While the game suggests a soft course for the less bright, the school says it is trying to make it affect even clever pupils. The Willy Hellpach School is the first in the nation to develop a happiness course, intended for 17-19-year-olds preparing for university-entrance exams. ""The course isn't there to make you happy,"" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned the pupils who were taking the course, ""but rather to help you discover the ways to become happy."" Cooking a meal together will be one of the class exercises, along with improving body language under the guidance of two professional actresses. ""In the first period, we had to each say something positive about another member of the class and about ourselves. No laughing at people or teasing,"" said Fanny, 17. The message: self-esteem improves happiness too. The course is taught for three periods a week and will be graded as a part of overall assessment. Despite the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter. Max, 18, says he is happy when he finds people who share his interests. Janina, 18, says she needs to be fit to feel happy. ""We want to show how proper food or exercise can help in becoming happy,"" the principal said. He hopes other schools in Germany will copy the idea. The school has attracted national interest since it announced its new course."	['Learning How to Be Happy.']
What can we learn about the village site?	"Researchers have found a village that may have been home to the builders of Stonehenge. The village of small houses dates back to about 2600 BC. That's about the same time Stonehenge was built. ""Clearly, this is a place that was of great importance,"" said researcher Mike Parker Pearson. The ancient houses are at a site known as Durrington Walls. It is about 3.2 kilometers from Stonehenge. Researchers believe Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village also had a wooden version of the stone circle. It may have been used by people attending festivals at Stonehenge. Eight of the houses have been dug up. Researchers say there may be as many as 25 of them. The wooden houses were square and about 5 meters along each side. There are signs that there were beds along the walls. There are also signs of a storage unit. The houses also had fireplaces. Two of the houses were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Researchers say those didn't have the household rubbish that was found in the other homes. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads and other things were found throughout the village site. Stonehenge is a popular tourist spot in England. It is a huge circle made out of stones, which were placed in a grass field in southern England. The stone arches were made with two stones at the bottom and one across the top. All of the stones weigh a lot more than a big car. Scientists have long wondered not only how people built Stonehenge, but also why."	['Each of the wooden houses is about 25 square meters.']

On each potato the students had to write a name of a person that they hated And the next day, every child brought some potatoes. Some had two potatoes;some three;some up to five. Mrs. Smith then told the children to carry the bags everywhere they went, even to the toilet, for two weeks. As day after day passed, the children started to complain about the awful smell of the rotten potatoes. Those children who brought five potatoes began to feel the weight trouble of the bags. After two weeks, the children were happy to hear that the game was finally ended. Mrs. Smith asked,""How did you feel while carrying the potatoes for two weeks?"" The children started complaining about the trouble loudly. Then Mrs. Smith told them why she asked them to play the game. She said,""This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The terrible smell of the hatred will pollute your heart and you will carry something unnecessary with you all the time. If you cannot stand the smell of the rotten potatoes for just two weeks, can you imagine how heavy it would be to have the hatred in your heart for your lifetime? So throw away any hatred from your heart, and you'll be really happy. ,."	['names']

"According to the passage, during all of those years, ""we"" were told all of the following EXCEPT _ ."	"One day, a young man visited a small farm in the countryside. As he got closer to the farm, he saw many chickens and an eagle playing together. He then went up to the farm house and talked to the farmer, ""Sir, I was just passing by and I saw that you have many chickens and an eagle."" The farmer smiled and said, ""That's not an eagle. It's a chicken."" The young man kept saying that it was an eagle. He said to the farmer, ""Sir, that is an eagle! I can proveit to you."" The farmer laughed, ""Sure, go ahead."" The young man then pulled that big bird out and climbed a high mountain. He held the bird in his hands and said, ""You are an eagle, fly!"" But the bird failed. The young man tried the second time.

After the young man tried another three times, the bird began to flap its wings. Finally, it flew high and began to fly around the farm. It is true to us.

You can try to escape a fire except _ .	Escaping from a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save a life. It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone in the family, for example, you can use stairways, roofs and fire escapes, but no lifts. From the lower floors of buildings, to escape through windows is possible. Learn the best way of leaving by a window with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging from the window by the fingertips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground--about the height of an average man. Of course, _ Windows are also useful while you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, before opening the window. Otherwise, smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low next to the window to be sure you get fresh air. On the second or third floor, the best windows to escape from are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely.	['lifts']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Watching a 3D movie can more than double the concentration powers and cognitive processing of children, a new research claims. A study made by visual technology firm RealD and led by child psychologist Dr Richard Woolfson suggests that childrenaged between 7 and 14 experienced twice the cognitive processing speed and performed better in testing after watching 20 minutes of a 3D film. This is despite suggestions that attention spans in children have shortened in the last decade due tounlimitedto access to entertainment, including on-demand TV, gaming and social media. A 2015 study claimed that watching 3D content had a similar effect to brain-training exercises. Consumer psychologist Mr Fagan said that the increasedstimulation found in watching something in 3D ""exercised"" the brain and improved performance in the short term. ""3D films can play the role of 'brain-training' games and help to make children 'smarter' in the short term,"" he said. ""The shortening of response times after watching 3D was almost three times as big as that gained from watching 2D; in other words, 3D helps children process aspects of their environment more quickly. This is likely to be because 3D is a mentallystimulatingexperience which 'gets the brain's juices flowing'."" The experiment saw children given a range of cognitive tests before watching 20 minutes of a movie in either 2D or 3D and being tested again. The results showed those who saw the 3D content reacted faster and performed bettering the second round of testing. Mental engagement also rose by 13% among 3D watchers. Child psychologist Dr Woolfson added that ""supportive parenting"" and regularly listening to classical music can also aid a child's memory."

Why didn't the writer help his son?	"I went home one Saturday afternoon in the autumn of 1993 to get some work done in the garden. While sweeping leaves on the ground, my five-year-old son Nick came over and asked me to write something on a piece of paper to make a sign for him. ""What for?"" I asked. ""I'm going to sell some of my stones, "" he answered. Nick _ stones and had collected many stones from all over. ""I'm busy to do that for you. Go and ask your mum for help."" I said. A short time later, Nick returned with a sign, reading. "" Stones. One Dollar Each"". He took the sign, a small chair and 4 of his best stones and walked to the road in front of our garden. There he put the stones in a line and sat down on the chair. After half an hour, nobody passed by. I walked to him and asked him to go back, but he didn't. Another half hour later, a small car came down the road. I watched as Nick stood up, holding his sign up. A woman rolled down a window and read the sign. I couldn't hear their talk, but I saw the woman turn to the driver and the man reach for his pocket. I sat in the yard, as Nick ran to me. Waving the dollar, he shouted. ""I told you I could sell one stone for a dollar -- if you believe in yourself, you can do anything."""	['Because he was busy sweeping leaves.']
What's the reason that the eagle was disciplined?	"Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of"" a new world"".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a ""Charlie horse"" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum."	"[""He didn't do as teachers taught.""]"
The lesson we draw from the story is that _ .	"On November18, 1995, Itzhak Perlman, the world famous violinist, came on stage to give a concert at Lincoln Centre in New York City. If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on stage is not easy for him. He got polio as a child, and has to walk with the aid of two crutches now. That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise. People thought to themselves, ""He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one."" But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power. Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head. When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered. We were all on our feet, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what he had done. He smiled and then he said in a quiet tone, ""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can make with what you have left."" His words have stayed in my mind ever since I heard them. That is also the way of life. Perhaps our task in this quickly changing world in which we live is to make music, at first with all that we have, and then, when that is no longer possible, to make music with what we have left."	['we should make the best of what we have']
"In the author's opinion the biggest difference between ""bright"" children and ""not bright"" children lies in _ ."	"When we talk about intelligence, we do not mean the ability to get good scores in certain kinds of tests or even the ability to do well in school. By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or anxious situation. If we want to test intelligence, we need to find out how a person acts instead of how much he knows what to do. For example, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks about the situation, not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then he acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And, if he can't make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he fails; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook on life, special feeling about life, and knows how he fits into it. If you look at children, you'll see great difference between what we call ""bright"" children and ""not bright"" children. They are actually two different kinds of people, not just the same kind with different amounts of intelligence. For example, the bright child really wants to find out more about life --- he tries to get in touch with everything around him. But the unintelligent child keeps more to himself and his own dream-world; he seems to have a wall between him and life in general."	['the different attitudes to life']
According to the passage, Mount Yasur _ .	Vanuatu is an island nation in the South Pacific. It is one of the smallest countries in the world. But for those who are interested in adventure and sport, there is a lot to do. Vanuatu's islands offer visitors two of the most exciting and dangerous activities in the world: volcano surfing and land diving. Volcano Surfing On Tanna Island, Mount Yasur rises 300 meters into the sky. Yasur is an active volcano, and it erupts almost every day, sometimes several times a day. For centuries, people have climbed this mountain to visit the top. Recently, people have also started climbing Yasur to surf the volcano. In some ways, volcano surfing is like surfing in the sea, but in other ways it's very different. Volcano surfers try to escape the erupting volcano--without getting hit by flying rocks! It's fast, fun and dangerous--the perfect extreme sport . Land Diving Most people are familiar with bungee jumping, but do you know bungee jumping started on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu and is almost fifteen centuries old? The activity, first called land diving, is part of a religious ceremony . A man ties tree vines to his legs. He then jumps head-first from a high tower to touch the earth with the top of his head--without breaking the vine. Every spring, island natives (men only) still take part in this amazing activity.

The author thinks actors' life is _ .	Many people think it is very exciting and admirable to be an actor. The actors often wear the most beautiful and fashionable clothes and they can make a lot of money. Many people like them and they have so many fans. But in fact, the job of an actor can be very tiring and hard. To make good movies, for example, action movies, the actors need to go to some remote places. There they don't have good places to stay or nice food to eat. They often have to get up early and go to bed very late. When they are too busy, they don't have time to sleep or relax. It's very hard.

Which group makes up the largest percentage of disabled people in China.	China is a country with a large number of disabled persons. Almost 60 million people have vision, hearing, speech, limb, intellectual or mental disabilities. There is one disabled person in every 20 Chinese, and one out of every five households on average has a disabled family member. According to nationwide surveys of the disabled children under 14 account for 16 percent of the total disabled population, and they display the greatest need for rehabilitative training as they display the highest recovery rates after early treatment. Those disabled between the ages of 15 and 59 account for 44 percent, but often their disabilities are not very serious. Although they are more or less able to work, they require vocational training, cultural education and special employment. The disabled over 60 years of age account for 40 percent. Many of them become disabled due to illness or loss of various functions. Some live alone without any income, and therefore their insurance, rehabilitation, and medical needs have become a social issue. The illiterate and semi-illiterate suffer from limited employment opportunities, and often they become socially disabled as well. These people, often neglected , pose another social problem.

What does Will Gompertz think of Alice Munro?	"Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called Alice Munro a ""master of the contemporary short story"". ""She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to live a little bit in the shadow of the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,"" he said. The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13thwoman to win the Nobel Prize for literature since its start in 1901. ""I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,"" Munro told Canadian media. Alice Munro: ""I would really hope that this would make people see the short story as an important art form."" Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950. Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award. In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work -- but she downplayed her achievements. ""I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents,"" she once said in an interview. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been ""at the very top of her game since she started"". ""Very few writers are her equal,"" he said, adding ""She gets to the heart of what it is to be human"". The award ""probably won't make a commercial difference"" to the author, he added, but it ""makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"". ""If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission ."" Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.

How many exchange children did Qing government send to America?	"Many thousands of Chinese are studying at schools in the United States. And writer Liel Leibovitz says the students are following an example that began in the eighteen seventies. Mr. Leibovitz and writer Matthew Miller joined forces to tell the story of the students in their book, ""Fortunate Sons."" The book says China sent one hundred twenty boys from 1872 to 1875 to America to learn about developments that could help modernize their country. Mr. Leibovitz got the idea for the book about the boys a few years ago when he was traveling with his wife in China. Mr. Leibovitz learned that Qing government sent a whole delegation of boys to learn the ways of the West. The goal was for them to return to China and help their country. The book says the boys received their American training in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It must have been a very good education. Mr. Leibovitz says the first prime minister of the Chinese Republic completed this program. And so did the first engineer to build a large-scale railroad without foreign help. The same was true of the fathers of Chinese education, diplomacy and the Navy. The book-writers had only to open some boxes containing the writings of these men to learn about them. Their notebooks, journals, letters and postcards were in English. Mr. Leibovitz said he was lucky to have so much information from events that took place long ago. The students returned to China after about nine years. They no longer spoke Mandarin well enough to answer questions. Police welcomed them home by putting them in jail. The young men were released after about a week. But they were given low-level jobs. Mr Leibovitz says it took about ten years for them to rise to higher positions. He said their story continues today with large numbers of Chinese studying in the United States."	['120.']
Mount Kilimanjaro is _	Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and one of the largest free-standing mountains in the world, and some say, the most beautiful place on the earth! The mountain towers 15,000 feet above the plains. Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania and it covers an area of 60 miles long and 40 miles wide. Kilimanjaro is an extinct volcano , with 3 peaks. Kibo is the highest one in the center. Because of Kilimanjaro's great height, the mountain influences its own weather. Winds incoming from the Indian Ocean are stopped upward by the mountain and drop their moisture as rain and snow. People have planted coffee, corn, and other crops on the lower slopes . Mount Kilimanjaro now attracts many thousands of walkers each year. Because of a temperature rise in recent years, the beautiful snow cap of Kilimanjaro is retreating fast. A research said that the white snow on the mountain might be gone in 15 years. What a pity!	['a free-standing mountain']
What would be the best title for this passage?	Popular music in America is what every student likes. Students carry small radios with earphones and listen to music before class, after class, and at lunch. Students with cars buy large speakers and play the music loudly as they drive on the street. Adult drivers listen to music on the car radio as they drive to work. They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmers are music. Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or a tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star. There are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is western or country music. This was started by cowboys who would sing at night to the cows they were watching. Today, any music about country life and the 1ove between a country boy and his girl is called western or country music. ,.	['American Music.']
What might be the author's purpose in writing the passage?	Forty years ago, Finland was a small country with ordinary public schools. Today, Finland is still small but no one calls Finland's public schools ordinary anymore. In 2000, the Finns surprised the world when their 15yearolds scored at the top of a closelywatched international exam called the PISA, the Program for International Student Assessment. Finland has stayed near the top ever since, while the US scores around the middle. Pasi Sahlberg, an official of Finland's Ministry of Education and Culture, is in Seattle this week to share the story of Finland's success, and what states like Washington can learn from it. Sahlberg's message, although he is too polite to put it so directly: Stop testing so much. Trust teachers more. Give less homework. Shorten the school day. On Tuesday, in a room filled with teachers, principals, professors, schoolboard members and policy makers, Sahlberg joked about the Finns' reputation for being a quiet, humble people. When Finland hit the top of the PISA, he said, the biggest disbelievers were Finns. More seriously, he said, Finland never set out to create the world's top school system. Instead, he said, the country decided in the 1970s that it wanted to ensure that a student's success didn't depend on family background. To achieve that goal, Finland relied on cooperation among teachers and schools, rather than on competition. Rather than judges teachers and schools based on test scores, he said, Finland puts trust in its teachers and principals. Teachers develop the curriculum in Finland, and design their own tests. There are no national tests, except one at the end of high school. That's just the start. Along with a shorter school day, Finnish students don't even start school until they are 7 years old. Many primary schools have a policy against giving homework. But Finland, he said, succeeded in part by adapting ideas from the US and other countries. And those countries, he said, can learn from Finland, too.	"[""To share the story of Finland's success in education.""]"

There are both Vitamins A and D in _ .	The vitamins are named by letters of the alphabet . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body. Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat. Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them. Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important.	['milk']
For what purpose does the author write the passage?	What can you say about a vibrant city that I once called home? Is she beautiful or brilliant? Do these lines sound familiar to you? If you have read the book or seen the movie 'Love Story' you would know that my opening lines are 'inspired' from it. And it fits! I fell in love with Hong Kong at first sight! It's the city where I set up our first home, raised our son, and studied my MBA. Our first encounter was in October 2010, when my husband and I were there for a week to visit the city we would be calling home for the next few years. Once we entered the city, what impressed us was its vibrancy and almost immediately I was convinced to make that city our home. A few months later, we settled down and I loved everything about Hong Kong! The wet markets, the modern shopping malls, the bargaining at Mongkok, the fine foods...there is so much to experience. Then came the MBA, which took the entire experience to a different level. I was so nervous about returning to books after almost a decade. I thought I would struggle a lot with the academic requirements. But, I made it. I am so happy to have so many good memories to write in this blog. One thing for which I will always be grateful is the opportunity to travel. And Hong Kong gave me plenty of that. I feel enriched just having visited some of the neighboring countries. I am living in another city that I love----London now. However, Hong Kong, for all its sights and smells, was once home to me and my family. I WILL MISS YOU!

How many times did the two crows argue?	"Once there were two crows whose opinions were always opposite. One day, one of the crows said to the other, "" You should realize, of course, that I can fly much higher than you."" "" Don't be ridiculous ."" the other crow said. "" Everyone knows that I can fly much higher than you."" ""No, you can't"" the first crow said. ""Yes, I can"" the second crow replied, and the argument went on and on. At last they decided to have a contest to solve the argument. "" We will compete to find out who can fly higher while carrying a bag"" the first crow said. They argued for some time because of the size of the bag, but at last _ . Then there was a further argument about what each bag would be filled with. Finally, they agreed that the first crow would fill his bag with cotton and the second crow would fill his with salt. The first crow thought he was clever to agree to this, because salt is much heavier than cotton. At last they were ready for the contest. Holding their bag in their mouths, they flew into the sky. They had not been flying for long. However, when it began to rain- as the second crow had expected it would. Can you guess who could fly higher?"	['Three times']
The writer will not agree that _ .	"A peer is a person who is about the same age as you. Peers affect your life, whether you know it or not, just by spending time with you. Peers can have a good effect on one another. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book and now everyone's reading it. However, sometimes peers affect one another in another way. For example, one kid in school might try to get another to cut class with him, your soccer friend might try to persuade you to be mean to another player and never pass her the ball, or a kid in the neighborhood might want you to with him. Some kids give in to peer pressure because they want to be liked, to fit in, or because they worry that other kids may make fun of them if they don't go along with the group. Others may go along because they are curious to try something new that others are doing. The idea that "" everyone's doing it"" may influence some kids to leave their better judgments or their common senses behind. Peer pressure can be extremely strong and hard to get rid of. Experiments have shown how peer pressure can influence someone to change her/ his mind from what she/ he knows for sure is a correct answer to the incorrect answer----just because everyone else gives the incorrect answer! That holds true for people of any age in peer pressure situations. It can be hard to walk away from peer pressure, but it can be done. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. Inner strength and self- confidence can help you stand firm, walk away and resist doing something when you know better."

Which can best describe Dylan's mom's attitude towards life today?	"To the mom I used to be: Two years ago, you were happy and whole. You had a plan for life -- start a new business, get involved in the Parent-teacher Association, teach your sons how to ride bicycles, spend as much time with your friends and parents as possible, watch your children mature and grow old with your husband. You were a "" _ "" person who often felt so much joy. You always looked forward, smiled and danced. Two years ago, on December 14, 2012, the world changed and you changed with it. Disturbed young men with access to high-powered guns went to your sons' school and killed six educators and twenty first-graders. Your eldest son Jake survived, but was changed by the day he discovered some monsters are real. He describes it as the day ""when evils came to my school."" Your youngest son, Dylan, whom you thought of as a pure love, with his charming eyes and infectious giggle ,was killed. Shot multiple times, he died instantly in the arms of his special-education assistant who also died while trying to protect him. The tragedy changed all your life, not only because of losing your child, but because of the hole inside you that can never be filled. Your eldest son has been forced to grow up too fast because of the loss of his brother. The pain has altered the lines on your husband's face. The way you look at the world has changed. Your interactions with friends and family seem foreign. ... ... But the things have moved on with hopefulness. You are now someone far more realistic. You control your feelings because you fear if you really let it out, you would never recover. It would destroy you. You know what you should do is try everything to protect more children. You're fighting a good fight, what the whole society really needs. With love, Nicole Hockley, Dylan's mom"	['Positive.']

The author enjoys playing on the stage so as to _ .	"Childhood was an illusion and the illusion was this: everything was bigger. No, I mean everything, not just houses and shops and grown-ups, but colors and flowers and journeys, especially journeys which seemed endless. ""Are we there yet, Daddy?"" Funfairs were huge things that spread for miles around you with noise and lights and exciting danger. Rainy days at home when you were ill seemed to last for ever. Being a grown-up yourself was an unthinkable distant possibility. Every sound was louder, every game was grander, every pain unbearable. As I've grown old, life has become smaller. Tastes have dulled. Surprises have turned into shocks. Days go by unnoticed. How can I regain childhood when it was an illusion? I have only one repeatable and wonderful way and even in this way I can regain only part of that larger world. I can play upon the stage like a child and make the crowd laugh and laugh with them, sometimes helplessly like a child, and then, even though I'm a sixty-one-year-old man, I can almost catch the colors and sounds and stillness of those bigger years when I was little."

The main idea of this passage is _	Every day we go to school and listen to teachers, and the teacher will ask us some questions. Sometimes,the classmates will ask your opinions of the work of the class. When you are telling others in the class what you have found out about these topics, remember that they must be able to hear what you are saying. You are not taking part in a family conversation or having a chat with friends--you are in a situation where a large group of people will remain silent, waiting to hear what you have to say. You must speak so that they can hear you loudly enough and clearly enough but without trying to shout or appearing to force yourself. Remember, too, that it is the same if you are called to an interview whether it is with a professor of your school or a government official who might meet you. The person you are seeing will try to put you at your ease ordinary conversation but the situation is somewhat different from that of an ordinary conversation. You must take special care that you can he heard.	['that we must use different ways at different situations']
According to the passage, the 20s is an age for people to _ .	"Ask a group of elderly people what it was about their lives that made them happiest overall, and they'll probably mention some warm relationships with family and friends. If you're satisfied with your social life, according to psychologists, you tend to be satisfied with life in general. From the point of my 50s, I'd say that sounds about right. Some of my happiest moments are the ones I spend with my husband, a few close relatives, and a handful of very good friends who know me well and like me anyway. But the more I read about how social media are interfering with good old-fashioned friendship, creating virtual bonds that can't quite take the place of real ones, the more I wonder just how today's 20-somethings will look back on their own lives when they're my age. After all, much crucial relationship building work is done in the 20s. According to research by the late Bernice Neugarten of the University of Chicago, who helped launch the academic study of human development, people choose most of their adult relationships, both friends and lovers, between the ages of 22 and 28. The friends we make in our 20s are not only best friends forever; they're also our first truly chosen friends. And choosing how to commit to these friendships is an essential psychological task of the 20s. But with so much of friendship in this age group now being developed online, an essential question is what the effect of that interaction is. A study, conducted in 2010 by Craig Watkins and Erin Lee of the University of Texas at Austin, investigated the Facebook habits of 776 young people between the ages of 18 and 35. ""Whether it is a wall post, a comment, or a photo,"" they wrote, ""young people's engagement with Facebook is driven, primarily, by a desire to stay connected to and involved in the lives of friends who live close by, far away, or have just entered into their lives."" This kind of constant contact can be efficient, but it can also be upsetting. For one thing, it adds a new layer of concern to a young person's already-heightened awareness of social ranking, giving appearance-conscious young people yet another thing to worry about. ""I see other 20-somethings feeling pressured to constantly keep up a public image, especially a public image online,"" wrote Ariana Allensworth on the group blog. ""Folks are always keeping the world informed one way or another about what they're up to, where they're at, what projects they're working on. It can be a bit much at times."" Not the most fertile ground for real-world friendship."	['develop critical relationships']
Which of the following things is /are harmful according to the passage?	"As a result of pollution, Lake Erie, on the borders of the USA and Canada, is now without many living things. Pollution in water is not simply a matter of ""poisons"" killing large numbers of fish overnight. Very often the effects of pollution are not noticed for many months or years because the first organisms to be affected are either plants or plankton . These organisms are the food of fish, birds, and other creatures. When this food disappears, the fish and birds die too. In this way a whole food chain can be wiped out, and it is not until dead fish and water birds are seen at the river's edge or on the sea shore that people realize what is happening. Where do the substances which pollute water come from? There are two main sources, sewage and industrial waste. As more detergent is used in homes, more of it is finally put into our rivers, lakes and seas. Detergents harm water birds by breaking down the natural substances which keep their feathers _ Sewage itself, if not properly treated, makes the water dirty and prevents all forms of life in rivers and the sea from receiving the oxygen they need. Industrial waste is even more harmful since there are many highly poisonous materials in it, such as copper and lead. So if we want to stop this pollution, the answer is simple. Sewage and industrial waste must be made clean before flowing into the water reservoirs. It may already be too late to save some rivers and lakes, but others can still be saved if the correct action is taken at once."	['Industrial waste and chemicals']
Why does David E. Levy keep his door half open?	"Finding time to enjoy life is becoming harder and harder. As the average workweek lengthens, leisure time drops. Yet some of the world's busiest people are able to develop rewarding careers and also make time for family and leisure activities. Here is their best advice plus that of time-management experts: 1. Use your peak hours wisely. People tend to be most alert in late morning and midevening. Afternoon brings an increase in sleepiness. Use your high-efficiency hours to handle difficult jobs or engage in creative thinking. For low-efficiency times, concentrate on cleaning up or sorting your mail. By adapting to your mental condition, you can accomplish more in less time. 2. Make a plan. Just 20 minutes of organizing can save an hour of extra effort remembering what must be done. ""Don't try to carry your life around in your head,"" says Lucy Hedrick, author of Five Days to an Organized Life. ""Write things down so you can free your brain for more inventive pursuit ."" 3. Discourage drop-ins. The person who welcomes every visitor will get plenty of conversation but won't accomplish much. The trick is to develop harmless ways to protect yourself from minute-stealing interruptions. David E. Levy, a public-relations consultant , uses an alternative to the open-door policy by keeping his door half open. The message is clear: he really doesn't want you to come in, but you can if it is important. 4. Tame the telephone. Few devices save more minutes--or waste so many more--than the telephone. Signal the end of your conversation with a phrase such as ""Before we hang up..."" You can save even more time by not taking every incoming call. Keep a record of when people you call regularly are least busy and call them at those times. Even better, make appointments to call important contacts. To help us gain an extra hour every day, a clockmaker in Dallas has created a timer measuring each minute at 57.6 seconds. The 2.5 seconds borrowed from each minute add up to an extra 60 minutes at the end of each day."	['To keep unimportant visitors from dropping in.']
What problem do teachers face in the author's opinion?	"Some parents say summer is the time when teachers should get more pay.But not everyone is grateful to teachers for keeping kids occupied between June and August--Washington state representative Liz Pike has written a Face book post and responded to teachers' complaints of rising cost of living.After reading her post,I feel that Liz Pike should rethink her criticism of public school teaching and avoid comparing it to the private sector. Many of us teachers would certainly like teaching to be more like the private school.It's nothing wrong with fair pay for fair performance.With standardized testing popular throughout the education, teachers are some of the most analyzed and performance-measured employees in the United Sates. Liz Pike is very angry that teachers want raises even while test scores are dropping.Well,how are they supposed to have discipline in the classroom when our hands are tied and we can hardly do anything with naughty students? Teachers would love to be able to turn education around and improve student performance.,However, unlike private school businesses.public schools cannot turn away ""customers"".A private school business serves customers who walk through the door of their own free will,while public schools have to educate students who only attend school because laws say they must. She says those teachers who are uninspired by a lack of a cost of living increases should give up teaching.Is this the message that she thinks should be sent to the students whose academic performance she claims to care so much about? I think supporting teachers can make teachers teach children how to stand up for themselves."	['Popular standardized tests and their tied hands.']
"Why were toy bears named ""Teddy""?"	"The early 1900s were very different from today, when toys were still the delight of children everywhere. Theodore Roosevelt's Presidency marks the beginning of the ""Teddy Bear"". In the year 1902,toy bears were named ""Teddy"" after the president's nickname. The Teddy Bear became known worldwide and it was only a few years later that the Teddy Bears were mass produced. In 1913,an item called the Erector Set was invented. It was a steel,motorized toy that children could use to build models of anything. Its creator was A.C.Gilbert,a medical doctor. Charles Pajeau created a similar wooden set called Tinker Toys in the year 1914.Tinker Toys were made for younger children. Raggedy Ann dolls first came on the scene after newspaper cartoonist Johnny Gruelle reproduced the doll he made for his daughter. That was in 1915. The following year,an architect's son named John Lloyd Wright,invented Lincoln Logs,which were interlocked to make structures. Two years after Mickey Mouse was created,stuffed Mickey Mouse dolls were made by Charlotte Clark. This was the start of Disney merchandise. The yoyo became popular in the United States after Donald Duncan bought a yoyo company in 1929. The ViewMaster,a three dimensional viewer,was developed by a camera enthusiast named William Gruber. The toy became popular when Gruber licensed Disney characters to make still, 3D images from Disney movies and television programs. Finally,in 1940,model airplanes were mass produced. They started out as a way for manufacturers to sell planes to the military,but later caught on as a toy. The toys that we know and love today have had their roots from these ancient times. Thanks to all these creative man's efforts, we know otherwise what we may never know."	['To memorize President Theodore Roosevelt']
How old was he when he moved to Paris and how old was he when he died?	"Pablo Picasso was born in Spain in 1881.His father was a painter and art teacher who gave his son the first lesson in drawing.He won a prize--""Science and Charity"" for his first important painting when he was only fifteen.He studied in several cities in Spain.But there was no one to teach him all that he wanted to know.When he was nineteen,he visited Paris. Paris was then the center of the world for artists.Everything that was new and exciting in the world of paintings seemed to happen there.When he was twenty-three,Picasso moved there to live and lived in France for the rest of his life. When he was over ninety,this great painter still lived his life like a young man.He was still looking for new ideas and new ways to use his artistic materials. When he died in 1973,he was ninety-one years old. ,."	['Twenty-three and ninety-one.']
What's the best title for the passage?	"Have you ever dreamed of visiting a planet in the Milky Way? While the trip sounds exciting, it would take years and years to reach the place that we are going to. So in the future, bedtime for astronauts may be more than a few hours of regular shut-eye. They would have to sleep for years. European researchers are now doing hibernation experiments. The study may help them understand whether humans could ever sleep through the years it would take for a space flight to distant planets. ""If there was an effective technology, it could make deep-space travel come true,"" said Mark Ayer of the European Space Agency last month. What seems like science fiction is not completely impossible. Researchers have been able to use chemicals to put living cells into a sleep-like state where they don't age. They have now moved on to small, non-hibernating mammals like rats. The results will be out soon. A major challenge is the fact that cells can be very simple systems, but body organs are far more complex . ""It's like moving from a simple Apple computer to a supercomputer,"" said Marco Biggiogera, a hibernation researcher at Italy's University of Pavia. Just like bears and frogs, the hibernation of human beings would cause a person's metabolism to lower so they would need less energy. Medical research, however, is just half of a space flight hibernation system. There is the challenge of designing a suitable protective place to live. Such a place would provide the proper environment for hibernation, such as the proper temperature. It would also have to monitor life functions and serve the physiological needs of the hibernator. According to Ayer, the six-person Human Outer Planets Exploration Mission to Jupiter's moon Callisto, could be an opportunity to use human hibernation. The mission aims to send six humans on a five-year flight to Callisto, where they will spend 30 days, in 2045. , ."	['Hibernation study for space travel']

We may infer from the passage that _ .	There is much discussion today about whether economic growth is desirable. At an earlier period, our desire for material wealth may have been justified. Now, however, this desire for more than we need is causing serious problems. Even though we have good intentions, we may be producing too much, too fast. Those who criticize economic growth argue that we must slow down. They believe that society is approaching certain limits on growth. These include the fixed supply of natural resources, the possible negative effects of industry on the natural environment, and the continuing increase in the world's population. As society reaches these limits, economic growth can no longer continue, and the quality of life will decrease. People who want more economic growth, on the other hand, argue that even at the present growth rate there are still many poor people in the world. These proponents of economic growth believe that only more growth can create the capital needed to improve the quality of life in the world. Furthermore, they argue that only continued growth can provide the financial resources required to protect our natural surroundings from industrialization. This debate over the desirability of continued economic growth is of vital importance to business and industry. If those who argue against economic growth are correct, the problems they mention cannot be ignored. To find a solution, economists and business community must pay attention to these problems and discuss them with one another.	['the author describes the case as it is']
What can we learn about the robot players?	The end of the 2014 World Cup does not mean the end of the international competition in Brazil. A major football event which is known as RoboCup will be held in the coastal city Joao Pessoa. Teams of robots from around the world will take part in _ and play the game known as soccer in the United States. The robot teams are guided by teams of human beings. Watching robots play football is similar to watching children play the game. The kicks are not good, there are a lot of falls , and people are there to guide and support the robot players. Students of the University of Pennsylvania are trying for their fourth victory at the competition. The students have won the last three RoboCup competition in the Netherlands, Mexico and Turkey. Jian Qiaoli is one of the leaders of the University of Pennsylvania team. He says one goal he has set for his team is to make sure the robots can find the ball and know where they are on the playing field. And he wants the team to be able to better control the walking ability of the robots. They should pay more attention to the kicking ability, which is the key to winning the game. Qin He is another leader of the robot team. She says the abilities of the robots improve every year. The robots know the difference between the colors green and red, and they can decide where to go and where the ball is on the playing field. She says the robots are self-learning and don't need to be told what to do. If there are three robot players on the playing field at the same time, they will communicate with each other to decide different responsibility for each of them. They have very good team play right now. As long as the radar detection works well, the robots will be very competitive. So RoboCup will be an exciting technology competition.

According to the passage, in the future cars will be _ .	"It's exciting to imagine how future humans will have solved the problems we have now, or what amazing new inventions will make our lives more convenient and interesting. We asked top scientists to share their predictions on what the world will be like in a century. If they're right, the 2114 is going to be really cool. 1. Robots will do your chores and more Robots will be doing most of our jobs, from building homes to teaching math. There are already robots that clean floors and pump gas. In the future they will be more complicated and useful. Unfortunately, with robots taking all the jobs, unemployment will be high. 2. You will read minds. Speaking of being social, we will communicate in an entirely different way. Forget texts and emails. Mind-reading technology will allow us to send thoughts to each other without speaking a word. We will also be able to send thoughts to objects around us. (Instead of pressing ""start"" on the microwave, you could just think ""start."") Meanwhile, chips implanted(in our brains will improve memory and intelligence. 3. Your car will drive you Today, around 30,000 Americans die in car accidents each year. One hundred years form now, accidents will be a thing of the past. According to Mark Safford, consultant or the U.S. Department of Transportation, future cars will drive themselves. These electric cars will communicate with other cars on the road to travel safely in close formation at high speeds. 4. You will eat fake meat. Raising animals is not an efficient way to produce food, and it harms the environment: Cows, chickens, and pigs eat a lot, and then we have to deal with all that poop(. What's more, that poop can up poisoning lakes, rivers, and streams. Today, scientists can ""grow"" meat in a lab from animal cells, but it's expensive and not very delicious. In the future, they will have perfected the process. You'll order hamburgers that come from factories, not cows. Scientists may even find ways to make lab-grown meat tastier and healthier than the real thing."	['much easier to operate']

The best title of the passage will probably be _ .	"Mary Buendia once spent a day in an airplane, looking for a cat. She didn't find it that day. The plane flew around all over the world for three weeks with the cat on board. She finally found it in the cargo hold and sent it home first-class. Another time ,she found two suitcases full of birds from Turkey. But her strangest experience was when she pulled a snake out of a man's pants. Mary Buendia is an animal health inspector at JFK Airport in New York. She takes care of all the animals that pass through the airport and checks that they are healthy. In the Animal Health Center, there are areas for dogs, cats, reptiles, birds, and fish. There is also an area for very big animals. The biggest they ever had was a black rhino. ""It was no problem."" she says. At the center, they receive all types of animals monkeys, wild cats, poisonous spiders. It's impossible for one person to know about all of these, but there are 20 people working with Mary. Among them, they understand how to take care of the animals. She recently had to feed a group of toucans, which are rare birds. ""luckily,"" she says, ""there is a supermarket nearby which is open 24 hours. I had to go at 2 a.m to buy bananas. Mary often works at night. ""It's quiet between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m."" she says, ""because we don't have night flights. We try to give the animals a quiet night."" Mary clearly loves her job. ""You never know what the day will bring,""she says, and goes off to feed the birds."	['Airport Health Inspector']
What is the finding of the study?	"Fear may be felt in the heart as well as in the head, according to a study that has found a link between the cycles of a beating heart and the chance of someone feeling fear. Tests on healthy volunteers found that they were more likely to feel a sense of fear at the moment when their hearts are contracting and pumping blood around their bodies, compared with the point when the heartbeat is relaxed. Scientists say the results suggest that the heart is able to influence how the brain responds to a fearful event, depending on which point it is at in its regular cycle of contraction and relaxation. Sarah Garfinkel at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School said: ""Our study shows for the first time that the way in which we deal with fear is different depending on when we see fearful pictures in relation to our heart."" The study tested 20 healthy volunteers on their reactions to fear as they were shown pictures of fearful faces. Dr Garfinkel said, ""The study showed that fearful faces are better noticed when the heart is pumping than when it is relaxed. Thus our hearts can also affect what we see and what we don't see - and guide whether we see fear."" To further understand this relationship, the scientists also used a brain scanner to show how the brain influences the way the heart changes a person's feeling of fear. ""We have found an important _ by which the heart and brain 'speak'to each other to change our feelings and reduce fear,"" Dr Garfinkel said. ""We hope that by increasing our understanding about how fear is dealt with and ways that it could be reduced, we may be able to develop more successful treatments for anxiety disorders, and also for those for those who may be suffering from serious stress disorder."""	"[""One's heart affects how he feels fear.""]"
What is the passage mainly talking about?	A couple of years ago, those who forecast that oil price would reach $ 100 a barrel were seen as doomsters. However, now some are predicting $ 200 a barrel. Had economists been told that oil price would barely pause at $ 100 before reaching the recent peak of nearly $ 127, they would no doubt have forecast terrible economic consequences. But the global economy, though interrupted by the high price of energy, is still chugging along. Meanwhile, inflation has picked up, but the headlinerates of inflation in most developed countries are nowhere near the levels seen in the 1970s and 1980s. There are three explanations for the oil price's unclear impact. The first is that nowadays developed economies are more efficient in their use of energy, thanks partly to the increased importance of service industries and the diminished role of manufacturing . According to the Energy Information Administration, the energy intensity of America's GDP fell by 42% between 1980 and 2007. A second theory is that the oil-price rise has been steady, not sudden, giving the economy time to adjust. Giovanni Serio of Goldman Sachs points out that in 1973 there was a severe supply shock because of the oil embargo , when the world had to cope with 10%-15% less crude almost overnight. Not this time. The third explanation turns the argument on its head; rather than oil harming the global economy, it is global expansion that is driving up the price of oil. The most important factor is the shift in favor of the developing economies. America has responded to high price in familiar fashion: UBS forecasts that demand will drop by 1.1% this year and will be no higher in 2010 than it was in 2004. But the demand from China and other emerging markets is more than offsetting this shortfall.	['The increase of oil price']
Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?	"He leant down to the pickpocket The heaving and gasping had stopped, but he was still making a show of his breathlessness. ""That's better,"" Mallon said. ""Can you stand up? Try to stand up. Here."" he said, and gripped the pickpocket's arm and forced him upright until he saw his face for the first time. As the pickpocket labored for breath, he gazed up at Mallon with his dark eyes. ""How could you?"" they asked. Mallon might have said, ""Because you tried to steal from me."" But he was still conscious of the flush of joy he'd felt when his blow struck home-when he knew he'd hurt the man. Where that joy came from he couldn't say, but he knew that its roots were deeper than some clumsy failed theft. Fat drops of rain began to patter on the awning . ""How are you?"" Mallon said. ""Can you walk?"" The pickpocket turned away and leant against the store window with both hands, and his head sank lower as his shoulders rose and fell. A gray-haired woman inside the store rapped on the glass and made a shooing motion. When the pickpocket ignored het she rapped harder and kept rapping. ""I have to go,"" Mallon said. ""I'm sorry."" He looked up at the sky. ""I'm sorry,"" he said again, and stepped into the rain and walked quickly up the street. One of the Bangladeshi umbrella sellers was working the comer, and Mallon had just paid seven euros when he heard a woman shouting. He didn't want to look back but did. It was the woman from the shop. pushing and batting the pickpocket away from the window while he bent down and covered his head like a boxer trying to get through the 1ast seconds of a round. Mallon slipped his wallet back into his jacket pocket and took the umbrella that the Bangladeshi had opened for him. The pickpocket was out on the sidewalk now, in the rain. The woman stood just under the awning with her arms crossed over her chest. ""Excuse me, madam,"" Mallon said, coming up to them. ""This man isn't well. He needs to rest a moment. '' ""I know these people."" she said. ""Our Romans don't want them here."" The rain fell in sheets, ran down the pickpocket's shiny scalp and face, down his 1eather jacket. ""Here."" Mallon said, and offered him the umbrella, but he only looked at Mallon with his hurt dark eyes and then lowered his head again Mallon bumped him in the shoulder with the handle of the umbrella ""Go on-take it!"" he said. And finally, with a beaten. unwilling look, the pickpocket did. And that was when he saw a taxi round the corner with a 1ight glowing on its roof. Mallon ran out waving his arm and the cab turned sharply to the pavement, sending a lot of water over his shoes. He opened the door but couldn't help looking back. The pickpocket had lowered the umbrella to the ground upside down and was 1caning on the shaft, head low, neck bared to the sky. ""Wait,'' Mallon said to the driver. He went back and grabbed the pickpocket's sleeve and pulled him to the cab. ""Get in,"" Mallon said, and took the umbrella and pushed him into the back seat. He leaned inside. ""O. K., where do you live?"" ''No Gypsies!"" the driver said. He was twisted around, glaring at the pickpocket. ""Gypsy? Look, he's not well. I'll pay,"" Mallon added The driver shook his head. ""No Gypsies. Get him out. "" Mallon 1ooked at the driver's nameplate: Michele Kadare. ""It's the law,"" he said, ""If you don't take us. Signor Kadare. I'll report you and you'll lose your license. Believe me-I am quite serious. The driver fastened those pale eyes on Mallon and turned and put his hands on the steering wheel. He raised his eyes to the rearview mirror and he and Mallon exchanged stares. ""O. K., Mr. American."" he said. ""You pay. """	"[""The pickpocket had conflicting emotions about Mallon's help.""]"
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"Robots have come a long way since 15th century. We've got robots to build cars, carry heavy things, work in dangerous places and explore planets. But things haven't stopped there. In 1986, Honda made a robot called ASIMO. And now, it has been developed greatly. Standing at 130cm and weighing 54kg. ASIMO is very much like a small astronaut wearing a bag on the back. And he can walk, flight, climb and run fast. Isn't it wonderful? The world's first robot teacher is Saya. With her human-like face, she can show expressions like happiness, surprise, sadness, dislike, fear and she can even smile or show anger at students, which look much like a real teacher's. To do this, her rubber skin is pulled from the back with motors inside. And her eyes and mouth have wires too. She can also say some simple words like ""hello"" or ""thank you"". In the UK, the development of robots is exciting. The mini-robots will send food, clean floors, collect and throw away waste.

This passage is probably written for _ .	You want to know where the safest place for young children is in the car? For a child of any age, the back seat is the safest place and the safest part of the back seat is the middle. In the back seat, the child is farthest away from the force or effect of head-on collision , which can cause the most injuries. All fifty states of theprefix = st1 /USAhave laws requiring the use of safety seats for young children. If you have children under 8 years of age weighing no more than 80 pounds, it is necessary to fit your car with a special child safety seat. The child safety seat comes in three types or sizes: the first type is designed for babies from birth to one year of age, until the baby weighs about 20 pounds; the second size is for children between one and four years of age, who weigh between 20 and 40 pounds; the third kind is used by older children big enough to use the car's belt system. Moreover, all these safety seats must be fitted and held in place on the car's back seat. If your child does need your attention while you are driving, don't look back. Just pull over . In addition, always be sure your child is properly fastened throughout the entire trip. Children who can unfasten their own car seats are subject to fatal injuries in an accident. Start early in your child's life teaching them that car safety is serious business and make sure you give a good example and always wear your own seat belt.	['parents of small children']

Which of the following can communicate the feeling a loved one perfectly?	While many modern forms of communication like phone calls, e-mail, and letters, are extremely convenient. In my opinion, nothing beats speaking to another person face to face. The first and most obvious advantage that a face communication has over a letter and e-mail is that there is the ability to interactively converse. If the sender of a letter or an email does not write clearly, then much time must be spent to clear up the misunderstanding. In a face-to-face conversation, misunderstandings are easily dealt with because of the interactive nature of it. I would still argue that the face-to-face conversation is better because you can see the other person. Not all communication is verbal ; the meaning of much of what we say depends on our body language and the tone of voice. Joking and irony are particularly difficult to express and enjoy without seeing the expression on someone's face, or watching the movements of their body. Finally, if the goal of communication is to maintain or deepen the relationship with someone, the face-to-face communication offers the choice of communication by touch even if we could communicate by the video. Trust and respect between business partners can be established with a firm handshake. No amount of body language can convey the excitement of a high five between friends, and no number of words can communicate the comforting embrace of a loved one. Touch is the first basic method of our human relationships, before spoken language, and it is only available when people communicate face to face.	['face to face communication']
Steve will ride 900 miles in 9 days to _ .	Steve Sparks was a young successful lawyer when a bruise on one of the legs of his 3-year-old daughter changed his life. The bruise led to a doctor's visit. The doctor said his daughter was suffering from leukemia . Steve said that in a moment his life changed from what restaurant he was going to take his clients to lunch to whether his daughter Katie was ever going to see her fourth birthday. For three years Katie received a lot of treatment at the Nemours Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware and with the help of wonderful doctors, kind nurses, whom Steve and his wife Michelle called heroes, Katie's leukemia was cured . Forever changed by the experience and encouraged by the heroes at Nemours who saved his daughter's life, Steve felt he couldn't go back to business as usual. He felt there was something else he was meant to do and that something else led him to join the Nemours Foundation at the age of 28. The job change came with a 65% pay cut from what he was making as a lawyer, but Steve thought he was right and it was more important to help those who need help. Steve is glad to have made such a choice. Katie is now a healthy 20-year-old college student and Steve is one of the leaders of the Nemours Foundation. In three weeks Steve will have a party for Katie's 21st birthday, and give big thanks to the Nemours by riding his bicycle from Nemours in Jack-sonville, Florida to Wilmington, Delaware. He'll ride 900 miles in 9 days and raise $100,000 for the Nemours Foundation with the hope of saving more children's lives.	"[""raise money to save more children's lives""]"
How many dollars did young Ford earn every week? _ .	"The car was invented just a century ago. You may know all kinds of cars' names, but many people don't know who was the inventor of the first car. The first car was invented not by a German, but by an American. His name was Henry Ford. Henry was born in a poor family. He was the eldest of six children. When he was a boy, he became interested in mending watches and machines. When he was twelve years old, his mother died. Soon he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week. In the evenings he repaired watches for another dollar a week. The hard life made him strong and able. At that time there was another interest in the life of the young ford. He dreamed to make a machine. It could run without a horse, so named ""horseless carriage."" He over-came a lot of difficulties and in April 1893, the ""horseless carriage"" was finally finished. It was the first car. Later Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company . He was really the first inventor of the car in the world."	['3.5 dollars']
What is one of the most important meals of the day?	I think all of us should know it's necessary to have breakfast. It's one of the most important meals of the day. If you want to keep fit, you should have a good breakfast. Choosing the right food is also important. For it, you may have bread, eggs and milk. But in fact, many students go to school without breakfast. This does harm to their health. Maybe they say they have no time because it's too late or their parents are too busy to prepare breakfast for them. What will happen to the students on an empty stomach ? Because of no energy, they can't keep active. They may not grow fast. When they feel hungry, they are not able to study well and they have no energy to play well, either. What's worse , they will spend more time getting better once they fall ill. Therefore , we shouldn't go to school without breakfast, no matter what reason it is.	['Breakfast.']
Which of the following statements is true?	"STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan ""who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,"" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. ""In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),"" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added. Dozens of his works have been translated into English, French and Japanese and many other languages. Last year's literature prize went to Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite, established the Nobel Prizes in his will in 1895.The first awards were handed out six years later."

The place should have a lot of air. This will keep some insects away. High land with water on both sides of it is good. Then we put up our tent. We put everything into the tent, and we are ready for fun. We can swim in the lake, walk in the woods, climb a mountain, row a boat, or go fishing. In the evening we come back to the tent, we build a big fire because it can keep the insects away. We sit around the fire and talk. We may tell interesting stories or we may sing songs. At night we lie down on the grass. We can look up at the stars. It is a busy day, so we try to go to sleep early. Everything is dark. Everything is quiet.

According to the passage, reading can help people in many ways EXCEPT _ .	"Reading is very important. World Book Day falls on April 23 every year. It encourages people, especially teenagers, to discover the pleasure of reading. It is also the day to honor great writers. Many countries celebrate World Book Day. On that day, millions of school children can buy books at a much lower price than usual in any bookstore in England. It has been done every year since 1998. World Book Day is also celebrated in China. Wen Jiabao, Premier of China, is an avid reader. He does lots of reading every day though he is very busy. On World Book Day 2009, he called on people to do more reading. Wen suggested that young people should spend more time reading. ""Books can not change the world, but people can change the world by changing themselves through reading,"" he said. Reading helps us become more knowledgeable and smarter. Reading helps us to follow the latest developments of science and technology . Reading gives us information about other cultures and places in the world. Reading is also one of the most important ways to learn a foreign language like English. We all know that it is difficult to learn everything in the classroom, for example, the ways English people are living and working today can be learnt by reading.

What would be the best title for the passage?	"A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea. ""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling. The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors. The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET). Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications for the entrance exams. Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests. Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course. Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees."

The researchers are now trying to make the wristband _ .	"Smart home applications can share all kinds of helpful information with homeowners. There appears a new housing platform which can detect the stress on electricity -- and the stress on the heart. ""There is a growing population of elderly people, and there are statistics to show that more and more of them are going to live alone in the home,"" said Johann Siau, a senior lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire in the U.K., who was leading the InterHome project. The system was originally designed to provide remote access to a house so owners could be more energy-efficient. In a small type of the system, set-in controller devices connect securely to the Internet. The owner can then monitor them with a cell phone or computer. User feedback helps the system adapt to routines, saving on electricity. While thinking about responding to user behavior and an increasingly elderly population, the researchers decided to add wristband technology that senses important organs of the body such as body temperature and pulse, Siau said. ""If someone were to fall, it would detect the fall and it would immediately start the monitor of the pulse to see if the person has gone into shock ,"" he said. The wristband communicates with the home system wirelessly. Data from the band can be securely transmitted to the home network and accessed by authorized users. ""We're working on trying to reduce it to a level where it could potentially be a wrist-sized product,"" Siau said. But he warned that the technology presented new challenges. ""When you start using that on a larger scale, you have issues of privacy or security,"" he said. Siau said the InterHome home system isn't intended to invade privacy. ""We're thinking about the elderly people who are living alone with no one looking after them,"" he said. ""Hopefully this will be able to decrease some concerns and possibly save a few lives."""

In the view of _ , movement is needed when we want to know something by touching.	"Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it? Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper. Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse. ""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there."" Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works. Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations."" Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back."" Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that."" Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too."	['Susan Lederman']

In fact, you don't like it. But you won't say it. Instead, you say, "" No, thanks. I'm not hungry."" That's a white lie. Mary: Oh, I see. Thank you very much."	['die off']
The tragedy was caused by _ .	"Patricia Blues, 29, has a new aim in life: to keep drivers' hands on their steering wheels and off their cell phones. On November 2, 2007, Blues lived through a horrible experience. A motorist dialing a cell phone drove through a stop sign at 45 miles per hour and ran into the side of Blues' car. Blues' 2-year-old daughter was killed immediately in the crash. Blues has since devoted her time top pushing for laws that would prevent this type of tragedy from happening again. Cell phones are not the only distractions that cause accidents. Eating, changing CDs, reading maps, talking to passengers, and just reaching for an object on the floor can be dangerous. Therefore, the emphasis should be on educating drivers to avoid all distractions. However, talking on cell phones might be easier to regulate than eating or changing music. At least 34 states have already passed laws to restrict cell phone use in moving cars. No state has banned it yet, but several US. cities. Worldwide, 13 nations, including Australia, England, Germany, Japan and China have banned drivers' use of cell phones in moving cars. To date, no scientific evidence has been published showing that talking on the phone affects driving safety. But according to a test by some high school students, ""driving while on the phone does affect safety and probably shouldn't be done""."	"[""the motorist's absence of mind while driving""]"
Which of the following most likely indicates that there is a sad human story behind a physical change on the farm?	"When I left home for college, I sought to escape the limited world of farmers, small towns, and country life. I long for the excitement of the city, for the fast pace that rural life lacked, for adventure beyond the horizon. I dreamed of exploring the city, living within a new culture and landscape, and becoming part of the pulse of an urban jungle. Yet some of my best times were driving home, leaving the city behind and slipping back into the valley. As city life disappeared and traffic thinned, I could see the faces of the other drivers relax. Then, around a bend in the highway, the grassland of the valley would come into being, offering a view of gentle rolling hills. The land seemed permanent. I felt as if I had stepped back in time. I took comfort in the stability of the valley. Driving through small farm communities, I imagined the founding families still rooted in their grand homes, generations working the same lands, neighbors remaining neighbors for generations. I allowed familiar farmhouse landmarks to guide me. Close to home, I often turned off the main highway and took a different, getting familiar farms again and testing my memory. Friends lived in those houses. I had eaten meals and spent time there; I had worked on some of these farms, lending a hand during a peak harvest, helping a family friend for a day or two. The houses and lands looked the same, and I could picture the gentle faces and hear familiar voices as if little had been changed. As I eased into our driveway I'd return to old ways, becoming a son once again, a child on the family farm. My feelings were honest and real. How I longed for a land where life stood still and my memories could be relived. When I left the farm for college, I could only return as visitor to the valley, a traveler looking for home. Now the farm is once again my true home. I live in that farmhouse and work the permanent lands. My world may seem unchanged to casual observers, but they are wrong. I know this: if there's a constant on these farms, it's the constant of change. The good observer will recognize the differences. A farmer replants an orchard with a new variety of peaches. Irrigation is added to block of old grapes, so I imagine the vineyard has a new owner. Occasionally the changes are clearly evident, like a FOR SALE sign. But I need to read the small print in order to make sure that a bank has taken possession of the farm. Most of the changes contain two stories. One is the physical change of the farm, the other involves the people on that land, the human story behind the change. I've been back on the farm for a decade and still haven't heard all the stories behind the changes around me. But once I add my stories to the landscape, I can call this place my home, a home that continues to evolve and changes as I add more and more of my stories. A poet returns to the valley and says, ""Little has changed in the valley, and how closed-minded you all are!"" He comments about the lack of interest in sports, social and environmental issues in the poverty and inequality of our life. He was born and raised here, so he might have the right to criticize and lecture us. Yet he speaks for many who think they know the valley. How differently would others think of us if they knew the stories of a grape harvest in a wet year or a peach without a home?"	['A piece of land is being sold by a bank.']
What is the best title of the text?	"The US government has started a website, Admongo, to help children think critically about the advertising aimed at them. It claims to provide visitors with an ""education"" through games and other amusement. A cartoon man dressed in old time pilot clothing greets visitors to Admongo. ""Call me Haiz"", he says upon arrival in a rocket ship that opens up with a crazy world inside it. Spacey dance music plays in the background as Haiz tells visitors that they need to learn about advertising. Its inventors say eight to twelve years old is the age kids develop their critical thinking abilities. Kids that age are also a big market for advertisers. The idea behind Admongo is to teach children three things: To _ the advertiser. To know what the advertiser is really saying. And to know what the advertisement is trying to get the child to do. Children learn these things through a video game. They create their own game character. They can choose different skin colors, hair styles, eye and mouth shapes. Then they begin a trip through ad-land, where there are ads on buses and billboards. The players have to find all the marketing in the neighborhood before they can move on to the next level. The Admongo game takes players inside a home, to the advertising studio and everywhere else ads can be found. It is a complete exploration of the world of marketing. One such area is food marketing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says it is a big business. The FTC estimates that food, drink and fast-food restaurants spent more than one and a half billion dollars on advertising to young people in 2010. The FTC says children are important for three reasons. They buy products. They influence parents and caregivers to buy. And they are the future adult buyers of the products. A recent study says most advertising aimed at children is for foods of the lowest nutritional value. First Lady Michelle Obama has said she would like to see advertisers marketing healthy foods for children."	['An education website for children']

What's the best title for the passage?	"If cars had wings, they could fly and that just might happen, beginning in 2012.The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its carplane, the Transition, to customers by the end of 2012. "" It's the next 'wow' vehicle,"" said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh.""Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly."" The car plane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land. The Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is both.The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National High way Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations. The company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly.They say it saves you the trouble of trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go.When you land, you fold up the wings and hit the road.There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an air port-you park it in the garage at home. The carplane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet.It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers.Terrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under bad weather instead of flying into marginal conditions. The Transition's price tag: $ 194,000.But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, transponder or GPS.Another option is a fullplane parachute. ""If you get into a very awful situation, it is the necessary safety option,""Gersh said. So far, the company has more than 70 0rders with deposits. ""We're working very closely with them, but there are still some remaining steps, "" Brown said."	['Cars With Wings May Be Just Around The Comer']
What can we infer from the passage?	We can achieve knowledge either actively or passively . We achieve it actively by direct experience, by testing and proving an idea, or by reasoning. We achieve knowledge passively by being told by someone else. Most of the learning that takes place in the classroom and the kind that happens when we watch TV or read newspapers or magazines is passive. Conditioned as we are to passive learning, it's not surprising that we depend on _ in our everyday communication with friends and co-workers* Unfortunately, passive learning has a serious problem. It makes us tend to accept what we are told even when it is little more than hearsay and rumor . Did you ever play the game Rumor? It begins when one person writes down a message but doesn't show it to anyone. Then the person whispers it, word for word, to another person. That person, in turn, whispers it to still another, and so on, through all the people playing the game. The last person writes down the message word for word as he or she hears it. Then the two written statements are compared Typically, the original message has changed. That's what happens in daily life. The simple fact that people repeat a story in their own words changes the story. Then, too, most people listen imperfectly. And many enjoy adding their own creative touch to a story, trying to improve on it, stamping it with their own personal style. Yet those who hear it think they know. This process is also found among scholars and authors:A statement of opinion by one writer may be re-stated as fact by another, who may in turn be quoted by yet another; and this process may continue, unless it occurs to someone to question the facts on which the original writer based his opinion or to challenge the interpretation he placed upon those facts.

.The writer came to understand the real meaning of fishing _ .	"John Steinbeck once said, ""All Americans believe they are born fishermen. For a man to admit to a distaste in fishing would be like denouncing mother - love or hating moonlight."" I can't say that I'm the biggest John Steinbeck fan. Actually, the only thing I can ever remember reading by him was ""The pearl"" when I was in middle school, but I couldn't agree more with the man when it comes to fishing. Whether I am on a boat in the middle of the Lay Lake, fishing off the shores of the Florida Keys for tarpon or catching rainbow trout in the Shoshone River of Wyoming, fishing is my life. According to the American Sports Fishing Association, the fishing industry brings in more than $ 116 billion per year from fishermen across the country. Though a beautiful picture to imagine, fishing is much more than that. Fishing is a way of life for many people and a way to escape everyday stress. Being a fisherman makes me a member of a wonderful group of people extending to all walks of life. Even President Obama can be found fishing on his farm in Texas with his good friend Roland Martin when the job gets too stressful. I can remember fishing with my grandfather when I was 5 years old on his boat at Lake Mitchell. Although I didn't understand what I was doing, I did know that my grandfather was happy and that made me happy. Since then I've spent the past 16 years on the rivers and lakes of Alabama. After days of practice, before and after work, I slowly developed an understanding of fishing. My boss, Ric Horst, took me back to the Shoshone, and I managed to bring in a 19-inch cutthroat trout. Fishing with Ric was a life-changing experience for me. He not only showed me how to fish correctly, but also told me how fishing could be a way to escape your problems. Since then, prime-time season seems to take forever to arrive. Now, with the ending of February and beginning of March in sight, the excitement of heading out Lake Tuscaloosa or Lake Lurleen before classes and catching something has finally returned."

From the passage we know _ .	"My neighbor Mrs. Gargan first told me about it. ""Have you seen the tree?"" She asked as I was sitting in the backyard enjoying the autumn twilight . ""The one down at the corner,"" she explained. ""It's a beautiful tree--all kinds of colors. All the passers-by stop to have a look. You ought to see it."" I told her I would, but I soon forgot about the tree. Three days later, I was jogging down the street when a splash of bright orange caught my eyes. For an instant, I thought someone's house had caught fire. Then I remembered the tree. I approached the tree to look at it closely. There was nothing remarkable about the shape of the tree. It was a medium-sized maple. But Mrs. Gargan had been right about its colors. Like the mess of an artist's palette , the tree blazed a bright crimson on its lower branches and burned with vivid yellows and oranges in its center, and deep red at its top. Through these colors were light green leaves as yet untouched by autumn. Walking closer I noticed several bare branches near the top, their small black branches scratching the air like claws. The fallen leaves lay like a red carpet around the trunk. As I was amazed at this beauty, I thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson's comments about the stars. ""If the constellations appeared only once in a thousand years, imagine what an exciting event it would be. But because they're up there every night, we barely give them a look,"" he made a remark in Nature. I felt the same way about the tree. Because its beauty will last only a week, it should be especially precious to us. And I had almost missed it. Once in the 19th century when a man noticed a brilliant display of northern lights in the sky over Massachusetts, he rang a church bell to alert the whole town's people. That's what I felt like doing about the tree. I wanted to awake the countryside to its wonder. I didn't have a church bell, but as I walked home, I did ask each neighbor I passed the same simple but important question Mrs. Gargan had asked me: ""Have you seen the tree?""."

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	It's in the 2010s.You feel sick, so you go to the doctor. She checks your fever, looks at your throat, and asks what you've been thinking about lately. When you leave, she gives you some medicine, but also a list of thinking skills that you are supposed to practice daily. She says that the way you think is causing some of your illness. Doctors and other scientists who study the human mind and try to explain why people act in the way that they do, called psychologists , are starting to believe it. You know that your brain is connected to every part of your body through your nervous system . Now scientists have proved that how you think and feel can have an influence on the health of your body. Stress is caused whenever there is a problem or a change in your life. Of course, everybody has stress more or less; nobody's life is perfect. In fact, stress is necessary. Without stress, we would never learn anything or grow or change. We would probably be bored to death. But too much stress can hurt you. It can weaken your body's protection so that you are more likely to catch diseases. It can even make you more likely to have an accident. When you feel stressed, your brain sends a message to your body to produce a chemical called adrenaline . Adrenaline speeds up your breathing and your heartbeat. Today you have a different kind of stress. Problems like endless homework or troubles with your family are the kind of things you can't fight or run away from, so you don't use up all that adrenaline. It just stays bottled up inside you, and that's what can do something bad to you. What can you do about stress? First, you can try to find ways to change things so you aren't under so much stress. You can set up a plan to finish homework or go to a doctor or a psychologist to try to work things out with your family or your friends. But sometimes you can't change a stressful situation. Sometimes you don't even want to. _ The link between your body and brain works in two ways. Your body can help your mind deal with stress. If you are under stress, you need to take especially good care of your body. It's important to get enough sleep and eat nutritious meals. Some people take a vitamin-mineral pill every day. Another thing that you can do is daily exercise. If you go walking or do aerobic dancing or work out at the gym , you give your body a chance to burn up some of that adrenaline. Of course, a person who isn't used to much physical activity should start slowly. Anyone with a continuing physical problem should check with a doctor before starting any exercise programs.	['Everyone needs stress to improve himself.']
What is not mentioned in the passage?	Be positive about school! Don`t say things are difficult or boring. Be interested in school life and your school subjects. Join lots of activities. Be quick to put your hand up. Go round the school with a big smile. Expect to work. School is not a holiday camp. If you are not working, you are not learning, and you are wasting your time at school. Teachers cannot make everything enjoyable. Keep fit. If you do not eat a good breakfast, you will be thinking about food in class. If you go to bed late and do not have enough sleep, you will be sleepy in class. Play some sports to keep your body strong. Don`t be too disappointed if things sometimes go badly. Everyone _ some tests, lose some matches and has bad days. Friends are not always perfect, and they sometimes say and do unpleasant things. Don`t let small problems seem very big and important. Talk about problems. Sometimes they are only the result of misunderstanding. Don`t be too embarrassed to ask for help. You are young. No one thinks you can do everything.	['camp']
What have researchers found out about the influence of parents and the school on children's intelligence?	As researchers learn more about how children's intelligence develops, they are increasingly surprised by the power of parents.The power of the school has been replaced by the home.To begin with, all the factors which are part of intelligence--the child's understanding of language,learning patterns, curiosity--are established well before the child enters school at the age of six.Study after study has shown that even after school begins, children's achievements have been far more influenced by parents than by teachers.This is particularly true about learning that is languagerelated.The school rather than the home is given credit for variations in achievement in subjects such as science. In view of their power, it's sad to see so many parents not making the most of their child's intelligence.Until recently parents had been warned by educators who asked them not to educate their children.Many teachers now realize that children cannot be educated only at school and parents are being asked to contribute both before and after the child enters school. Parents have been particularly afraid to teach reading at home.Of course,children shouldn't be pushed to read by their parents, but educators have discovered that reading is best taught individually--and the easiest place to do this is at home.Many fourand fiveyearolds who have been shown a few letters and taught their sounds will compose single words of their own with them even before they have been taught to read.	['Parents and the school have the equal power.']
What plays a key role in solving a math problem?	"New research shows how kids' brains reorganize as they learn math. All the time you spent memorizing multiplication tables may have made you a better mathematician, according to a new study. A team of scientists from Stanford University, in California, have shown how the brain reorganizes itself as kids learn math. After a certain amount of time spent practicing math, kids can put away the calculator . They don't even need to count on their fingers. They simply know the answers to subtraction , addition, and multiplication facts. The quicker kids can recall basic math facts, the easier it is for them to solve more complicated math problems. The Stanford University researchers observed the brain activity of 28 students aged 7to 9 for the study. They took scans of the students' brains as the students solved math calculations without the help of a calculator, pen or paper. A calculation--three plus four equals seven, for example--flashed on a screen. The students pushed a button to say if the answer was right or wrong. The scientists also recorded the response speed, and what parts of the brain became active as the kids pushed the button. These observations showed a process called fact retrieval . Rather than using their fingers to count, or writing out answers on a piece of paper, the students pulled the answers from memory. It's as if the answers to basic math problems are kept in a long-term storage area in the brain, which was built from repetition. ""Experience really does matter,"" said Dr. Kathy Mann Koepeke. Children make the shift from counting to fact retrieval when they are 8 to 9 years old, the study shows. This is the time when most students are learning basic addition and subtraction. When kids have basic math facts memorized, the brain has more free space to learn more complicated math. This process has benefits for the future. The study shows as kids grow older, their answers rely more on memory and become quicker and more accurate. Less brain activity is devoted to counting. Some children make this shift quicker than others."	['Experience']
The author went to a quiet canal-side cafe to _ .	"My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman. A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup. The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, ""I hope that helps a bit."" I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did. I placed some money in the woman's cup and continued my travels, light-hearted after witnessing such an astute act of caring."	['get away from the crowds']
"The word ""comb"" in the passage means _ ."	At 2:30 December 5, 1945, five US Navy training planes took off in clear weather from the base Lauderdale, Florida. The planes flew east over the coast... and disappeared. The group was Flight 19, on a run between Florida and Bahamas. Tailor was the group leader. At about 3:40, Tailor reported that his compasses were not reading properly. The other planes followed their leaders aimlessly, first east, then west, then northeast over the ocean, as Tailor tried to make sure of the direction by radio. Then, suddenly Tailor was heard to give orders to dive... Quickly, two giant Martin seaplanes were sent up to search for Flight 19. Several hours later, the wind became strong and visibility dropped. A return to base was ordered. But only one of the Martin seaplanes landed. Four days later, the Navy and Coast Guard _ a 100,000 square--mile area with more than 100 planes and ships. No sign was ever shown of the missing planes. Today, people have noted the disappearance of many ships and planes in the southwest part of the North Atlantic and began to call this area the Bermuda Triangle. The points of the triangle are Bermuda, Puerto Rico and a particular place in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Florida. It is a two--faced water world of tiny islands, bright beaches and beautiful waters. Yet thick fogs, powerful currents and sudden storms are hidden behind this smiling surface.	['search all over']
Monarchs are kept as heads of state in Europe mostly	"King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted ""kings don't give up the throne , they die in their sleep."" But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyles? The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarized, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above mere politics and symbolize a spirit of national unity. It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs continuing popularity as heads of state. And so, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch- filled region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). Most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure. Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history and sometimes the way they behave today symbolizes outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is strange that wealthy noble families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states. The most successful monarchies try their best to abandon or hide their old noble ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media interference makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image."

Which of the following is TRUE about Alabama and music?	"There are 67 counties in the state of Alabama.Each county is rich with history and its own unique stories.Colbert County, located in the northwest corner of the state, has its share of exciting stories and claims to statewide fame.The county was created on February 6, 1867, and Tuscumbia became the county seat (the town in which the offices of the county government are located). One of the most famous residents of Tuscumbia was Helen Keller.Helen Keller was born on June 27, 1880.Her home was a white frame cottage built by her grandparents.Since ivy grew everywhere, the house was called Ivy Green.It was here, at the water pump in the backyard, that Keller learned the word ""w-a-t-e-r"" with the help of her teacher, Anne Sullivan.Visitors to Ivy Green can walk under boxwood trees that are 150 years old.The home has furniture that the Keller family used.It also has Keller's Braille books and her original Braille typewriter. Spring Park is Tuscumbia's most popular park and favorite tourist attraction.This park has the world's largest manufactured waterfall called Coldwater Falls.The Spring Park Light and Water Show is an amazing sight to see.It takes place every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at sundown.The water appears to dance to music and colored lights.The music played during the show is recorded by singers and musicians from Alabama.

According to the research,which kind of colleagues would most people tend to choose?	Camaraderie over Competence The importance of liking people is the subject of an article in the Harvard Business Review,which has carried out an experiment to find out who we'd rather work with.Hardly surprisingly,the people we want most as our workmates are both:brilliant at their jobs and delightful human beings.And the people we want least are both unpleasant and useless.More interestingly,the authors found that,given the choice between working with lovable fools and competent jerks ,we irresistibly choose the former.Anyway,who likes those stupid men who annoy or hurt other people?We might insist that competence matters more,but our behavior shows we stay close to the people we like and sharing information with them. What companies should therefore do is get people to like each other more.The trick here is apparently to make sure staffs come across each other as often as possible during the day.They also should be sent on bonding courses and so on to encourage friendliness and break down displeasure.However,more outdoor-activity weekends and shared coffee machines inspire no confidence at all. The reality is that people either like each other or they don't.You can't force it.Possibly you can make offices friendlier by tolerating a lot of chat,but there is a productivity cost to that.In my experience,the question of lovable fool against competent jerk may not be the right one.The two are interrelated:we tend not to like our workmates when they are completely hopeless.I was once quite friendly with a woman whom I later worked with.I found her to be so outstandingly bad at her job that I lost respect for her and ended up not really liking her at all.Then is there anything that companies should be doing about it? By far the most effective strategy would be to hire people who are all pretty much the same,given that similarity is one of the main determinants of whether we like each other.I think this is a pretty good idea,but no one dares recommend this anymore without offending the diversity lobby group.There is only one acceptable view on this subject:teams of similar people are bad because they stop creativity.This may be true,though I have never seen any conclusive proof of it. Not only do we like similar people,we like people who like us.So if companies want to promote more liking,they should encourage a culture where we are all nice to each other.The trouble is that this needs to be done with some skill.

Which of the following involves political tricks?	"Legends about the development of coffee are varied and interesting, involving chance occurrences, political tricks, and the pursuit of wealth and power. According to one story, a sheepherder named Kaldi, as he tended his sheep, noticed the effect of coffee beans. He noticed that the sheep became excited after eating the red ""cherries"" from a certain plant when they changed pastures . He tried it himself, and was soon as overactive as his sheep. Another story relates that a monk happened to discover that this fruit from the shiny green plant could help him stay awake. Another legend gives us the name for coffee, ""mocha"". Omar, an Arabian was thrown to the desert with his followers to die of starvation. In desperation, Omar had his friends boil and eat the fruit from an unknown plant. Not only did the soup save the group, but the residents of the nearest town, Mocha, took their survival as a religious sign. The plant and its beverage were named Mocha to honor this event. Coffee was introduced much later to countries beyond Arabia, whose inhabitants believed it to be a tasty thing and guarded its secret as if they were top secret military plans. The government forbade transportation of the plant out of the Moslem nations. The actual spread of coffee was started illegally. One Arab named Baba Budan smuggled beans to some mountains near Mysore, India, and started a farm there. Early in this century, some of those original plants were found still growing fruitfully in the region. Coffee today is grown and enjoyed worldwide, and is one of the few crops that small farmers in third-world countries can profitably export."	"[""Baba Budan's story.""]"
The bottom of the fence should extend about 15 centimeters into the ground because _ .	The United States Department of Agriculture has a program called Wildlife Services. Its job is to help protect agricultural and other resources from threats and damage by wildlife. Often that means helping farmers deal with unwelcome visitors. This organization has experts from different fields and it has set up thousands of inquiry agencies all over the country where farmers can explain their difficulty and get practical help. ks5u One example from Wildlife Services of its work involved a farmer in Washington State, in the Pacific Northwest. Several years ago, thousands of Canada geese landed on his fields. The geese began to eat his carrot crop. Biologists from the program suggested that the farmer use noise-making devices and other measures to scare the large birds away. These efforts apparently succeeded, which made the farmer quite happy. Wildlife Services also has a livestock protection program. The program just offers suggestions to keep those _ away instead of killing them. The Wildlife Services program is part of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. APHIS offers some suggestions of ways to keep away predators .For example, try to keep food and water safe from wildlife. Fences may help keep out coyotes , especially if the fences are at least two meters high. For best results, the bottom of the fence should extend about fifteen centimeters into the ground. Experts suggest providing secure shelter for chickens, sheep and other animals that could be attacked. The experts also suggest using lights above places where animals are kept. And they advise people who see coyotes around their property to chase them away by shouting, making loud noises or throwing rocks. For home gardeners, a two-meter fence might help keep out deer. To keep out rabbits, a wire fence has to be only about a half-meter high. It should extend fifteen centimeters underground to keep rabbits from digging under it. If snakes are a problem, remove dead trees and cut high grass to destroy their hiding places. And to protect livestock, consider using guard animals such as dogs and donkeys, which are very effective. Due to its effective work, ever since the Wildlife Services was started, it has been well received by farmers all over the States and neighboring countries such as Canada and Mexico.

Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?	Most people are aware that outdoor air pollution can damage their health,but many do not know that indoor air pollution can also have significant health effects.Environmental Protection Agency studies indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be 3~5 times,and occasionally more than 100 times,higher than outdoor levels.These levels of indoor air pollutants may be of particular concern because most people spend about 90% of their time indoors. There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home.These include sources such as oil,gas,coal,wood,and tobacco products,building materials,wet or damp carpet,and furniture made of certain pressed wood products,products for household cleaning and maintenance,personal care,or hobbies,central heating and cooling systems. Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures.These include _ of the eyes,nose,and throat,headaches,dizziness.Such immediate effects are usually shortterm and treatable.Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution,if it can be identified. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors.Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences.In other cases,whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity,which varies tremendously from person to person.Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures,and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well. Certain immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases,so it is often difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution.While pollutants commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects,there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems.People also react very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants.Therefore,further research is needed to better understand the effects of indoor air pollution and to find efficient ways to protect our health.

Good friends need to _ .	In choosing a friend,one should be very careful.A good friend can help you study.You can have fun together and make each other happy.Sometimes you will meet fair weather friends.They will be with you as long as you have money or luck,but when you are down,they will run away.How do I know when I have found a good friend?I look for certain qualities of character,especially understanding,honesty and reliability . Above all,I look for understanding in a friend.A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling.He is not quick to judge.Instead,he tries to learn from others.He puts himself in the other person's place,and he tries to think of ways to be helpful.He is also a good listener. At the same time,however,a good friend is honest.He does not look for faults in others.He notices their good points.In short,a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability.I can always depend on a good friend.If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time,I can be sure that he will be there.If I need a favor,he will do his best to help me.If I am in trouble,he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special.A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun.We should enjoy our lives,and we would enjoy our friendship.That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with.A good friend likes the same things I like.We share experience and learn from each other.A good friend has a good sense of humor ,too.He likes to laugh with me.That is how we share in the joy of being friends.And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable,honest,and understanding,I know I've found a friend!	"[""understand each other's feelings""]"

According to the text, Martha _ .	Every day, 15-year-old Martha wrote on the Internet about the meal she ate at school. She also took pictures of the food. However, Martha was very honest about the food. She did not just describe the food. She judged the taste and health of the food. Martha also began to use her blog for an important reason. She began to raise money for the organization Mary's Meals in the East African country of Malawi. It provides food for children in schools for free. Martha encouraged her readers to send money to Mary's Meals to help build a kitchen. But then, Martha began to have a problem. Many people read her blog. She became big news. The news stories showed that the food at Martha's school was not always healthy. And that made some people angry. So the school officials decided to stop Martha's blog. They said that she could not take her camera to school. But an amazing thing happened. Many people began sending messages of support across the Internet. Martha's story was even bigger than before. Now the officials had to change their minds. A few days later, Martha was again writing her blog. But more than that, people had sent a lot of money for the Malawi school children. Martha had hoped to raise about 10,000 dollars. But the total reached 100,000 dollars and still kept on growing! Martha's blog also helped to improve meals at her school. One day she wrote: As we waited for dinner we were told that we are allowed to eat as much fruit and bread as we want. No one knows what will happen to Martha's blog in future. But already this little girl has helped to change the eating experience of many children just by sharing on the Internet pictures of her school meals.	['got a lot of support around the world']
What is a special animal in Chinese people?	"Lion is a special animal to Chinese people. A couple of stone lions, a male and a female , can often be seen in front of the gates of old buildings. The male lion is on the left with his right paw on a ball, and the female on the right. And her left paw is touching a baby animal. The lion is the king in the animal world because he is powerful. The ball shows the country or the family will be together forever, and the baby animal with the female shows that you will have many children. The stone lions were also used to show the families were powerful. If you had no money or power, you couldn't put the stone lions in front of your houses. It was also popular to make bridges with stone lions. The best known of this is the Lugou Bridge (also as Marco Polo Bridge), built from 1189 to 1192. The stone lions on the bridge are most famous. Maybe there are 485 lions in all, maybe there are 498 or 501. A famous saying is that ""the lions on the Lugou Bridge are uncountable ."""	['Lion.']
The author's main purpose in writing the passage is to_.	Feeling tired? Under too much stress? Well, you may want to try Yoga . It's what more and more people have been turning to to release the trouble of modern life. Practically unheard of in the West until 50 years ago, Yoga has become one of the most popular health trends around the world, including prefix = st1 /China. If you search for Yoga on line in Chinese, lots of pages are there to see, most of which are main pages of Yoga clubs. In order to keep fit and lose weight, many girls spend more than 1000 yuan taking part in Yoga classes every month. However, are you really ready for it? There are several things you need to know before you really take it. First, do not force your body too much. Yoga has many difficult poses. They are beautiful and worth boasting if you could finish them. But if you force yourself to do as exactly as an experienced Yoga teacher does, you may hurt your body, instead of strengthening it. Do you remember you original purpose for playing Yoga? It is self -building, not competing. Second, do some research about the Yoga class that you are to registering. Yoga is new in Chinaand there are not so many certificated well-trained Yoga teachers. Some not well organized clubs just find someone learn a little Yoga and certificate them. But be aware, a non- _ teacher might wrongly guide you and you could not benefit from the classes much except that they force you to exercise your body a bit. Considering about the large amount of money you invest in it, it's worth and reasonable to make sure the teachers in the club are qualified before you join. Third, it would be better to learn something about nutrition when you practice Yoga. In the very beginning, Yoga was part of the Vedas, bible of the traditional Indian philosophy. So it could be regarded as a kind of lifestyle. When you have decided to care for your body, why not feed it properly? In fact, good clubs have their own nutritionists. Anyhow, make sure you are ready before you act. The fashion may change quickly. But what benefits is still good for us.	['give people some advice on taking part in Yoga classes']
According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?	"Fifty has never looked better. It's been 50 years since the first James Bond film, Dr. No, premiered in cinemas. As first embodied by Scottish actor Sean Connery, Agent 007 was a fearless, cool-as-ice spy who excelled at sleuthing , fighting and saving the world. Since then, more than 20 films featuring the iconic spy have been released-making it one of the longest-running franchises in the history of cinema. On Nov 9, the 23rd Bond movie, Skyfall, celebrated the legend's 50th birthday. Over the years, audiences have changed. It doesn't matter. Six different actors have acted 007 and it doesn't matter. Even shocking technological and cultural changes can't bend Bond. Why? Is it the action, the sexy women, the cars, the gadgets and the exotic locations? Yes, but the most important reason is still the man himself. Bond can challenge his boss and shoot a bad guy in mere minutes. He is an expert in literature, languages, art and fine wines. He has a sharp tongue besides his wits. In the first film Dr. No, as Connery lit a cigarette, we heard James Bond's voice and saw his cafe for the first time. The simple scene and short phrase have defined the character for half a century. ""Next to the Beatles and Stones, James Bond was the greatest British import of the 1960s,"" David Kamp, a US contributing editor for Vanity Fair, wrote in a recent article about the birth of Bond and its influence on the US. The Bond phenomenon has clearly affected movie culture, pop culture and spy culture. But perhaps the most amazing thing is that 007 has survived in the age of feminism . ""Talking of objectifying women, Bond is essential Huge Henfner (founder of Playboy magazine) with a gun,"" movie critic Xan Brooks told The Guardian. ""But women liked Bond, too. He couldn't have run for 50 years with male fans alone."" We love Bond for many reasons--after all 50 years, Bond is still breathtaking. thrilling ride into the very heart of an icon like no other. But most of all, we may love him for one reason: ""he always gets away with it."" one said."	['The James Bond film was popular in the age of feminism.']
What did the couple do over the course of Our Green Year?	Going green seems to be fad for a lot of people these days. Whether that is good or bad, we can't really say, but for the tow of us, going green is not a fad but a lifestyle. On April22, 2011, we decided to go green every single day for an entire year. This meant doing 365 different green things, and it also meant challenging ourselves to go green beyond easy things. Rather than recycle and reduce our energy, we had to think of 365 different green things to do and this was no easy task. With the idea of going green every single day for a year, Our Green Year started. My life and I decided to educate people about how they could go green in their lives and hoped we could show people all the green things that could be done to help the environment. We wanted to push the message that every little bit helps. Over the course of Our Green Year, we completely changed our lifestyle. We now shop at organic stores. We consume less meat, choosing green food. We have greatly reduced our buying we don't need. We have given away half of what we owned through websites. Our home is kept clean by vinegar and lemon juice, with no chemical cleaners. We make our own butter, enjoying the smell of home-made fresh bread. In our home office anyone caught doing something ungreen might be punished. Our minds have been changed by Our Green Year. We are grateful for the chance to have been able to go green and educate others. We believe that we do have the power to change things and help our planet.

With the device, the reader is able to _ .	Dear Customers, I love slipping into a comfortable chair for a long read--as I relax into the chair, I also relax into the author's words, stories and ideas. The physical book is so elegant that it disappears into the background, and what remains is the author's world. Today, we at Amazon are excited to announce Mindle, a wireless, portable reading device with instant access to more than 90,000 books, magazines and newspapers. We've been working on Mindle for more than three years. Our top design objective was for Mindle to disappear in your hands--to get out of the way--so you can enjoy your reading. We also wanted to go beyond the physical book. Mindle is wireless, so whether you're lying in bed or riding a train, you can think of a book, and have it in less than 60 seconds. No computer is needed--you do your reading directly from the device. We chose the same wireless technology used in advanced mobile phones. But unlike mobile phones, there are no monthly wireless bills, no service or data plans, and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install (,). We want you to get lost in your reading and not in the technology. Mindle uses a new kind of display called electronic paper. Sharp and natural with no strong light, reading on Mindle is nothing like reading from a computer screen. Mindle weighs only 10.3 ounces--less than paperback--but can carry two hundred books. Enjoy learning about Mindle and many thanks! Jeff Bezos Founder & CEO	['get rid of heavy books made of paper']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"In the near future, we may be using our eyes to operate our smartphones and tablets, even when it comes to playing popular games like Fruit Ninja. The GazeGroup has been developing eye-controlled computer technology for nearly 20 years. But those devices have been mainly designed to aid those with disabilities, and are very expensive. ""After a while, we figured out that probably the best way is to go for a mass-market approach,"" says Gaze's Sune Alstrup Johansen, ""where everybody would have this available."" Johansen and some of his colleagues have formed a new company, The Eye Tribe, which is hoping to develop the technology on a mass commercial level. The technology works by sending an infrared light from the computing device toward the user's face. After measuring the user's eye movements, the technology is then able to easily know where a person's eyes are moving, allowing the eyes to control a cursor . A software can determine the location of the eyes and tell where the user is looking on the screen. It even knows which image he is looking at. There has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world. Following Nintendo's popular Wii system, Xbox released the Kinect device, which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands, legs and voices. Since most smartphones and other mobile devices can't come standard with an infrared device, Johansen said a replaceable filter would be an inexpensive, convenient choice for most consumers. And even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create a commercially practical product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for disabled users. ""Then I can go to any computer, and then I can control it and I can use it, instead of just bringing my own,"" said Stig Langvad, who heads up Denmark's umbrella organization for people with disabilities. ""So I'll be a part of society on an equal foot, instead of being a special solution."""	['the development of eye-controlled computer technology began a very long time ago']
The reason why the author offered a lift to the elderly man was that _ .	"In 1978, I was 18 and was working as a nurse in a small town about 270 km away from Sydney, Australia. I was looking forward to having five days off from duty. Unfortunately, the only one train a day back to my home in Sydney had already left. So I thought I'd hitch a ride . I waited by the side of the highway for three hours but no one stopped for me. Finally, a man walked over and introduced himself as Gordon. He said that although he couldn't give me a lift, I should come back to his house for lunch. He noticed me standing for hours in the November heat and thought I must be hungry. I was doubtful as a young girl but he assured(...) me I was safe, and he also offered to help me find a lift home afterwards. When we arrived at his house, he made us sandwiches. After lunch, he helped me find a lift home. Twenty-five years later, in 2003, while I was driving to a nearby town one day, I saw an elderly man standing in the glaring heat, trying to hitch a ride. I thought it was another chance to repay someone for the favor I'd been given decades earlier. I pulled over and picked him up. I made him comfortable on the back seat and offered him some water. After a few moments of small talk, the man said to me, ""You haven't changed a bit, even your red hair is still the same."" I couldn't remember where I'd met him. He then told me he was the man who had given me lunch and helped me find a lift all those years ago. It was Gordon."	['she wanted to repay the favor she once got']
_ of Pei's structures have won awards.	On this vivid planet, it appears color1ful with many world famous buildings. Among these largest artificial articles in the world, many were designed by the same architect--Ieoh Ming Pei. Pei, the 1983 Laureate of the Pritzker, Architecture Prize, is a founding partner of I. M. Pei & Partners based in New York City. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a banker. He came to the United States in 1935 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Graduate School of Design (M. Arch. 1946). From 1945 to 1948, Pei taught at Harvard. In 1948 he accepted the newly created post of director of Architecture at Webb & Knapp, Inc., and this association resulted in major architectural and planning projects in big cities. In 1958, he formed the partnership of I. M. Pei & Associates, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966. The partnership received the 1968 Architectural Firm Award of The American Institute of Architects. Pei has designed over forty projects in the world, twenty of which have been award winners. His outstanding projects have included the East Building of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library near Boston; the Fragrant Hill Hotel near Beijing, China. Pei is now a member of the National Council on the Arts, and before served on the National Council on the Humanities. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, he was awarded the MIT Traveling Fellowship, at Harvard. He later won a lot of honors. In 1982, the deans of the architectural schools of America chose I. M. Pei as the best designer of significant non-residential structures.	['Twenty']
To get the job you want, during the interview you should _ .	The interview is an important event in the job-hunting process, because the 20 or 30 minutes you spend with the interviewer may decide whether or not you get the particular job you want. Therefore, it is important to remember that your purpose during the interview may differ from that of the potential employer. You want to make yourself stand out as a whole person who has personal strengths and should be considered the right person for the job. It is encouraging to know that the interviewer's task is not to embarrass you, but to hire the right person for the job. Remember, job-hunting is very competitive. Anything you can do to improve your interview techniques will be to your advantage. The following suggestions may help you land the most important job. Your goal in this interview is to make sure your good points get across. The interviewer won't know them unless you point them out, so try to do this in a factual and sincere manner. Don't say anything bad about your former employers. If you have been fired from a job and the interview asks about it, be honest. Show the interviewer that you are interested in the company by asking questions. Ask about responsibilities, working conditions, promotion opportunities and benefits of the job you are interviewing for. If at some point you decide the interview is not going well, do not let your discouragement show. You have nothing to lose by continuing a show of confidence, and you many have much to gain. It may be real, or it may be a test to see how you react to _ conditions. Some interviewers may bring up salary early in the interview. At this time, you may indicate that you are more interested in a job where you can prove yourself than a specific salary. This politely passes the question back to the interviewer. If possible, you should negotiate for salary after you have been offered a job and have completed the paperwork.	['make yourself stand out as the right person for the job']
"It can be inferred that the film ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is _ ."	"""How to Train Your Dragon"" by British author Cressida Cowell is one of the best pieces of children's literature. A child can make a whole alternative universe with a vivid imagination and Toothless, the hero's hunting dragon, thus turning a rainy day into an adventure of a lifetime. However, if you have never read the book but instead choose to see the film version, you might think you were seeing a new-age war movie meant for adults rather than children. Let's look at ""Where the Wild Things Are"" for further discussion. The story centers around a lonely eight-year-old boy named Max, who sails away to an island. Creatures living there declare Max their king. What an amazing piece of children's literature! A treasure for every child's library. Yet, children were crying in the movie theatre. Owls were falling from the sky, chicken's arms were being torn off, and a child was running around a dark abandoned world fighting evil as the only human. It was almost as if Hollywood could not imagine children enjoying a movie for its basic literature content. Hollywood might be right. But more and more its audiences are complaining that there is an increased amount of violence in children's stories today than in the past. While there appears to be a trend in our society to make more violence more accessible to younger children, books and literature are generally an exception. I truly believe that children's literature has become more vivid, and more colorful. This is a great treasure for the children, and is certainly not violent. What has changed the children's stories of today is not the writers, but the film industry. In some way, children's literature is just being strangely twisted. I wonder how much influence the author have over this."	['frightening']
What changed Antonia's way of life?	Antonia left Athens and came to America to make her fortune. She wanted to be a famous actress, so she went to live in Hollywood, California. At first, Antonia had very little money, so she was forced to watch every penny while _ of movie agents' offices. For over a year, she worked only in small parts. She found life extremely hard. She had to take buses or walk everywhere, and she ate only one meal a day. Even though she worked nights as a waitress, Antonia could not really make ends meet. Suddenly, one day, the star of a film became ill, and the director asked Antonia to take the part. Her acting was superb. After the first show of the film, she became an overnight success. Everyone gave her mad notice, and she received many offers for future starring roles. Since then, Antonia has changed her whole way of life. Now she wears expensive furs and drives a Rolls-Royce. She lives in a twenty-seven room house in Beverly Hills, with seven servants. All her needs are cared for. For Antonia, America is truly the land of streets paved with gold. Through her hard work, she has earned the fame she desired so much.	['Her superb acting.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	From a plane we can see the fields, cities, mountains or seas below. If we go into space, we see more and more of the earth. People and man-made satellites have been sent out into space to look at the earth carefully and people have learnt more about the earth in the last few years. The sea looks very beautiful when the sun is shining on it. But it can be very terrible when there is a strong wind. The sea is very big. It nearly covers three quarters of the earth. The sea is also very deep in some places. There is one place and at that place the sea is about 11 kilometers deep. The highest mountain in the world is about 9 kilometers high. If that mountain was put into the sea at that place, there would be still 2 kilometers of water above it! In most parts of the sea, there are many kinds of fishes and plants. Some live near the top of the sea. Others live deep down. There are also a lot of small living things, and lots of fishes live by eating them. The sea can be very cold. When people go down, the sea becomes colder and colder. Only some men can go down into the deep sea. But, in 1970, five women scientists lived in the deep sea for fourteen days.	['The highest mountain is in the deepest place of the sea.']
Who has the longest holiday?	"The British are very polite and have good manners--they are never tired of saying ""Thank you"",""I am sorry"", or ""Excuse me."" They have good table manners. They enjoy their breakfasts and most of all the traditional tea around 4 or 5 o'clock. The normal working week has five days. Factory workers usually start at 8 am and offices, shops and schools open at 9 am. Workers have 3 weeks' holidays and professional workers(people with higher education ) have usually longer holidays (a month or more). Except these holidays they have public holidays: e.g. New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day. An average Englishman like to live in his own house. Houses are made of red bricks, stone and wood. The house usually has from 4 to 6 rooms, two floors, small front and back gardens. On the ground floor there is a hall, a kitchen, a living room with a fireplace and on the first floor there are parents' and children's bedrooms and a bathroom. The prices of houses depend on the area--the most expensive are the houses in London and South England (about 200,000 pounds); smaller houses in other areas may cost about 50,000 pounds. Social Welfare--The National Health Service gives largely free treatment for everyone living in Britain. People can choose their family doctors. In case of emergency you can call the ambulance by dialing 999 from everywhere. Health centres are run by local authorities. About 7 percent of hospitals, dentists and family doctors work as private. There are about 130 daily and Sunday newspapers and a lot of weekly papers and magazines. The oldest newspaper is The Times. Other famous newspapers are Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Financial Times, etc."	['A doctor.']
What do we learn about study-abroad programs from the passage?	Study-abroad programs are a great way to learn about different cultures. Sometimes students don't have the money to join in these programs. That is why scholarships for study-abroad programs are starting to become popular. Study-abroad programs can often be quite expensive. Finding scholarships is not that difficult. Usually, you can just visit the study-abroad office at your educational institution or even the financial services office. They will have a large directory of available scholarships. If your school does not have these offices, you can just quickly have a look on the Internet and find a wide variety of scholarships you might qualify for. The credentials you need to be considered for a scholarship vary greatly. But, to be a candidate for any scholarship, you generally need to have good grades, be an outstanding person, and be able to take full advantage of the opportunities presented to you. You will be able to show why you are a good candidate through the application process. The application process for each scholarship varies, which usually includes submitting an academic record, an essay, and sometimes an interview. Usually, you will have to submit your academic records. The administrators of the scholarship will know that you take your academic studies seriously. Next you usually need to write an essay. This could be on a wide variety of subjects, but they usually focus on something related to 'why you should get this scholarship' to determine how much you want the scholarship and how good of a candidate you would be. After this, the final few applicants may be asked in for an interview to learn about you and why you would be a good recipient of the scholarship. If you satisfy all these requirements, there is a good chance you will get a scholarship. If you don't have enough money, don't give up but use plenty of scholarship opportunities for you!

How many people can drive equally well while using a cell phone?	"Many people think it is safe to use a cell phone while they are driving. Yet Scores of studies suggest that real multitaskers - those who can carry out multiple tasks equally well, make up just 2 per cent of the population. More surprisingly, the so-called ""supertaskers"" actually have differently structured brains to the other 98 percent. The brain areas that make supertaskers differ from the rest of the population are the same parts that are most different between humans and nonhuman primates , according to David Strayer, director of the applied cognition lab at the University of Utah. Scientists are unsure of the reason why some brains are different. In fact, we could all benefit from doing just one task at once. In most of us, scientists have located a ""bottleneck in the brain"" that may explain why we find it hard to do two things at once. The problem appears to be caused by a logjam of nerve messages. Faced with two almost simultaneous tasks less than 300 milliseconds apart, the brain's ability to deal with the second one slows down. The neural response to the second task was postponed until the response to the first was completed. This means that with e-mails, phone calls, text messages and online social media all competing for our attention, often against a background of television, radio or music, our brains can reach information overload. Scientists made the discovery after scanning the brains of volunteers attempting to multitask on a computer. The task was deliberately designed to involve the use of different senses and _ responses. Dr Rene Marois, one of the neuroscientists who carried out the experiment at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said: ""Our research offers neurological evidence that the brain cannot effectively do two things at once."" The next step, the neuroscientists say, is finding out ""why these areas cannot process two tasks at once."""	['2 in 100.']
What Bartlett-Bragg likes most is that blogs can help students to _ .	"""Blogging is helping students to think and write more critically ,""says an Australian researcher, ""and can help draw out people who would otherwise not engage in debate."" These are the preliminary findings of PHD research by Anne Bartlett-Bragg, a lecturer at the University of Technology, Sydney, who has been using weblogs or blogs in her own teaching since 2001. ""The students are thinking more critically."" she says, ""They are learning to be responsible and they're communicating outside the boundaries of the classroom and the institution, and they like that. ""Bartlett-Bragg says in conventional teaching, students often rely on the lecturer as the main source of ideas and critique for their work. ""I'm a bit over listening to my students giving me back in an essay what I've told them in class."" she says. ""I want them to think for themselves and get different perspectives."" ""What makes blogs useful is their interactive nature."" she says. These web-based forums for discussing ideas, experiences or opinions allow students to discuss publicly what they are studying with other students and experts outside their own university. ""I really encourage them to put their personal opinion in there, provided they are informed and backed up with evidence."" Bartlett-Bragg says because a lot of academics in her field of electronic or e-learning now have their own blogs, students can engage directly with them. She says one of the most powerful facilities in weblogs is pinging, which involves a person positing a comment about someone else's work on their own blog. They use the ""Trackback"" tool to notify the author when they have published the comment, basically inviting them to discuss it. ""They get such a buzz when they make a comment on another person outside the boundaries of the institution and that person responds, or even gives them some further reading."" she says. ""They are getting new perspectives that I can't give them in a normal lecture."""	['think for themselves']

The operation of ridding South Georgia of rats is to carried out in autumn because _ .	"The largest campaign of killing rats in history is set to poison millions of rats on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Scientists say the campaign planned for 2013 and 2014 will restore beautiful South Georgia to the position it once held as the world's most important nesting sites for seabirds. It was sailors in the late 18th century who unintentionally introduced rats to what had been a fresh environment. ""If we can destroy the rats, at least 100 million birds will return to their home on South Georgia,"" says Tony Martin, a biology professor at the University of Dundee who was invited to lead the project. South Georgia is by far the largest island to get rid of animals that destroy native wildlife after being introduced deliberately or accidentally by people. Though rats and mice have done the most damage, cats, foxes, goats, deer, rabbits and other species have been targeted in the campaigns around the world. South Georgia is seven times the size of New Zealand's Campbell Island, currently the largest area ever killing rats. The successful war against Campbell Island rats was carried out in 2001 with 132 tons of poison dropped from five helicopters. ""New Zealand pioneered the techniques for ridding islands of rats and in fact our operation on South Georgia is based on New Zealand's technology."" Says Martin. ""Some New Zealanders will be helping our campaign, including our chief pilot, Peter Garden, who was also chief pilot for the projects at Campbell Island and Rat Island, in the Aleutian chain of the north Pacific."" The second and third stages in 2013 and 2014 will involve dropping as much as 300 tons of poison from the air onto every part of the island where rats might live. It is a huge operation, carried out during the stormy southern autumn when the rats are hungry and the risks of poisoning native wildlife are less than in the spring and summer months. ""Ideally we'd do in winter but the weather makes that too risky,"" Martin says. The ecological payback will be priceless. But Martin says, ""The full benefits will take decades to arrive, because some of these birds are slow to hatch."""	['rats then need more food and the operation does less harm to native wildlife.']
Who was Jim's only friend?	"Seed of Kindness Jim, a successful businessman, told the experience of his childhood. When he was 12, his parents died. He was alone and didn't get on well with others. People always laughed at him. No one showed kindness to him. His only friend was a dog named Tige. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind work sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife. One day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. Suddenly one of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to pick it up, she dropped other bags. He came to help her.""Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!""she said kindly, smiling. A special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog happily and went directly to the river nearby. ""Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!""he repeatedthe woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog,""You are a nice little dog!""Tige raised its ears as if it understood. ""Uhum! Even a dog likes it!""he said,""Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you anymore.""Tige waved its tail happily. The boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life. After telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said,""Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great powerit has!"""	['The dog.']
What should students pay attention to when using the library?	When you use our university libraries there are different learning spaces available so you can decide what is best for your purpose.

Food, drink and phones Cold snacks and drinks can be consumed in most areas of the libraries though we ask that you help keep the learning environment clean and pleasant for everyone by clearing rubbish into the bins provided. Mobile phones can be used in the social learning areas and group study rooms but not in the silent study spaces or the hallways or stairs that lead to those areas. We ask that you switch your phone to silent mode when you come in the library.	['Keeping their mobile phones silent all the time.']
David Bieber was most probably handcuffed in _ .	"One of Britain's bravest women told yesterday how she helped to catch suspected police killer David Bieber --- and was thanked with flowers by the police. It was also said that she could be in line for a share of up to PS30,000 reward money . Vicki Brown , 30 , played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt . Vicki , who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years , told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly. Then she waited alone for three hours while armed police prepared to storm the building. She said : "" I was very nervous . But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park I was so glad they were there."" The alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 8 pm the day before New Year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. She said : "" He didn't seem to want to talk too much and make any eye contact."" Vicki, the only employee on duty , called her boss Margaret , 64 , and husband Stan McKale, 65 , who phoned the police at 11 pm. Officers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston , Gateshead , at about 11:30 pm to make sure that this was the wanted man . Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes. "" It was about ten to two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said ' Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside ?' My heart missed a beat ."" Vicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key. "" I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that part of the hotel , so I went to watch . I could not see into the man's room , but I could see the passage . The police kept shouting at the man to come out with his hands showing . Then suddenly he must have come out because they shouted for him to lie down while he was handcuffed ."""	['the passage']

What is the best title for the story?	"""So?""he said.""Er...so what?""""So what do you really want to do?""he asked.

What did Dr.Jason decide to do to help the students?	"""The price of books for our students is just getting higher and higher and,combined with the rising cost of tuition,it's killing these students,""said Peter Jason,a college professor.""Remember,students are one of the poorest groups of people in America.Almost half of them have at least one part-time job.In fact,one of my students has three jobs.And she still manages to have high scores and go to school full-time."" Textbook prices are traditionally high.Adding to that problem,many college teachers change textbooks year after year;they either upgrade to a new edition or switch to an entirely different textbook.This further hurts students because if an instructor no longer uses a particular textbook,that book has no resale value. Dr.Jason decided to make lire a little easier and a lot cheaper for his students by writing his own book on public speaking.""Many books have an increased price because of CD-ROMs,lots of color photographs and pictures.I talked to my students,and many of them,like me,prefer to keep things simple! So,a few years ago,I wrote my own textbook.Compared to most other public speaking books,mine is half the number of pages,and one-third the price.That is,$30 instead of $90.When I wrote a second edition last year,students only had to buy the 35 new pages, For only $7.00,they had almost a new book.

Why did Mark touch the computer against his father's warning?	"Mark and his brother Jason both were looking at the shining new computer enviously. Jason was determined not to go against their father's wishes but Mark was more adventurous than his brother. He loved experimenting and his aim was to become a scientist like his father. ""Dad will be really mad if he finds out you've been playing with his new computer."" Jason said, ""He told us not to touch it."" ""He won't find out."" Mark said, ""I'll just have a quick look and shut it down."" Mark had been scolded before for touching his father's equipment. But his curiosity was difficult to control and this new computer really puzzled him. It was a strange-looking machine -one his dad had brought home from the laboratory where he worked. ""It's an experimental model,"" his father had explained, ""so don't touch it under any circumstances."" But his warning only served to make Mark more curious. Without any further thought, Mark turned on the power switch. The computer burst into life and seconds later, the screen turned into color1s, shifting and changing and then two big white words appeared in the center of the screen: ""SPACE TRANSPORTER."" ""Yes!"" Mark cried excitedly, ""It's a computer game. I knew it! Dad's only been pretending to work. He's really been playing games instead."" A new message appeared on the screen: ENTER NAMES VOYAGER 1: ... VOYAGER 2: ... Mark's fingers flew across the keyboard as he typed in both of their names. INPUT ACCEPTED. START TRANSPORT PROGRAM. AUTO-RETRIEVE INITIATED The screen turned even brighter and a noise suddenly rose in volume. ""I think we'd better shut it off, Mark,"" Jason yelled, reaching for the power switch. He was really frightened. But his hand never reached the switch. A single beam of dazzling white light burst out of the computer screen, wrapping the boys in its glow , until they themselves seemed to be glowing. Then it died down just as suddenly as it had burst into life. And the boys were no longer there. On the screen, the letters changed. TRANSPORT SUCCESSFUL. DESTINATION: MARS. RETRIEVE DATE: 2025."

The farmers in Finland wear paper boots in winter _ .	When we think of paper, we think of newspapers and books. But there are many other uses. Only half of the world's paper is used for books and newspapers. Paper is very good for keeping you warm. You have perhaps seen homeless men asleep on a large number of newspapers. In Finland, it is sometimes - 40degC in winter. The farmers wear paper boots in the snow. Nothing could be warmer. Each year, more and more things are made of paper. We have had paper cups and plates for a long time. But now we hear that chairs, tables, and even beds can be made of paper. With paper boots and shoes, you can also wear paper hats, paper dresses, and paper raincoats. When you have used them once, you throw them away and buy new ones. The latest use of paper seems to be paper houses. These are not small houses for children to play in, but real, big houses for people to live in. You can buy a house with three rooms for about 500 dollars. You can put it up by yourself in a few hours, and you can use it for about five years.	['to keep their feet warm']
Dressing up chimpanzees in human clothes will make people want to _ .	"The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) is an international organization that brings together zoos and aquariums to cooperate in efforts to advance the respectful, humane treatment of animals in our care, and to support the conservation of animals across the globe. WAZA was shocked and disappointed to learn of the inappropriate and damaging content in the new TV show Wonderful Friends, jointly produced by China's biggest zoo & circus company (Chimelong) and one of China's top TV companies (Hunan TV). The show dresses up chimpanzees in human clothes and markets them as ""cute pets"". The animals are placed in many stressful and harmful situations, in order to create ""entertaining"" story lines. It is disappointing to note that Chinese pop singer and actress Li Yuchun took part in this show, helping to popularize these misleading and inhumane practices. In one example, a young chimp bit an actress in the face right next to a zoo visitor, and then bit another actor leaving a wound on his hand. WAZA is strongly against practices and shows of this nature. Animals presented in such cruel and unnatural surroundings cannot contribute to serious conservation efforts. Presenting chimpanzees in unnatural and anthropomorphic settings suggests to viewers that they are not endangered and make great pets. Such shows are not only disrespectful to animals, they also lack any sort of conservation purpose. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, chimpanzees are now considered endangered, and wild populations are declining rapidly. WAZA recognizes that the growing popularity of television programmes such as Wonderful Friends can only increase the already-huge existing demand for chimpanzees as pets. WAZA requests the following: (1) The immediate cancel of this programme and similar shows wherever they may take place; (2) That all animals held in captivity be provided with the highest level of care; (3) That under no circumstances should chimpanzees be imported from the wild just for entertainment purposes."

The grandson makes a lot of noise as _ .	Bill and his family has been living in the six-family building for years. All the neighbors got along fairly well with each other until recently. An old man and his wife used to live on the second floor. Bill's mother and the old lady were good friends. Unfortunately the lady died last month. Her husband could not live alone, so he had his grandson move over and live with him. The grandson has become a problem to all the neighbors, especially to Bill's family. The walls of the building are thin and he is noisy. Bill is used to peace and quiet but the young man likes to listen to the radio late at night. Sometimes friends of his visit and they make a lot of noise. That is too much for Bill's family. Bill's mother once asked the old man politely if he was able to sleep well at night, but obviously the man didn't understand what she meant. If he did and spoke to his grandson, the young man obviously didn't listen, since things haven't changed any. Everyone in Bill's family agrees that something must be done though they don't want to hurt the kind old man.	['he never thinks other people might not be happy with so much noise around']
The main idea of the passage is that _ .	Fire can help people in many ways. But it can also be very harmful. Fire can make water hot and house warm, give light and cook food. But fire can burn things, too. It can make trees, houses, animals and other things catch fire . If some people can't run away from fire, it can kill them. This happens in every country every year. Sometimes big fire can burn forests. A month ago, a large forest fire broke out in Yunnan Province. It lasted nearly half a month. The forest in Heilongjiang Province and the grassland in Inner Mongolia caught fire in May, 2006. After more than ten days' fight, over 30,000 people and soldiers put out the fire at last. Nobody knows clearly when people began to make fire, but there are many interesting stories about the first time a man or a woman started a fire. One story from Australia tells about a man who went to the sun and brought fire down a long time ago. Today people know how to make a fire with matches . Children sometimes like to play with them. But matches can be very dangerous. The match can burn a piece of paper and then it can burn a house. A small fire can become a big fire, and destroy many things. Fire kills many people every year. So you must be careful with fire. ,.	['fire is dangerous and harmful']

How does the passage mainly develop ?	Denmark is one of the happiest nations on earth with some of the best quality of life. You don't need statistics to understand the Dane's happy lot. Walk around any Danish town and you'll experience some of the most harmonious civic spaces anywhere. Their intimate scales and perfect transport systems combine the rich history and bold modern lines of the built environment to delight the eye, and the locals' manners and sense of humor is refreshing. Denmark's capital Copenhagen is a remarkable city with well-preserved medieval streets, renowned art galleries, Michelin-starred restaurants and a healthy business center. Finding something to do is never a problem and if all else fails, just admiring the streets with a hotdog in hand is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours . Beyond the capital and the bigger cities, Denmark offers a mix of lively towns such as Ribe and Odense plus rural countryside, medieval churches , Renaissance castles and tidy 18th-century villages. The coastline of Denmark with its sand dunes and greenery is a sight that always attracts visitors. So, no matter what time of year you're in Denmark, you shouldn't miss out on a trip to the nearest beach . It's hard , in short , to find fault with the place. The visitor's most heartfelt complaint is usually the cost of visiting Denmark. True, it is not a cheap destination , but no more so than the UK, and which nation's public transport system would you rather use? Cheer yourself up by thinking of the country's remarkable organization and clockwork railway timetable as being financed by the extremely high taxes paid by your hosts. When viewed in this way , this first-rate destination seems like good value, and you get the fairy tales thrown in for free: the Danish royal family is genuinely loved and respected by the vast majority of its citizens, not least handsome Prince Frederik , his beautiful Australian-born princess-bride, Mar, and their young family.

For the modern traveler it's very easy to reach the famous city on the river Seine. You can fly there in less time than it takes to travel by train from Beijing toShanghai. Once you reachParisyou are surprised by a city that is the perfect combination of modern life and history. The best time to arrive is the spring. Winter is cold and wet, the summer humid and autumn windy. In the spring the flowers are blossoming, the sun shines and the birds sing. The people ofParisare most pleased with spring in their city. They play in the parks, visit the beautiful monuments and enjoy ""joie de vivre"" . If you arrive in Parisin the springtime, you will enjoy the life of lazy walks down the boulevards too, sitting in the cafes and visiting the most famous museums in the world. There are many places for you to visit, Notre Dame de Paris, the nearby palace of Versaille, the arch of Triumph and of course the Eiffel Tower. You'll notice that in Paris the people in the cafes all look out at the people on the street. They like to see and be seen. Some monuments are not French, but fromEgypt, orGreece, or maybe Chinese! There are many, many dogs, especially the famous French poodie with his well-tailored looks. This is the city where the French impressionists painted their works, where arts, culture and literature are the main passions of life. Apart of course, from the food! All Frenchmen like to eat and drink wine - they are never happier than when they are having a picnic on the banks of the river Seine in the springtime."

According to this passage, we mainly find poor scores may result from _	"Ann Whimey, a sophomore at Colorado State University, first had a problem taking tests when she began college. ""I was always well prepared for my tests. Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer."" The young student was experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the great nervousness. though poor scores are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety causes low scores. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students. Special university counseling courses try to help students. In these courses, counselors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the test shows their anxiety is high, the students can take courses to help them deal with their nervousness. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease, learn information, then come out without difficulty in a test. An expert at the University of California explains, ""With almost all students, relaxation is felt after taking our program. Most of them have better control during their test. Almost all have some improvements. For some, the improvement is very great."	['nervousness']
What do we know about Mrs.Ohama from the text?	"Mrs.Ohama spoke to the graduates of Martin Luther King Jr.High School on Saturday in her only high school commencement speech this year. The ceremony took place in the gymnasium of Tennessee State University The first lady told the 170 graduates that she spent too much of her time in college focusing on academe achievements.While her success in college and law school led to 8 good job, she said, she ended up focusing on public service. ""My message to you today is that don't waste a minute living someone else's dream: she said. It takes lot of real work to discover what brings you joy and you won't find what you love simply by checking mailboxes or surfing the net. She said MLK reminded her of her own high school experience in Chicago.""My No.1 goal was to go to a high school that would push me and challenge me,"" she said.""I wanted to go somewhere that would celebrate achievement.Unfortunately, schools like this don't exist for every kid."" she said.""You are blessed"" The first lady told graduates that failure may be 8 part of their college lives and careers, and that how they respond determines what they will become. ""That's when you find out what you're really made of in those hard times,"" she said.""But you can only do that if you're willing to put yourself in position where you might fail."" Overcoming difficulties has been the mark of many great people, she said, ""Oprah was demoted from her first job as news reporter, and now she doesn't even need a last name,"" she said of media giant Oprah Winfrey ""And then there's this guy Barack Obama, I could take up a whole afternoon talking about his failures He lost his first race for Congress"",the first lady Joked, ""and now he gets to call himself my husband"""	['She is enthusiastic about public service']
What is the passage mainly about?	"A chip inserted in a young quadriplegic's brain is already improving his quality of life. Soon the benefits may be more widespread. A 25-year-old man unable to move from the neck down recently did what many assumed impossible. After a knife attack that had left him paralyzed, all he could move was his head, which he used to push a switch and call for a nurse. And he could turn his wheelchair by blowing into a straw near his face. That was it. Then last June, a Foxborough (Mass.) company called Cyber Kinetics opened the man's skull and inserted a special chip no larger than a baby aspirin. That insert has given him a few additional and precious abilities. When connected to a special computer via a cable, the chip translates the young man's thoughts into commands that let him move a cursor across a PC screen and open e-mail. He can draw a circle with a computer painting program. And he can use a robotic hook to perform simple tasks like picking up a candy and sliding it across a table. All he has to do is to think. Several new studies have begun or been completed in the past year. In fact, more than half of the scientific papers in this field, called brain-to-computer interaction (BCI), have been published in the past two years, notes Jonathan Wolpaw, a research physician at Wadsworth Center, the New York State Health Dept.'s research laboratory. Brain surgeries are no longer rare: Thousands of Parkinson's disease patients have had special devices inserted in their brains to ease uncontrollable shaking and other symptoms. The inserts themselves have improved, so the body doesn't reject them as furiously . And significant development has been achieved in software used to interpret the brain's signals and change them into commands understood by computers. But increased demand for thought technology remains the biggest reason for the field's progress. Today, 4 million Americans live with paralysis according to the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. Scientists hope that thought technology will reduce the impact of such disabilities. People with spinal-cord injuries, for example, often lose their ability to walk because the communications network between their brain and their legs has been interrupted. The brain still commands the leg muscles to move, but they don't hear its orders. Thought technology, scientists hope, will bridge this communications gap. ""Our goal is for you to see paralyzed people eating at a restaurant and for you not to know that they are paralyzed,"" says John Donoghue, founder and chief scientific officer at Cyber Kinetics."

At last, each of the team members kept looking back _ .	"I was going to die in Antarctica, I was certain.An image of my frost-covered body, pale and lifeless, filled my mind as I glanced around.In all directions the empty wilderness of Antarctica stretched away from me, the only feature on the landscape was the division between snow and sky.I gazed sadly at my team.They were rapidly disappearing over the horizon. I was leading an expedition attempting to reach the south pole.The team was made up of ordinary women from all around the world, from Jamaica, India, Singapore and Cyprus, many of whom had never seen snow, or spent a night in a tent before we set off.Our aim was to be the most international all-female team to reach the South Pole. As I watched, the rest of the team marched on, unaware that I was not with them.By the time I realized that my sledge was firmly trapped, the team were already a long way ahead of me.I called out to Era, my teammate, "" Era! Stop !"" Getting no response I called again, but my shouts were carried away in the opposite direction by the wind.Seconds passed.Nothing.I was gradually being left alone, completely defenseless against the low temperatures of Antarctica. My strength increased when I thought of a cold lonely death.I pulled again my sledge, which moved a little. I removed the ice with my ski-pole and boot, desperately trying to break the sledge free.The sledge shot forward, knocking me off balance.I struggled to my feet and set off after the team. I caught up just as Reena, my teammate from India, looked behind her and noticed there was one person missing.She swung around on her skis in shock and spotted me in the near distance. As we continued, my panic slowly faded.For the rest of the day, each of the team was glancing over their shoulder every few minutes.They were not going to risk losing me again."

During the 18th and 19th century, _ .	The future of pinnipeds looks much brighter today than it once did. At one time, about 100 years ago, it seemed certain that many pinnipeds in the world would be destroyed by human hunters. Today, it appears that most species( ) of pinnipeds are out of danger. Hunting was not controlled during the 18th and 19th centuries, because little was known about the lives of pinnipeds. Whales and pinnipeds were hunted for the oil from their body fat. This oil was used in lamps before electric lights were invented. Millions of seals and other pinnipeds were used to provide oil for the lamps of the world. As a result, the numbers of many pinniped species fell rapidly. Several things happened that helped to save pinnipeds. First, species that were hunted to near extinction were left alone because their numbers were too low and the cost of hunting them went up greatly. At the same time, electric lights were invented and the market for seal oil became smaller. Finally, governments around the world made laws to protect pinnipeds. As a result of all these things, the numbers of most pinniped species have grown in recent years. With some species, such as Northern fur seals, there may be as many animals alive today as there were before all the hunting began. However, oil is still a danger to pinnipeds and all sea animals. But this time it's not because they are hunted for their oil. The oil that puts them in danger is from oil spills in the sea. The oil covers their fur and reduces their body temperatures. Oil also sticks to the foods they eat. This modern danger to pinnipeds and their environment is one we must work to prevent.	['many families were using lamps']
The text mainly describes Rania as _ .	"A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon , a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children--Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world. Rania was bom in Kuwait, in 1970.Shortly after Iraq invaded that country in 1990, her family fled and settled in Jordan.After graduating from a business school, Rania became successful in the business world. When she was just 22, she went to a dinner party that changed her life forever.It was there that she met Jordan' s Prince Abdullah.Six months later, Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family. After the death of her father - in - law, King Hussein, in 1999, Prince Abdullah was crowned King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Rania became the world' s youngest living queen. In her role as Queen, Rania has become well known around the world for her charity work and her efforts to improve educational opportunities for girls.She is an outspoken advocate of women' s rights, education reform, and child abuse.She is also well - known for her efforts to remove Western stereotypes about the Muslim world. Rania explains that there is a direct relationship between increasing education and eliminating poverty."" You can change the course of a nation through education,"" she says."" One of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education.Once she has the education she can then have control over her income, she can change her life, she can have choices."" In the future, Rania says, she hopes for a more open and secure world.""We look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think,' Well, that' s their problem.' But it' s not,"" she says."" When you solve somebody else' s problem, you are solving a problem for yourself, because our world today is so interconnected."""	['a social activist']
What is Not the problem happening since the scheme was carried out?	"London has become a cycle-friendly zone after the launch of a new bike hire scheme. It has been designed to encourage more people to cycle in and around central London. So how does it work?First you have to sign up to the scheme to be sent a key. The key will unlock one of the bikes, which are kept at docking stations in and around central London. You have to pay an access fee for the key and then you pay as you go, for the length of time you use the bike. Transport for London, which runs the scheme, are hoping to have 6,000 bikes and 400 docking stations in place by the end of the year. The new hire system is hoping to ease traffic jams in London and is expected to create up to 40,000 extra cycle trips a day into the city centre. London Mayor Boris Johnston launched the scheme and said London has been ""filled with thousands of gleaming machines that will transform the look and feel of our street and become as commonplace on our roads as black cabs and red buses"". However, there have been a few problems since the scheme was launched last Friday. On the first day some people found they couldn't dock their bike properly and their usage of the bike had not registered. Transport for London did admit they had been expecting a few ""teething problems"" and have said they would not charge for the first day as a ""gesture of goodwill"". Some other people have criticized the lack of docking stations and locks for the bikes as well as the price it costs to hire the bicycles. Despite the comments, the green-thinking London Mayor still says with certainty, ""My crusade for the capital to become the greatest big cycling city in the world has taken a great pedal-powered push forwards."""	"[""People couldn't find the registered bicycles.""]"
Joe Wong is used as an example to _ .	"A good joke can be the hardest thing to understand when studying a foreign language. As a recent article in The Guardian newspaper noted, ""There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than understanding vocabulary and grammar."" Being able to understand local jokes is often seen as an incredible ice-breaker for a language learner eager to form friendships with native speakers. ""I always felt that humor was a ceiling that I could never break through,"" Hannah Ashley, a public relations account manager in London, who once studied Spanish in Madrid. Told The Guardian, ""I could never speak to people on the same level as I would speak to a native English speaker. I almost came across as quite a boring person because all I could talk about was facts."" In fact, most of the time, jokes are only funny for people who share a cultural background or understand humor in the same way. Chinese-American comedian Joe Wong found this out first-hand. He had achieved huge success in the US, but when he returned to China in 2008 for his first live show in Beijing, he discovered that people didn't think his. Chinese jokes were as funny as his English ones. In Australia, meanwhile many foreigners find understanding jokes about sports to be the biggest headache. ""The hardest jokes are related to rugby because I know nothing about rugby,"" said Melody Cao, who was once a student in Australia. ""When I heard jokes I didn't get, I just laughed along."" In the other two major English-speaking countries, the sense of humor is also different. British comedian Simon Pegg believes that while Britons use irony-basically, saying something they don't mean to make a joke-every day, people in the US don't see the point of using it so often. ""British jokes tend to be more subtle and dark, while American jokes are more obvious with their meanings, a bit like Americans themselves,"" he wrote in The Guardian."

What is the main idea of the passage?	"For some people, music is no fun at all. About 4% of the population is what scientists call ""amusic"". People who are amusic are born without the ability to enjoy musical notes. Amusic people often cannot tell the differences between two songs. As a result, songs sound like noise to an amusic. Many amuics compare the sound of music to pieces of metal hitting each other. Life can be hard for amusics. In fact, most people cannot begin to understand what it feels like to be an amusic. Just going to a restaurant or a shopping center can be uncomfortable or even painful. That is why many amusics have to stay away from places where there is music. However, this can result in social loneliness. ""I used to hate parties,"" says Margaret, a seventy-year-old woman who only recently discovered that she was amusic. By studying people like Margaret, scientists are finally learning how to identify this unusual condition. Scientists say that the brains of amusics are different from those of people who can enjoy music. The difference is complex , and it is not connected with poor hearing. Amusics can understand other non-musical sounds well. They also have no problems understanding common speech. Scientists compare amusics to people who just can't see certain colors. Many amusics are happy when their condition is finally diagnosed . For years, Margaret felt embarrassed about her problem music. Now she knows that she is not alone. That makes it easier for her to explain. When people invite me to a concert, I just say ""No, thanks. I'm amusic."" says Margret."	"[""Some people's inability to enjoy music.""]"

Why does the writer want a personal motto?	"For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted a personal motto. I wanted a saying that I could really try to live my life by. I mean all the humorous book and storybook heroes always have a personal principle they follow. Good manners! Courage! Keenness! But a part of me could never get myself to create my own motto because I never knew where to start and I never thought I could give one. ""With great power comes great responsibility."" is a quote by the great writer and philosopher, Voltaire. More familiar, it makes an appearance in the modern day movie performance of the superhero Spider-Man. This saying provides a sense of responsibility for those with actually limitless power. ""Be good to others and others will be good to you."" is another well-known proverb that has roots in almost all of the major religions. Although it is less practiced today than it is lectured, it is a powerful and good motto to live by. Kindness, in this sense, is the final power in judging every action. My personal motto today has an idea - being efficient. Through my limited knowledge, I have come to find that this is simply the best way for me to give insight about who I am and what I believe in. Efficiency is a quality that everyone desires for, right? Who doesn't want to be able to not only work fast but to achieve great results? To some, it may appear to be a frightening journey. But to me, it means that I have a lifelong journey to improve the methods and ideas with which I come near my tasks. Regardless of what motto you want to live by, I believe that everyone should have one, or two or more. These are all symbols of a perfect story of us, in our own view. And it immediately provides insight to the type of person we were, we are and what we strive to be. We are never meant to be perfect, but it is important to try and live by a belief that will help us reach our potential. All you have to do is know what your excitement is and live by it."

Why are some people so good at getting lost?	Some people are like homing pigeons; Drop them off anywhere.and they'll find their way around.Other people.through, can't tell holding a map upside down.Are the directionally challenged just bad learners? Not all of your navigational skills are learned.Research shows that your sense of direction is innate.An innate ability is something you are born with.Your brain has special navigational neurons--head-direction cells, place cells, and grid cells --and they help program your inside compass when you're just a baby. In 2010.scientists carried out an experiment to study baby rates' activity in their brains.Although the rats were newborns.the researchers discovered that their head-direction cells(which help them recognize the direction they're facing) were fully grown and developed.The rats.it seemed.were born with a sense of direction.And they hadn't even opened their eyes yet! Humans.of course, are not rats.But the hippocampus --the brain we use for navigation--is similar in most mammals.If the rat's compass develops this way.then it's likely a human's compass does, too. If we're born with a sense of direction.then why are some people so good at getting lost? The scientists found that the two other cells---place and grid cells--developed within the first month.Place cells are thought to help us form a map in our mind.while gird cells help us navigate new and unfamiliar places.The two cells work together, and that's where the trouble might be. People who took part in a 2013 study played a video game that required them to travel quickly between different places.Monitoring their brains.the scientists.According to researcher Michael Kahana, differences in how gird cells work may help explain why some people have a better sense of direction than others.

Where can you most probably find the passage?	Anyone who has worn a cast knows that rebuilding muscle strength once the cast is removed can be difficult. Now researchers at the Ohio Musculoskeletal and Neurological Institute (OMNI) at Ohio University have found that the mind is _ in maintaining muscle strength following a long period of not moving and that mental imagination may be key in reducing the associated muscle loss. Strength is controlled by a number of factors----the most studied by far is skeletal muscle. However, the nervous system is also an important, though not fully understood, determining factor of strength and weakness. Brian C. Clark and colleagues set out to test how the system functions in strength development. They designed an experiment to measure changes in wrist muscle strength in three groups of healthy adults. Twenty-nine subjects wore a hard cast that extended from just below the elbow past the fingers, effectively preventing the hand and wrist from moving, for four weeks. Fifteen subjects who did not wear casts served as the control group. Of the 29 people wearing a hard cast, half were asked to regularly perform an exercise, imagining they were strongly contracting their wrist for five seconds and then resting for five seconds. This was repeated four times in a row followed by a one-minute break for a total of 13 rounds per session and five sessions per week. The other half performed no imagination exercises. At the end of the four-week experiment, both groups who wore casts had lost strength in their unmoving limbs when compared to the control group. But the group that performed imagination exercises lost 50% less strength than the non-imagination group. The nervous system's ability to fully make the muscle recover also returned more quickly in the imagination group compared to the non-imagination group.	['In a science magazine.']
Snow is _ .	"Many people in the world have not seen snow. Some countries never have snow; some have only a little on top of the high mountains. In the north of England, there is quite a lot of snow every winter, but in the south of England, there is usually little. When a student from a warm country comes to England in autumn for the first time, he feels cold at first. There are often clouds, grey sky and cold rain in England in autumn, and most students from warm countries do not like this. But snow is different. It is beautiful. Perhaps, after several mornings, the student wakes up one day, and there is a lot of light in his room. He thinks, ""Is it so late?"" and jumps out of bed. But no, it is not very late. He looks out of the window and there is snow on the ground and on the houses and everywhere."	['beautiful']
We are told that _ .	"Soaring divorce rates around the globe are the environment, American researchers suggested in a study released on a Monday. Michigan State University researcher Jianguo ""Jack"" Liu and his assistant Eunice Yu said the increasing number of divorces leads to more households with fewer people and greater consumption of water and energy. They said housing units require space, construction materials and fuel to heat and cool, regardless of the number of inhabitants. For example, in the United States in 2005, divorced households consumed an extra 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 627 billion gallons of water. An additional 38 million extra rooms required heating and lighting that same year due to divorced households. That costs $6.9 billion in extra utility costs per year, Liu said, plus an added $ 3.6 billion for water, in addition to other costs such as land use. ""A married household actually uses resources more efficiently than a divorced household,"" Liu said. He said that in cohabitating household, people will watch the same television, share the air conditioning and heat and use the same refrigerator. All things use energy at a regularly stable rate, regardless of the number of users. Liu said he was not condemning divorce, ""Some people really need to get divorced."" He said cohabitation--whether by a family or friends--was simply a more environmentally friendly option. Additonally, the researchers noted that trends other than divorce are also changing family living structures, such as the end of multiple generations of a family sharing a home and people remaining single longer. ""People's first reaction to this research is surprise, and then it seems simple."" Liu said in a press release. ""But a lot of things become simple after research is done. Our challenges were to connect the dots and quantify their relationships. People have been talking about how to protect the environment and fight against climate change, but divorce is a factor that people don't notice and it needs to be considered"". He said the increasing energy demands caused by divorce should be considered by governments when they are creating environmental policies. The research was published in this week's online edition of the"	['divorce is rarely considered when people think about protecting the environment.']

Which country is NOT mentioned in the passage as celebrating 'Fool's Day'?	Every year, we celebrate many special days-Mother's Day, Father's Day, and New Year's Day. In some countries, there is a special day for playing tricks on others. In North America and parts of Europe, this day is known as April Fool's Day, and is celebrated on April 1. Many people believe that the French started April Fool's Day. Centuries ago, New Year's Day in Europe was April 1. In 1582, the calendar changed and King Charles IX of France moved it to January 1. Some people did not like this, and chose to keep April 1 as New Year's Day. Many called these people 'April fools' and played jokes and tricks on them. Over time, April 1 became a day to have fun in France. It then spread to England and Scotland, and later, to North America. On April Fool's Day, jokes are common. In the United States, for example, a person may move a friend's clock ahead one hour, or change the sugar and salt. In Scotland, April Fool's Day lasts for two days. The second day is called 'Taily Day'-for one's 'tail'. On this day, people might secretly put a sign saying 'kick me' on a person's back or behind. Other countries have their own 'Fool's Day'. In Spain and Mexico, people play tricks on each other on December 28. In India, it happens on March 31. In many countries around the world, April 1 is a day of fun. Jokes bring about a lot of laughter, and many shouts of 'April Fool'!	['Japan.']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"The world's oldest person, Ms. Baines, died.

It can be guessed from the text that an open house is _	"It's not polite to arrive at a dinner party more than 15 to 20 minutes late.

Though it's often important to arrive at a party on time, yet on the other hand, for open houses, he host or hostess invites guests to arrive and leave between certain times, so you can arrive at any time within the times he or she gives you. It's nice to bring an empty stomach, but it's even nicer to bring a small present. The present should not cost a lot, or you might embarrass the host or hostess. Flowers, wine, or a box of candy will do fine. Never bring more as a present. In an introduction, the order of a name is (1)the given name, (2)the family name. In other words, the given name comes first. It's important not only to learn and remember names, but to repeat them often in conversation. After the introduction, we usually call friends by their given names. Older people may want you to call them by their titles and family names, such as ""Mr.Jones"", ""Mr.Smith"",""Ms.Johson"",or ""Dr.Brown"". A maiden name is a woman's family name at birth. In the United States and Canada, after a woman marries, she takes the family name of her husband in place of her maiden name. It is now becoming common, however, for women to keep their maiden names after they get married."	['a party at which guests can come and go between certain times']
Liu Yang's mission aimed at _ .	Since 1936, many female space explorers have followed Russian astronaut Valentina Tereshkova. Let's look at the missions of four important female astronauts to find out what astronauts do in space. In 1983, Sally Ride became the first American women in space. Her team carried out scientific experiments in space and put two communications satellites in space. Satellites make it possible for us to communicate instantly with each other across the world through TV, radio, and telephones. In 1984, Kathryn Sullivan became the first American women to walk in space. During her mission, she discovered important information about the sun's energy and how it affects the climate in very hot and very cold places on Earth. She also took photographs of Earth and measured air pollution. In 1992, Mae Jemison became the first African-American in space. During her mission, she did scientific experiments using the weightless atmosphere. In space, there is no gravity, so everything floats! Dr. Jemison's experiments gave important information about the human body to produce better medicines and healthcare. In 2012, Liu Yang became the first Chinese women in space. She did experiments in space medicine, which look at how astronauts can survive and stay healthy in space. The conditions in space are very hard on the body and space medicine helps astronauts work safely.	"[""protecting astronauts' health in space""]"
Where can we probably find this passage?	"In a few years,you might be able to speak Chinese,Korean,Japanese,French,and English-and all at the same time. This sounds incredible,but Alex Waibel,a computer science professor at US's Car-negie Mellon University (CMU) and Germany's University of Karlsruhe,announced last week that it may soon be reality. He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other. One application,called Lecture Translation,can easily translate a speech from one language into an-other. Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary. Us-ers also have to be trained how to use the programme. Another machine can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what languagethey speak. ""It is like having a s _ translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you,""Waibel said Prefer to read? So- called Translation Glasses transcribe the translations on a tiny liquid-crystal display(LCD) screen. Then there's the Muscle Translator. Electrodes capture the electrical signals from facial muscle movements made naturally when a person is mouthing words. The signals are then translated into speech.The electrodes could be replaced with wireless chips implanted in a person's face,according to research-ers. During a demonstration held last Thursday in CMU's Pittsburgh campus,a Chinese student named Sang Jun had 11 tiny electrodes attached to the muscles of his cheeks,neck and throat. Then he mouthed-without speaking aloud- a few words in Mandarin to the audience. A few seconds later,the phrase was displayed on a computer screen and spoken out by the computer in English and Spanish: ""Let me introduce our new prototype."" This particular instrument,when fully developed,might allow anyone to speak in any number of lan-guages or,as Waibel put it,""to switch your mouth to a foreign language"". ""The idea behind the universi-ty's prototypes is to create'good enough' bridges for cross- cultural exchanges that are becoming more common in the world,""Waibel said. With spontaneous translators,foreign drivers in Germany could listen to traffic warnings on the radio; tourists in China could read all the signs and talk with local people;leaders of different coun-tries could have secret talks without any interpreters there."

The wife didn't do the housework _ .	"A man came home from work and found his three children outside, still in their pajamas playing in the mud,with empty food boxes and wrappers thrown all around the front yard. The door of his wife's car was open,as was the front door to the house and there was no sign of the dog. Walking into the entry,he found an even bigger mess. A lamp had been knocked over. In the front room the TV was loudly blaring a cartoon channel,and the family room was thrown with toys and various items of clothing. In the kitchen,dishes filled the sink,breakfast food was spilled on the counter,the fridge door was open wide, dog food was spilled on the floor,a broken glass lay under the table,and a small pile of sand was spread by the back door. He quickly headed up the stairs,stepping over toys and more piles of clothes,looking for his wife. He was worried she might be ill,or that something serious had happened. He was met with a small drop of water as it made its way out the bathroom door. As he looked inside he found wet towels, soap and more toys thrown over the floor. Miles of toilet paper lay in a heap and toothpaste had been put over the mirror and walls. As he rushed to the bedroom, he found his wife still sleeping in the bed in her pajamas,reading a novel. She looked up at him,smiled,and asked how his day went. He looked at her puzzled and asked, ""What happened here today?"" She again smiled and answered,""You know every day when you come home from work and ask me what in the world I did today?"" ""Yes,"" was his reply. She answered,""Well,today I didn't do it."""

Which of the following is TURE according to the passage?	"Ask any student which subject he or she hates most. 9 out of 10 students will answer ""math"". No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school? Jenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, ""What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time."" However, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation as it is about learning to think logically and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems. For example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests. How should you divide your resources so that you can get the job done most efficiently ? In situations like this, the ability to think logically will get you to a reasonable answer and solve your problem."	['90%of the students hate learning math.']
According to the passage, the computer technology _ .	Farmer Ed Rawlings smiles as he looks at his orange trees. The young oranges are growing well in Florida's weather. Warm sunshine and gentle rains, along with Ed Rawlings' expert care, will produce a good crop of oranges this year. However, Ed has to guard against Florida's changeable winter weather. In January and February, temperatures can destroy Ed's entire orange crop. Having farmed in Florida for the past 35 years, Ed is prepared for the frost . When temperatures drop below freezing, Ed tries to save his crop by watering his orange trees. The water freezes and forms a thin layer of ice around the trees. Strange as it may sound, this thin layer of ice actually keeps the fruit warm. What happens is simple. When the trees are watered, the water loses heat and becomes ice. The warmth of the heat it loses is taken in by the fruit and keeps its temperature at a safe level. Ed has effectively used this method to save many orange crops. But Ed still faces difficulties. The trees must be watered at the exact moment the temperature drops to the freezing point. Also, just the right quantity of water must be used. Too much water can form a thicker layer of ice that will break the tree's branches . Another difficulty is that wind blows away the heat, so Ed has to worry about not only when but also how often his trees should be watered, and how much water should be used. Computer technology may help Ed with some of these worries. With equipment , air and soil temperatures and wind speed can be measured. The information is fed into a computer which can calculate when the temperature will drop below freezing. The computer can correctly decide the quantity of water to be used and how frequently( ) the trees should be watered. Ed finds looking after his orange trees a lot easier with the help of a computer, and, his customers will have the benefits of computer--age oranges.	['helps the farmer get a better harvest']
From the passage, we can infer that _ .	"Dolphins and sharks are showing up in surprisingly shallow water just off the Florida coast. Mullets, crabs, rays and small fish gather by the thousands off an Alabama pirer. Birds covered in oil are crawling deep into marshes , never to be seen again. Marine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing some strange phenomena. Fish and other wildlife seem to be fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast in a trend that some researchers see as a potentially troubling sign. The animals' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted, and the crowding could result in mass die-offs as fish run out of oxygen. Also, the animals could easily be captured by their enemies. The nearly two-month-old spill has created an environmental disaster in US history as tens of millions of gallons have flown into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Scientists are seeing some unusual things as they try to understand the effects on thousands of species of marine life. For nearly four hours Monday, a three-person crew with Greenpeace cruised past delicate islands and mangrove-dotted inlets in Barataria Bay off southern Louisiana. They saw dolphins by the dozen frolicking in the oily sheen and oil-tinged pelicans feeding their young. But they spotted no dead animals. ""I think part of the reason why we're not seeing more yet is that the impacts of this crisis are really just beginning,"" Greenpeace marine biologist John Hocevar said. The counting of dead wildlife in the Gulf is more than an academic exercise; the deaths will help determine how much BP pays in damages."

It can be inferred that _ .	"When you're surfing the Internet on your laptop from your dorm or home, do you know your personal details are being gathered secretly? And would you be surprised to know the information may be sold cheaply to advertisers and marketers? According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, all it takes is a tiny file in a computer-a single code consisting of a long series of numbers and letters to record the computer user's age, gender, location, favorite movies and hobbies. The newspaper reports that Lotame Solutions Inc., a New York company, uses sophisticated software called a "" beacon"" to capture what people are typing on a website. Lotame packages that data into profiles about individuals, only without their names, and sells the profiles to companies seeking customers. Batches of such data may be sold for a few dollars. The Wall Street Journal survey discovered that spying on Internet users is one of the fastest-growing businesses on the World Wide Web. The ""cookie"" a tiny text file put on your PC by websites or marketing firms which might be used to remember your. preferences for one site, or to track you across many sites is already old news.

The writer of this passage wants to tell us _ .	"Have you ever heard the old saying ,""Never judge a book by its cover"" ?This is a good rule to follow when trying to judge the intelligence of others. Some people have minds that shine only in certain situations. A young people with an unusual gift in writing may find himself speechless in the presence of a pretty girl when he speaks. He may not be able to find the right words. But don't make mistake of thinking him stupid, with a pen and a paper, he can express himself better than anybody . Other people may fool you into overestimating their intelligence by putting up a good front. A student who listens attentively and takes notes in class is sure to make a favorable impression on his teachers. But when it comes to exams, he may score near the bottom of the class . It all boils down to this: you can't judge someone by appearance. The only way to determine a person's intelligence is to get to know him. Then you can see how he reacts to different situations. The more situation you see, the better your judgment is likely to be. So take your time. Don't judge a book by its cover ."	"[""not to judge person's intelligence by his appearance""]"
According to Ramon Llamas, Apple always _ .	"There is no doubt that Apple is well aware of the increased competition in the market and could be in a hurry to put another device out there, said Ramon Llamas, senior research analyst at IDC Mobile Devices Technology and Trends. Given its history with product launches and business policy, though, Apple probably isn't going to rush an iPhone release simply to put it on shelves, he said. ""If you're Tim Cook (CEO of Apple), you're thinking if you want to pay more attention to how to keep growing that bottom line and keep investors happy, or continue with the same approach from Apple, which is do what we can do and manage products and releases in the best way they can work for us. Apple usually does things in their own time ,and I'm having a hard time buying this May or June timeline."" Llamas told Mac News World. While it,s probable that Apple is definitely in a testing stage for its next smartphone , consumers likely have a standard wait for the finished product, said Colin Gibbs, analyst at GigaOm Pro. ""It typically takes a year or longer to create a state-of-the-art smartphone, so no one should be surprised Apple is in the testing stages with the next iPhone. And while it's possible that Apple could launch the next iPhone this spring or summer, I'm not expecting to see it until a little later in the year,"" he told Mac News World. When it does launch, though, it could be in a variety of colors, said Gibbs. ""Apple has already tested the waters with releasing colored devices when it revamped(,)its iPod line last fall, so it's not too much of a stretch to believe it would want the new twist with its smartphone, as well"". ""I wouldn't be surprised if the new iPhone becomes available in some new colors,'' he said. ""That could be done pretty cheaply ,and it would give Apple a new marketing angle."""

According to the text, living by your own values, you will _ .	You feel happiest when you create a healthy balance between giving and receiving. If you give and give without making time to fill your own needs, then it's likely you will burn out, or feel upset .When you take and take without giving anything back ,you never feel fulfilled, so you are always searching for ways to fill the _ in your life. The way to create a healthy balance between giving and receiving is to know and then live by your values .I break values up into two groups which I call being and having values. Your being values are the character traits of the ideal person you would like to be. I suggest to my clients that they choose three being values that they are willing to make a commitment to live by. An example of some being values are: kind, loving, generous, inspirational, peaceful, wise and even powerful. By acting on these values you give to others through your actions and you inspire others by being a positive role model. Mastering being these character traits becomes your life purpose. Your having values are the feelings you need to create in order to be happy. These could be companionship, achievement, support, being valued or financial security. This is what you receive. You take responsibility for filling your own needs by taking steps to create these feelings and conditions in your life. When you make a commitment to live by your being values, it becomes easier to make conscious choices rather than reactionary ones. If your usual pattern is to talk about your problems, you could choose to think and act like a calm person. A calm person might go for a walk, meditate, or set a time limit before responding. If your usual pattern is to worry, you could choose to act like a responsible or wise person. In other words, you would act like the person you choose to be--this is the key to personal power. When you choose to act on your values, you not only feel good about yourself, you reinforce your chosen beliefs. Over time acting in this way changes how you see the world, and in turn the way other people think of you.	['form positive personality']

According to Timothy Bates, less women are in the smartest group because _ .	"Men have always believed that they are smarter than women. Now, a study has found that while this is certainly true, men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex. In the study, scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an uneven number of men not only in the top two percent, but also in the bottom two percent. The study's participants were tested on science, maths, English and mechanical abilities. Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group, there were also twice as many men among the bottom. The aggregate scores of men and women were similar. One of the study's authors, psychology professor Timothy Bates, said that the phenomenon may be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been restricted to spend more time taking care of their homes. ""The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival and the safety of the middle ground.,"" the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates, of Edinburgh University, as saying. The research _ past results that men were more likely than women to receive first class University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds. It has been said that men are more ready to take risk when it comes to academics. Women have always found to be steadier in their learning. A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds, while men are continuing to receive more thirds. The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors women's steady approach."	['they have to spend more time to tale care of their homes than men']
What do you think of the GM plant?	Today there are 7 billion people on the earth.By the year 2050 there may be 9.0 billion.We will have a lot more people to feed.We need more food. One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.For thousands of years,farmers have made plants better.Every season,they pick the best plants for the next season.It works very slowly.Since1983 scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods ,or GM foods. By changing the genetic material of a plant,it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases:a kind of rice is being prepared,for example,which stops people from becoming blind.Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and they bring in more money.Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural.No one knows how good or bad they are.Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.But there are strong feelings against them,because they are unnatural. They may feed people,then hurt them or their children later.But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use,and they are not going to die.In 2050 we may think differently about them.

What did the writer think of the army before Ron joined?	"My brother Ron joined the US army a few years ago. Most girls, especially those who are my age, are thrilled by anything that has to do with the ""army"". It's a novelty to them to shoot a gun, jump out of a plane, and wear uniform. Now I know you're thinking that I must find it really cool to know a solider, who's my brother. That's wrong, before I found out that my brother joined the army, I was crazy about the army. Firstly, I wanted to go to college, knew that joining the army was probably the only way I could get it as my parents couldn't afford it. Additionally there were all the other points of the army that grabbed my heart. I wanted the challenge, I wanted the discipline and I wanted the feeling that I would be doing something beyond the ability of average citizen. But as soon as my brother joined the army, all those things fell away. All I saw were dead people, guns shooting, tanks turning into a ball of fire, tents burning, and lots of blood. It was so horrible. When Ron went to Iraq, I freaked out whenever I didn't hear from him for more than a week. I kept up with the news, reading the latest newspaper and listening to the hourly reports. And every time I heard that an American solider was killed, I prayed, it' wasn't Ron. I'm proud of my brother for serving our country, and his willingness to devote his life to something he finds important. It's great to see how discipline and mature he's got, and I'm glad he has his college paid for. But although I am proud, I gladly give up the ""coolness"" of having a brother in the army. I would be perfectly all right if I had never seen that uniform on him, and he was just a plain old ""boring"" brother. I love my brother, and I'm proud of him, but I want him back home!"

Why is Venice still getting lower and lower?	A city without cars would be very strange, right? But Venice is such a city. Venice is in the northeast of Italy. It wasn't built on land, like Beijing or Shanghai, but on more than 110 islands. Seawater is everywhere around the city. Even so, travel isn't difficult. The waterways have always been the best ways to get around. There are 117 waterways and more than 400 bridges that can guide you where you want to go.People in Venice move from place to place by boat. They like to enjoy the scenery and cool summer nights while taking boat trips. They can talk to other people as they go along. Venice grew out of small islands in saltwater lakes when some Italians escaped from a war more than 1,500 years ago, and built homes there. Water makes the city special, but it is also a big problem. Once, people used too much underground water. This made the city get lower little by little. Now the city has gone down by 23 centimeters. Another problem is the rising seawater. The temperature has risen over the years. This has made the ice of the Arctic Ocean melt . Every year, high waters hit the city in autumn and winter. When a lot of water comes, more than half of the city is underwater. Scientists are trying different ways to stop the city from getting even lower. ,.

How did the man feel when he saw the chicken keeping up with him?	"He was surprised to see that the chicken was keeping up with him. Looking at his speedometer , he found that he was doing 50 miles per hour (MPH). Then he drove at 60 MPH, and the chicken stayed right next to him. He sped up to 75 MPH and _ still kept up. The man then found that the chicken had three legs. Growing even more curious , he followed the chicken down a road and into a farm. He got out of his car and saw that all the chickens around him had three legs. He asked the farmer, ""What's up with the three-legged chickens?"" The farmer said, ""Well, whenever we have chicken for diner, everyone in the family fights over the legs, but there are only two. I have raised a kind of three-legged chicken. It's going to make me richer."" ""How do they taste?"" the man asked. The farmer said, ""Don't know yet, I haven't been able to catch one."""	['Surprised.']
How did the author finally make real friends at university?	"I grew up in a family that ate dinner together every evening. Although my parents enjoyed wine, they rarely drank during the week and always in moderation .As for myself,1 wasn't interested in alcoholic drinks and neither were my high school friends. So when I arrived on campus for my first year of university life, I was a bit shocked. Many different events had been organized for the freshmen, but they all had one thing in common-alcohol, and plenty of .it wanting to be left out, I joined a few of the events. But I always returned home early, feeling disappointed. Your personality, interests and experiences didn't matter at all, only how many alcoholic drinks you could absorb before passing out . It seemed shallow to me. I wanted to get to know my new coursemates, not how fast they. could down a pint of beer. Gradually, however, I realized that real friends don't judge you by how much you can drink and there were other ways of making friends. I joined a photography society, took a first aid course, and every weekend l went cycling with a coursemate. I found that by engaging in these activities and sharing the fun of learning new skills together in a group ,I formed much stronger bonds with my new friends than even the strongest alcoholic drinks could encourage. Another valuable lesson I learned is that it's perfectly okay to say ""No"" if you don't want to drink. However, in many Western societies, especially the UK, binge drinking has become the norm. Many people who drink don't necessarily want to, but they give in to the peer pressure -they're afraid to say ""No""."	['By joining people with common interests.']
Who invented the game of ping-pong?	"More than a hundred years ago, an American produced a game. He called it indoor tennis. The Americans were not interested in it at first so he sent it to his London friends and it became very popular in Britain. The game was then played across the dining-room table or on the floor with the net hung between two chairs. In the early days ,the balls were made of cork or rubber. The bats were made of wood. A few years later a hollow ball like the one we use today was invented. The game then quickly spread all over the world. An Englishman once made a bat covered with rubber. He first played the game in England and called it ""ping - pong"". ""Ping"" was the sound of the bat when it hit the ball, and ""pong"" was the sound of the ball when it hit the table."

According to the passage, the study of Jacob Baker and John E.Thomas has_.	"""Without the fog, London wouldn't be a beautiful city,"" the French painter Claude Monet wrote to his wife, Alice, during one of his long visits toprefix = st1 /EnglandfromFrance. Few Londoners would have agreed with his statement at the time, when the city was choked by the smog of the Industrial Revolution, but no one argues with the beauty of the color1ful skies he began painting there between 1899 and 1901. Pollution has never looked quite as attractive as when seen through Monet's eyes. Now there is evidence that Monet's images of London were not only Impressionist creations, but a result of highly accurate observation.According to a paper published by two environmental scientists, the paintings may ""provide useful information in the analysis of the London fogs and air quality during this period""--a period before pollution levels were routinely recorded. In their study, Jacob Baker and John E. Thomas of the University of Birmingham analyzed the position of the sun in 9 of the 19 paintings in Monet's ""House of Parliament"" series.There was ""a perfect correlation "", Thomas says, between the solar positions in the images, the actual solar positions from astronomical records and the dates on which Monet began the works. ""We believe,"" Thomas says, ""that we can basically work out how much smoke would have to be in the air to create that visibility and those color1s in, say, February 1900 through the images."" Some art historians doubt the London paintings hold this much documentary evidence, pointing out the Monet continued to work on many of the images after he returned to his studio in Giverny, France.They also argue that there's no question that Monet was astonishingly realistic to what lay in front of him, but at the same time, for example, he had a _ for pinks.He always was trying to put pinks into pictures throughout his career. Thomas admits that ""it's still just a hypothesis "" but maintains that ""we're fairly optimistic that we'll get something out of it"""	['been questioned by some art historians']

Two years later he raturned to his home town and found a job at the police station. People had known about his bravery by then and they all liked the polite young man. One day a few young men had drunk too much before they came in a cinema. They danced and sang there and the film couldn't be shown. Paul was ill that day and went to the hospital. When he was passing there, the young men were beating an old man. He went to stop them and they began to fight. He caught them all and sent them to the police station. Since then all the bad men in the town were afraid of the brave policeman. It was a summer evening. The weather was hot and few people could stay indoors. Paul was on duty and sat by the telephone. Suddenly in rushed a beautiful girl with a book in her hand. She stood there, shaking in her shoes. ""What's the matter, madam? ""asked Paul. ""I wish you could protect me sir, ""answered the girl.

The next day the girl came to tell that her parents agreed to her beginning work next Monday. But the examiner said regretfully,""Sorry, the job position is filled by another suitable candidate.

Babies born in summer are more likely to be shortsighted _ .	"Babies born in summer are more likely to become short-sighted in late life, a study has shown. As many as a quarter of all cases of short-sightedness are caused by too great an exposure to sunlight in the first weeks of life, say eye experts. They are advising all parents to put sunglasses on their babies during the first weeks. Scientists had already established that over-exposure to sunlight caused shortsightedness in animals. Researchers who compared the months in which babies were born with whether they needed glasses later on say the principle also applies to humans. A study of almost 300,000 young adults-the largest of its kind-showed that those born in June and July had a 25 per cent greater chance of becoming severely short-sighted than those born in December or January. Research leader Professor Michael Belkin, of Tel Aviv University, said it was because prolonged illumination causes the eyeball to lengthen-causing short-sightedness. Hence the more light a newborn is exposed to, the more the eyeball lengthens and the worse the short-sightedness will be. The mechanism which lengthens the eyeball is associated with levels of melatonin , a pigment which protects the skin against harmful rays of the sun. In young babies not enough melatonin is released as protection, meaning they are more _ to sunburn and changes to eyeball shape. Sight expert Professor Daniel O'Leary, of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said ""At the moment we don't know the precise cause of why light exposure affects sight, but the evidence seems to prove that it is one of the reasons for people becoming shortsighted."""

Many people see pollution as only part of .	People all over the world today are beginning to hear and learn more and more about the problem of pollution.Pollution is caused either by man's release of completely new artificial substances into the environment,or by releasing greatly increased amounts of a natural substance,such as oil from oil tankers into the sea. The whole industrial process which makes many of the goods and machines we need and use in our daily lives,is bound to create a number of waste products which upset the environmental balance,or the ecological balance as is also known.Many of these waste products can be prevented or disposed of.But while more and more new and complex goods are produced,there will be new,dangerous waste to be disposed of,for example,the waste products from nuclear power stations.Many people,therefore,see pollution as only part of a larger and more complex problem,that is,the whole process of industrial production and consumption of goods.Others again see the problem mainly in connection with agriculture,where new methods are helping farmers grow more and more on their land to feed our ever-increasing population.However,the land itself is gradually becoming worn out as it is being used,in some cases,too heavily,and artificial fertilizers can not restore the balance. Whatever its underlying reasons are,there is no doubt that much of the pollution caused could be controlled if only companies,individuals and governments would make more efforts.In the home there is an obvious need to control litter and waste.Food comes wrapped up three or four times in packages that all have to be disposed of;drinks are increasingly sold in bottles or tins which can not be reused.This not only causes a litter problem,but also is a great waste of resources,in terms of glass,metals and paper.Advertising has helped this process by persuading many of us not only to buy things we neither want nor need,but also to throw away much of what we do buy.Pollution and waste combine to be a problem everyone can help to solve by cutting out unnecessary buying,excessive consumption and careless disposal of the products we use in our daily lives.

Why did the doctor suggest the speaker translating the book?	Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, It's my honor to attend this conference. I hope to tell you, with my own experience, how I benefit from the rapidly developing information technology. I injured my neck and became disabled in a diving accident in May 1997. I was desperate then and even thought of killing myself. During that time, however, I met Ms. Yatani, a Japanese specialist, who was carrying out a teaching task there. She encouraged me and gave me an English copy of JONI before she returned to Japan. The book is the autobiography of Ms. Joni Earckson. Her experience was similar to mine. She injured her neck and became disabled in a diving accident in 1967. With a strong will, she tried very hard. Finally, she became a famous artist. From her story I found enlightenment and felt hopeful. My doctor, Dr. Guan, saw me reading the book. He suggested that I translate it into Chinese in order to benefit more disabled people in China. I agreed, and in one and a half months the translation was finished. Then I contacted Joni through the Internet for the copyright. It was then that I saw how useful modern information technology can be. Highly developed information technology brings me hope and makes my dreams come true. I am really lucky to live in the Age of Information. I could not imagine what my life would be like without it. It makes my life color1ful and more meaningful. I would like to give special thanks to Dr. Guan, and thanks to all of my friends who love and care for me. It is their love and efforts that helped to make my dreams come true. I hope to send my love and thanks to everyone in the world through the Internet. Thanks again!	"[""More people would be inspired by Joni's story.""]"

From the study we can know that _ .	In nowadays,people tend to get married late.Does it have advantage or disadvantage?Different people have different opinions.Now let's have a look at a telated study about Americans. A study has found that marrying later in life is generally financially benfeicial for women,but not for men. The University of Virginia has published a report that college-educated women who get married in their thirties earn an average of 56 percent more than those who wed a decade earlier. In contrast,men who settle down in their twenties have higher intomes than those who wait until after 30,whatever their education. The Natioal Marriage Project's study,with the title:The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America,examines the consequences of marrying later,a growing trend in the US. It notes that the average age of marriage is ag an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men,compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26for men. But while wome have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages,men who getmarried earlier in life tend to be more successful later on. The study says that childbirth plays a role in these results. Around tow-thirds of lifetime income growth takes place during the first ten years of a career,according to clinical psychologist Meg Jay. Since college-educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier,forcing them to take a break from their careers. But getting hiched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men,perhaps because married men are more sure of themselves and they have more responsibility for their family compared to single men ,leadng to more productivity,suggests Business Insider. The study also found that while college-deucated women profit from delayed marriage,those without a degree do not. In fact,among women who drop out of high school, 83 percent of first births are to unmarried mothers,according to the study. A woman without a college education therefore has less time to advance her career during ist vital first decade. The study also shows that men who never marry earn significantly less than those who do ,while the opposite is true for women.	['men usually earn more if they get married earlier']

_ makes the result of the election hard to predict.	The curtain on the 2008 US presidential election finally rose last month as John McCain and Barack Obama were formally nominated as candidates of the two major parties. This may be one of the hardest decisions voters have to make between two appealing candidates. The big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect? A young first-term senator promising change and new ideas, or a longtime senator with strong military experience and a reputation as a maverick ? American voters have never seen a candidate quite like Obama. He has a white mother from theprefix = st1 /USand a black father fromKenyawho left the family when Obama was very young. He spent part of his youth inIndonesia. His supporters say Obama's childhood gives him the advantage to repair the recent damage done toAmerica's image abroad. His opponents focus on his inexperience, noting he hasn't finished his first term in the Senate. However, McCain has a very different life story. He grew up in a Navy family and was a pilot during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. When Obama was in kindergarten in Indonesia, McCain's plane was shot down overVietnamand he became a prisoner of war. McCain could have been released if he _ Americabut he refused and so was held for five years. So in the end, the election may hinge on (...) several factors that are hard to judge: Will Obama's race matter to a significant number of voters? Will working-class whites who tended to support his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, vote for Obama? And perhaps most important of all, will swing voters be more drawn to Obama's vision or to McCain's experience? Whatever happens, one thing is clear: Whoever walks into the White House on January 20, 2009, will find enormous challenges waiting for him in the Oval Office, both at home and abroad.

Why are visitors recommended to visit Bedfordshire?	Bedfordshire had its fair share of royal visits from the early stages of the 10th Century onwards and the importance that the county placed on this is evident in the monuments, country houses, churches and any number of other structures that are still present there to this day. Bedford Castle is one of those structures and, although it is nowhere near its former glory today, it is an essential attraction to visit if you really want to grasp what its heritage means to the county! Bedford Castle was built _ as a fortress to help protect Bedfordshire on the south of the River Ouse after the people in the local towns and villages had already been subdued. It was erected in 919 on the orders of King Edward the Elder, although it was destroyed by a Danish invasion years later. This was when it was rebuilt as the castle, of which the ruins exist today! There is a long history behind the castle that involves several kings as a result of the Duke of Bedford being an ardent royalist. Bedford Castle repeatedly offered the kings of England refuge against various storms in the form of onslaughts from abroad and various domestic threats against them, and this is where much of its fame lies, even though the castle itself is no longer there. There are various tours of the ruins that you can take when you visit though and all of the guides are extremely knowledgeable. They will happily tell you tales of the mound and the castle that preceded it. The mound is open to the public all year round and is a proud part of the area's heritage. It is recommended by the majority of people that visit Bedfordshire because it tells you much about why the county is currently how it is. You can view the river from the mound and the surrounding settlements as well as the remains of the castle, and every moment spent there is worth it so enjoy the history and the very nature of the county itself!

The author felt hurt mainly because _ .	Carrying a passenger on a bicycle is an offence punishable by law. Everyone knows that but still some of us do it. I had done it many times before until something happened to teach me never to do it again. It was not the police. Rather it was an unforgettable, and unpleasant, experience. It happened one evening when my friend Segaran and I wanted to go and visit another friend who lived some distance away. I had a bicycle. Segaran did not. So, as usual, he sat side-saddle on the horizontal bar of the bicycle while I pedalled. We had done it many times before, so it should not be any problem. Near my friend's house, we got onto a gravel path made slippery by the recent rain. Still we managed to move along, thoroughly enjoying the rough ride. As we passed by a stream, I made the mistake of going too near the bank. The rain had softened the soil and it could not hold our combined weight. One moment we were going along merrily, the next we were tumbling head over heels into the stream. Splash! Splash! Splash! We plunged into the river bicycle first, followed by Segaran, then me. Normally the stream is only a few centimetres deep with clear water. When we fell in, it was a metre deep with smelly black water. The water prevented us from getting badly injured but we also had to pay the price of swallowing some of it. It tasted horrible. Segaran got the worst of it for being sandwiched between the bicycle and me. Our pride was far more hurt. We walked all the way home. I had to push the bicycle because its front wheel was bent out of shape. From that moment I promised never to carry anyone on a bicycle again.	['he failed in a thing he had thought was easy']
Which of the following can be the best title for the text?	"Raised in a motherless home, my father was extremely tightfisted towards us children. His attitude didn't soften as I grew into adulthood and went to college. I had to ride the bus whenever I came home. Though the bus stopped about two miles from home, Dad never met me, even in severe weather. If I _ he'd say in his loudest father-voice, ""That's what your legs are for!"" The walk didn't bother me as much as the fear of walking alone along the highway and country roads. I also felt less than valued that my father didn't seem concerned about my safety. But that feeling was cancelled one spring evening. It had been a particularly difficult week at college after long hours in labs. I longed for home. When the bus reached the stop, I stepped off and dragged my suitcase to begin the long journey home. A row of hedge edged the driveway that climbed the hill to our house. Once I had turned off the highway to start the last lap of my journey, I always had a sense of relief to see the hedge because it meant that I was almost home. On that particular evening, the hedge had just come into view when I saw something gray moving along the top of the hedge, moving toward the house. Upon closer observation, I realized it was the top of my father's head. Then I knew, each time I'd come home, he had stood behind the hedge, watching, until he knew I had arrived safely. I swallowed hard against the tears. He did care, after all. On later visits, that spot of gray became my watchtower. I could hardly wait until I was close enough to watch for its secret movement above the greenery. Upon reaching home, I would find my father sitting innocently in his chair. ""So! My son, it's you!"" he'd say, his face lengthening into pretended surprise. I replied, ""Yes, Dad, it's me. I'm home."""	"[""My Father's Secret.""]"
What can we learn from the passage?	"Once I complained to my husband that he wasn't helping enough with our daughter, and I gave him a long list of the parenting chores I was shouldering on my own. ""But you like doing all that stuff,"" he said. I thought about that while reading a new study about the responsibilities of parenting. Researchers asked 191 college professors, both men and women, who had children 2 or younger, the pleasure they experienced from childcare. On 16 out of 25 childcare tasks--like taking a child to the doctor or buying clothes for a child--women reported statistically higher levels of enjoyment than men. The only parenting issue that gave women less pleasure than it gave men was having to manage who does what for the child. On the whole, women's scores were 10 percent higher than men's. Women are also far more likely to take advantage of family-leave benefits to care for children. In the study, all the universities offered paid family leave, and 69 percent of the women took it, while only 12 percent of the men did. In Sweden, where family leave for both parents is particularly generous, men use about 20 percent of the 480-day benefit. Women use nearly all of it. It's difficult to know how cultural and economic pressures or biological functions influence parenting. Plenty of men change diapers , and studies show that mothers and fathers alike spend more time with children than they used to. Men have more than doubled the time they spend on childcare since 1985. Yet women still spend twice as much time with the kids as men, says the University of Maryland sociologist John Robinson. Notably in the study, the parenting activity that gave men the most pleasure (and women, too) was playing and talking with their kids. But when men were asked to rate how often they actually did those things, their scores were about 10 and 40 percent lower than women's. In the end, perhaps the issue is not that mothers are doing too many childcare tasks--my husband was right when he said I liked being a mother--but that men, for all their progress as fathers, are still missing out."

Which of the following is right about Dickens's pet Grip?	"In 2012, the Tower of London welcomed two new inhabitants: a pair of ravens named Jubilee and Grip. Their arrival celebrated the bicentenary of Charles Dickens's birth. This Grip was the third of the Tower ravens to be named after the novelist's own pet birD. One of his predecessors was resident during World War Two; he and his mate Mabel were the only ravens to survive a bombing attack on the Tower. Dickens's Grip, who had an impressive vocabulary, appears as a character in the author's fifth novel, Barnaby Rudge. On 28 January 1841, Dickens wrote to his friend George Cattermole: ""my notion is to have [Barnaby] always in company with a pet raven, who is immeasurably more knowing than himself. To this end I have been studying my bird, and think I could make a very distinctive character of him."" Unfortunately, just a few weeks after Dickens wrote that letter, Grip died, probably as a result of having stolen and eaten paint some months earlier. The bird had developed a strange habit - tearing sections off painted surfaces (including the family's carriage) and even drinking a quantity of white paint out of a tin. Dickens mourned his loss and wrote a humorous letter to his friend, the illustrator Daniel Maclise, about the raven's death. He related how, when Grip began to show signs of sickness, the vet was called and ""administered a powerful dose of castor oil"". Initially this seemed to have a positive effect and the author was thrilled to see Grip restored to his usual personality when he bit the coachman (who was used to the raven and took it in good humor). The following morning, Grip was able to eat ""some warm porridge"", but his recovery was short liveD. As Dickens wrote to Maclise, ""On the clock striking twelve he appeared slightly upset, but soon recovered, walking twice or thrice along the coach-house, stopped to bark, exclaimed 'Hello old girl' (his favorite expression) and dieD. He behaved throughout with a decent manner, which cannot be too much admireD. .. The children seem rather glad of it. He bit their ankles. But that was play."""	['he was quite ill before his death.']
Dr Smith concludes there probably aren't any aliens because other planets _ .	"Still waiting for little green men to make contact? _ . A leading astronomer has concluded there probably aren't any aliens out there - meaning we are absolutely alone in the universe. Even though there may be tens of thousands of other distant planets similar in size to Earth, the conditions on them are likely to be too hard to support life-forms such as ET. Dr Howard Smith, a senior astrophysicist at Harvard University, believes there is very little hope of discovering aliens and, even if we did, it would be almost impossible to make contact. So far astronomers have discovered a total of 500 planets in distant solar systems - known as extrasolar systems - although they believe billions of others exist. But Dr Smith points out that many of these planets are either too close to the sun or too far away, meaning their surface temperatures are so bad that they could not support life. Others have unusual orbits which cause vast temperature variations, making it impossible for water to exist - the most important thing for life. Dr Smith said, ""We have found that most other planets and solar systems are wildly different from our own. It means it is highly unlikely there are any planets with intelligent life close enough for us to make contact."" But his suggestions contradict other leading scientists who have claimed aliens almost certainly exist. Only last month Professor Stephen Hawking said the fact that there are billions of galaxies out there made it reasonable to think there were other life-forms in the universe. Researchers from the University of London have recently suggested that aliens could be living on as many as 40,000 other planets. But Dr Smith said: ""Any hope of contact has to be limited to a relatively tiny space around the Earth, reaching maybe 1,250 light years out from our planet, where aliens might be able to pick up our signals or send us their own. But communicating would still take decades or centuries."""	"[""don't have a suitable living environment""]"
Lucy played a role called _ in the TV play Pretty Little Liars.	"Do you know Pretty Little Liars ? It is one of the most popular American TV series right now. It is about the life of four girls after their best friend was killed. Lucy, one of the four girls, has more than a few secrets.

What can we learn from the story?	"A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet. He _ a sign which said, ""I am blind, please help."" There were only a few coins in the hat. A man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, ""Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?"" The man said, ""I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way."" What he had written was, ""Today is a beautiful day; I can not see it."" Of course both signs told people the boy was blind. But the first sign simply sign the boy was blind. The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. Should we be surprised that the second sign was more effective ?"	['Treating a thing differently brings a different result.']
As to energy use, the new research from UKERC stresses the importance of _ .	The behaviour of a building's users may be at least as important as its design when it comes to energy use, according to new research from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). The UK promises to reduce its carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, part of which will be achieved by all new homes being zero-carbon by 2016. But this report shows that sustainable building design on its own -- though extremely important- is not enough to achieve such reductions: the behaviour of the people using the building has to change too. The study suggests that the ways that people use and live in their homes have been largely ignored by existing efforts to improve energy efficiency , _ instead focus on architectural and technological developments. 'Technology is going to assist but it is not going to do everything,'explains Katy Janda, a UKERC senior researcher,'consumption patterns of building users can defeat the most careful design. 'In other words,old habits die hard, even in the best-designed eco-home. Another part of the problem is information. Households and bill-payers don't have the knowledge they need to change their energy-use habits. Without specific information,it's hard to estimate the costs and benefits of making different choices. Feedback facilities, like smart meters and energy monitors,could help bridge this information gap by helping people see how changing their behaviour directly affects their energy use; some studies have shown that households can achieve up to 15 percent energy savings using smart meters. Social science research has added a further dimension ,suggesting that individuals'behaviour in the home can be personal and cannot be predicted whether people throw open their windows rather than turn down the thermostat , for example. Janda argues that education is the key. She calls for a focused programme to teach people about buildings and their own behaviour in them.	['the behaviour of building users']
Which of the following expressions could be used to tell someone to stay away from your private affairs?	"The nose is used in many popular expressions. Some people are able to lead other people by the nose. For example, if a wife leads her husband by the nose, she makes him do whatever she wants him to do. Some people are said to be hard-nosed. They will not change their opinions or positions on anything. It is always helpful when people keep their nose out of other people's business. They do not interfere . The opposite of this is someone who noses around all the time. Such people are interested in other people's private matters. They're considered nosy. Someone who keeps his nose to the grindstone works very hard. This can help a worker keep his nose clean or stay out of trouble. One unusual expression is that is no skin off my nose. This means that a situation doesn't affect or concern me. We also say that sometimes a person cuts off his nose to spite his face. That is, he makes a situation bad for himself by doing something foolish because he is angry. More problems can develop if a person looks down his nose at someone or something. The person acts as if something is unimportant or worthless. This person might also turn up his nose at something that he considers not good enough. This person thinks he is better than everyone else. He has his nose in the air. In school, some students thumb their nose at their teacher. They refuse to obey orders or do any work. Maybe the students do not know the correct answers. My mother always told me when I was a student, ""If you study hard, the answers should be right under your nose or easily seen."""

How often should we change our toothbrushes?	Teeth are important. Strong , healthy teeth help you chew foods that help you grow. They help you speak clearly. And yes ,they help you look best. Here are some tips for you to take care of you teeth: 1. Brush your teeth the right way. Brush your teeth at least twice a day - after breakfast and before bedtime. If you can, brush after lunch or after sweet snacks, too. Brush all of your teeth, not just the front ones. Spend time brushing teeth along the sides and back of your mouth. Spend at least three minutes each time you brush. Play a song you like to help pass the time. Get a new toothbrush every three months. When you buy toothbrush, be sure it has soft bristles . 2. Learn how to floss your teeth.. Flossing is a very important way to keep your teeth healthy. Food may hide between two teeth. Flossing can help get rid of it. You'll need to floss your teeth at least once a day. 3. Have good eating habits. You need to be careful about what you eat and drink. Eating sugar is a major cause of tooth decay . Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and drink water instead of soda .	['every three months']
What do you know about CRP?	"They say that sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt you. Yet childhood bullying really can damage your long-term health. Gone are the days when bullying was considered an unavoidable and finally harmless part of growing up -- just last month we learned that childhood bullying can lead to poorer mental health even into middle age. Now William Copeland at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues have shown that it can have lasting physiological effects too. They tracked 1,420 nine-year-olds right through their teens. Each child was seen up to nine times during the study and asked about bullying. The team then measured levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in their blood. CRP is a marker of inflammation linked to higher risk of cardiovascular disease and problems like diabetes. ""Because we were collecting biological samples throughout, we were able to look at CRP levels in subjects _ their bullying involvement."" says Copeland. ""This really gives us an idea of the changes bullying brings about."" Although CRP levels naturally rise in everyone during adolescence, levels were highest in children who reported suffering from bullies. Even at the ages of 19 and 21, children who had once been bullied had CRP levels about 1.4 times higher than peers who were neither wrongdoers nor victims. In a cruel twist, the bullies had the lowest levels of all, suggesting they didn't suffer the same health risks. They may even see a benefit from their behavior, though Copeland stresses it doesn't defend their actions. ""The goal would instead be to find other ways to produce this protective effect without it being at someone else's expense."" he says. Andrea Danese at King's College London has before shown that ill-treatment during childhood can lead to high levels of inflammation in adult life. ""This new study is a helpful addition in showing that these effects extend to another important childhood stressor."" he says. He suggests that care workers monitor levels of CRP in children having psychotherapy to see if it is helping to reduce the stress of being bullied."	['It is a sign of the inflammation.']
What can we know about the author from the above passage?	Thanks for bringing me down here to the university last Sunday. Classes didn't start until Wednesday, so I had a few days to get adjusted. I'm signed up for five classes: zoology, calculus, English, and two history sections. It's a heavy load, but they are all courses that will count for my degree. The zoology class which meets at 8:00 every morning is going to be my hardest subject. The history class that I have in the morning is on Western Civilization; the one in the afternoon is on early prefix = st1 /United Stateshistory, our ancestors' life. Calculus which I have at noon every day looks like it's going to be easy. Besides zoology, the other class that's going to be hard is English, for you see, we have to do a composition a week. I like all of my classmates but one. There are four of us in our suite including two girls from Texas and a girl from Manitoba. Sally who is fromSan Antoniois great: I feel like I've known her all my life. I also really like Anne who is the girl fromManitoba. Heather the other girl fromTexasis kind of a pain, though; she's one of those types of people who never tell you what's bothering them and then get hostile. I don't know how to get along with her but I'll try my best to make friends with her. This I take as one other class I myself open. All in all, though, it looks like it's going to be a great year. I'll write again in a week or so.	['She may not good at writing.']
People like swimming in summer because _ .	"Swimming is very popular. People like swimming in summer because water makes people feel cool. If you like swimming but swim in a wrong place, it may not be safe. These years, a lot of people die when they enjoy themselves in water, and most of them are students. Some people are not careful when they are swimming. They often think they swim so well that nothing will happen to them in water. Summer is here again. If you go swimming, don't forget that better swimmers have died in water. They die because they are not careful, not because they cannot swim. So don't get into the water when you are alone.

What can we tell from the story?	"Smog is a big problem in many Chinese cities. But it seems that besides wearing a mask, few of us know what has caused the smog and what to do to beat it. Chai Jing, a former news interviewer with CCTV, discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome. The 103-minute film was on websites on Feb 28. In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog. To solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas. In her film, Chai also emphasized that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities , she calls the hotline 12369. The restaurant installed the filter a week later. Chen Jining, the new minister of environmental protection, praised Chai. ""This film encourages ordinary people to take notice of the environment. This is what we need in the future."""	['Living a green life can help reduce smog.']
How did the suthour feel about his street crossing?	"China is a land of bicycles.At least it was back in 1992 when I travelled the country.Back then everyone seemed to be riding a bicycle.Millions of them,all black.Cars were rare.Yet since my arrival in Beijing last year,I've found the opposite is true.There were millions of cars.However,people still use their bicycles to get around.For many,it's the easiest and cheappiest way to travel today. Bicycles also come in different colours---silver,green,red,blue,yellow,whatever you want. It's fun watching people biking. They rush quickly through crossroads,move skillfully through traffic,and ride even on sidewalks . Bicycles allow people the freedom to move about that cars just can't provide. Eager to be part of this aspect of Chinese culture, I decided to buy a bicycle. Great weather accompanied my great buy. I immediately jumped up on my bicycle seat and started to ride. My first ride home was orderly .To be safe,I stayed with a ""pack""of bikers while cars on the streets came running swiftly out of nowhere at times. I didn't want to get hit.So I took the ride carefully. Crossing the streets was the biggest problem. It was a lot like crossing a major highway back in the United States. The streets here were wide,so crossing took time,skill and a little bit of luck. I finally made it home. The feeling on the bicycle was amazing. The air hitting my face and going through my air was wonderful. I was sitting on top of the world as I passed by places and people.Biking made me feel alive."	['It was difficult.']
What are nitrates used for?	The food we eat seems to have profound effects on our health. Although science has made big steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that 80 percent of all human illness are connected with diet and 40 percent of cancer is connected with the diet. Therefore, that food is connected with illness is not a new discovery. In 1940's scientists realized that nitrates , which are often used to keep color1 of meat, and other additives caused cancer. However these additives remain in our food and it becomes more difficult to know which additives are helpful or harmful. Farmers sometimes give drugs to animals not because the animals are ill but because they want to sell the animals at higher prices. For example, farmers try hard to make animals grow big so that they can sell the big animals for more money. Although the Food and Drug Administration has tried again and again to control farmers to do so, farmers go on doing this.	['They keep the color1 of meat.']
From the text we know _ .	"We were driving from Los Angeles to Dallas,running low on gas somewhere in New Mexico and figured we'd see a gas station soon enough to fill up. But that didn't happen and we realized we wouldn't make it to the next town.So my daughter made up a sign that read""Low on gas.Can u help?"" and held it outside her window in the hopes that a driver in the next lane would notice it and stop. There weren't too many vehicles passing us either at the time.It was a lonely stretch of road and about 3:30 pm on a weekday.A suburban was driving along happily in the neighboring lane ahead of us.We caught up with it in the hopes the driver would notice the sign.After a brief expression of confusion on his face,he seemed to have noticed the sign and slowed down to pull over.We pulled over right behind him. He was friendly and was eager to help us.At first he thought we didn't have enough money to buy gas,so he offered to buy us gas at the next town Roswell that was about 10 miles away![:ZXXK] When we explained our _ of not having enough gas to get to Roswell,he said his farm was about 1 0 minutes away and they had a gas pump there,so if we could give him 20 minutes,he would head back there,get a can of gas and fill up our tank for us. We could not believe our good fortune ! There not being any cell phone reception for either of us in the area, we had just hoped that whoever stopped to help would be kind enough to call AAA when they got to Roswell and we would just wait it out for them to help us. We were filled with gratefulness for the kindness of strangers such as this person as we waited for him to return.Sure enough,he was back with the can and quickly filled our tank.He refused to take payment for the gas.Tears flowed,as did our endless appreciation."

What does the editor think of Jimmy's problem?	Dear Editor, I have just returned home after studying for a year in Germany. But it seems that my parents don't understand me now. They expect me to be the same person I was before I went abroad, but I'm not! Why can't they let me be myself? Jimmy Hi, Jimmy, As far as I know, people who have lived abroad often find that the adjustment to returning home is more difficult than their adjustment to living in a foreign culture. Why? We expect to have some problems when we go to a new place, speak a different language and learn the rules of a different culture ... But home? ... we know that place! Your parents expect that the same person who boarded the airplane one year ago will be returning. Especially if they have never been abroad themselves, your parents probably won't understand the changes that living abroad can cause in a person. On the other hand, you may have maintained an ideal mental image of your loved ones while abroad, an image that is broken into pieces when you return. Remember you have been living a different lifestyle in your host country, and you have probably become very independent while staying there alone. Now that you're home, you will be expected to conform again to the lifestyle of your family. As a result, you may be upset about your parents' involvement in your life. Communication is the key to overcoming this problem. Tell your parents how you are feeling. Share with them information about cultural re-entry , and ask them to be patient. This does not mean that you have to forget your experience and give up everything you've learned! Learn to find a balance between the old and new, just as you did when first adjusting to your host country's culture.	"[""It's normal.""]"
Some of the children are angry with their parents in the passage because _ .	"I don't like my parents. They always tell me I should do this, and should not do that. It sometimes makes me angry,"" said Liu Dan, a middle school student in Beijing. Do you have the same problem? Perhaps your parents had the same problem when they were your age long ago. Why does it seem that some parents are not so friendly in their children's eyes? One of the biggest things is when someone becomes a parent, he or she likes worrying things. They worry about everything about you from the time you were born. They do a lot for you, though something would make you angry, because they care about you and worry about you. They worry about your choice of friends, the food you eat, your work at school, how much sleep you get, etc. All these things are part of your life. They want you to grow up healthily and happily. So how can you make things easier on yourself? It's easier than you think. Just make sure your parents know what you're doing. Get them to know your friends. Call them if you stay somewhere else later than usual. Say sorry to them when you make mistakes. Take responsibility for what you have done. Talk about your ideas with them. They may talk about theirs with you. Most of all, try to think about why your parents do this or do that. They are still practicing being parents and need help you can give them. Someday, when you become a parent, they may be able to help you how to get on with your children."	['the children are limited by their parents']
According to the passage, these fast food restaurants are usually quite	There are more and more fast food chains all over the world now. Most of these places work on a similar principle .There is a long counter ,above which hangs a list(often with pictures)of the items they sell,and behind which several people (often students working for the lowest pay) are working. Buyers form queues in front of each assistant. You receive what you order and take it on a tray to a table. If you can't see any knives and forks, this means you should eat with your hands. If you can't see any straws ,that's because they are hiding in the straw machine and you have to press the button to get a straw. When you have finished, you yourself throw away everything except the tray. It seems that you should do almost everything while you are having food in this kind of restaurant. Many fast food places have drive-in facilities You place your order from your car through a microphone and then drive to a special window to pay and pick it up. You may even find places where a waitress brings your meal out, and you sit and eat it in the car from a tray hooked over the door through the open window.

Where does the passage come from ?	It's the dirty little secret many shampoo companies don't want you to know. When you wash your hair with certain traditional chemical shampoos, you may actually be removing your hair and scalp of their natural oils. These shampoos generate a thick bubble to clean hair, they can also create dryness, curl, dullness, and color fade. We then spend a lot of time and money on products that are effectively repairing the damage caused by shampoo. Chaz Dean got tired of clients leaving his salon _ t their color and the feeling of their hair---brassy and dull. He knew the main cause was likely their shampoo, so he started experimenting with various ingredients, including natural herbs and botanicals, that he knew had cleansing and hydrating properties. The result was a totally new approach to the way we cleanse our hair. It's called WEN(r) Cleansing Conditioner. WEN(r) contains a super-hydrating natural herbs and botanicals mixture of glycerin, chamomile , rosemary, calendula, and Cherry bark, which when combined, will both cleanse the hair as well as give shine and softness, even to damaged hair. WEN(r) is a 5-in-1 formula that takes the place of your shampoo, And the most amazing thing about it is that it cleanses without bubble. Instead, when mixed with water, it creates a smooth bubble for shiny, healthy-looking, manageable results. The first time you try it certainly feels strange, but the results speak for themselves. Before being marketed, WEN(r) went through extensive consumer tests, and the results were impressive. More than 90 percent of the participants in the studies reported that their hair was more shiny, less frizzy, and had more bounce. WEN(r) is recommended for all hair types, and once you start using it, it will become the only cleanser/conditioner you will want to include in your daily routine. Right now, WEN(r) is offering an easy way for online shoppers to try the product. Now you just pay less than $30 and have a 60 day money back guarantee if you are not completely satisfied.

Scientists are lately getting interested in the following except _ .	"Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it? Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper. Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse. ""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there."" Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works. Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations."" Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back."" Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that."" Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too."	['favoring eyesight and hearing']

I always promised myself that I'd get out as soon as possible. Now, at age 20, I have a good job and a nice house, and I'm really proud of the independence I've achieved. Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine--so much so that they make mine theirs. It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me. But now they seem to take it for granted that they can show up any time they like. They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes--it makes the place feel comfortable and warm--but this is my home, not a party house. I was old enough to move out on my own, so why can't I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ? Joan Edward's reply to Joan Dear Joan, If your family didn't pay attention to your needs when you were a child, you probably have trouble letting others know your needs now. And if you've gathered your friends around you to rebuild a happy family atmosphere , you may fear that saying no will bring back the kind of conflict you grew up with--or destroy the nice atmosphere you now enjoy. You need to understand that in true friendship it's okay to put your own needs first from time to time. Be clear about the message you want to send. For example, ""I really love your company but I also need some privacy. So please call before you come over. "" Edward"	['her family experience stops her from doing so']
What is the best title of the passage ?	"""We don't necessarily believe that new advertising, which might make consumers feel better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,"" Morgan Stanley's Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic, and is banking on a new slogan: ""Welcome to the Coke side of life."" BREAK THROUGH HIT? With PepsiCo about to surpass Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street--Pepsi's market capitalization has _ in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival--the heat is on Coke . It's set to launch a new marketing campaign in March, 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke's investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York, my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction . Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda--Coke's stronghold --and into alternative beverages like juice, tea, and water, Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit. And given that shift away from soda, some analyists wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke. SAME OLD, UPDATED? The new flavors of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PepsiCo's Gatorade brand. And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging, including new, aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs, and an 8.4-ounce ""100 calorie"" version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse. I doubt whether other new products will be successful, including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Black that I tried. Think carbonated coffee. But I'm not sure if the product, which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set, is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix. And my opinion is that Vault, an orange-flavored energy drink, will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke's last attempt, a product called Surge. If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year, it appears that many of them are simply new brands, not new products."	['Troubles in Coke Company']
It can be learned from the passage that cheerleading	"Cheerleading is the fastest growing girls' sport, yet more than half of Americans do not believe it is a sport. Actually, competitive cheerleading is a sport. A sport is a ""physical activity against/with an opponent, governed by rules and conditions under which a winner is declared, and the primary purpose of the competition is a comparison of the relative skills of the participants. ""Because cheerleading follows these guidelines, it is a sport. Competitive cheerleading includes lots of physical activities. Like gymnasts, cheerleaders must learn to tumble . They perform lifts and tosses. This is where the ""flied' are thrown in the air, held by "" _ "" in different positions that require strength and cooperation with other teammates. Just as basketball and football have guidelines for competitive play, so does competitive cheerleading. The whole routine has to be completed in less than 3 minutes and 15 seconds and the cheerleaders are required to stay within a certain area. Competitive cheerleaders' goal is to be the best. Just like gymnasts, they are awarded points for difficulty, creativity and sharpness. The more difficult a mount, the sharper the motions, the better the score. Cheerleading is a team sport so without cooperation, first place is out of reach. Cheerleading is the number-one cause of serious sports injuries to women. Emergency room visits for cheerleading are five times the number of those for any other sport, partially because they do not wear protective gear. While many athletes are equipped with hip pads or helmets, smiling cheerleaders are tossed into the air and spiral down into the arms of trusted teammates. The fliersmust remain tight at all times so that their bases can catch them safely. Also, because cheerleading is not yet recognized as a sport by many schools, neither proper matting nor high enough ceilings are provided to ensure safety. Instead, the girls use whatever space is available. More recognition of competitive cheerleading as a sport would decrease the number of injuries. So why do many Americans not think cheerleading is a sport? Some people argue that cheerleaders are just ""flirts in skirts"" with their only job to entertain the crowd, but cheerleaders today work just as hard as other athletes. Hopefully, cheerleading will become as well-known a sport as football and basketball, and even appear in the Olympics since cheerleaders are just as athletic and physically fit as those involved in the more accepted sports."

The new camera made by Netatmo can _ .	"A new camera made by a company named Netatmo has facial recognition software that can tell parents at work that their children have returned from school, or that a package has been taken to their home. It can also tell them if a stranger has entered their home. Janina Mattausch is a product marketing manager for Netatmo. ""The common security cameras at present are not that smart. So, they can tell you if something is moving but they don't necessarily know if it's a human being or, ah, if it's your kids --they don't know the difference, so they will warn you all the time. "" When family members enter a home, the new camera ""recognizes"" ( ) them and sends information to the owner's smartphone. The owner can choose to see the video then or latcr. But if an unknown person enters a home, the camera will send the owner a warning that will cause an alarm to sound on the owner's smartphone. That is what happened recently to a smart home camera owncr named Darrmen. He lives in Paris. ""On a Friday I was at work,atending a big monthly meeting when my phone warned. At first I told myself 'Oh, it must be a mistake, maybe I have to set the systcm again.

Why does Gold think people should not use cellphones at table?	"It's become part of the restaurant table setting: knife, fork, napkin and cell phone. Distracted dining is the new concern with customers constantly texting friends, uploading a Weibo photo of the meal they're about to chew down or emailing the boss. For many smart-phone users, it's hard just to focus on the meal and company at hand. Now, one restaurant in Los Angeles is giving diners a reason to turn off the digital world, by offering customers willing to check their phones at the door a 5-percent discount on their bill. Owner and chef Mark Gold of Eva Restaurant, located on Beverly Boulevard near N. Gardner Street, hopes this gives customers a way to truly sit back and relax, enjoy their meal and actually talk with friends and family in person. ""For us, it's really not about people disturbing other guests. Eva is home, and we want to create that environment of home, and we want people to connect again,"" he explained. ""It's about two people sitting together and just connecting, without the distraction of a phone, and we're trying to create an atmosphere where you come in and really enjoy the experience and the food and the company."" Gold said applying the suggestion reminds him to avoid cell phone usage, too. ""I'm guilty of it as well. When my wife and I go to dinner it seems like the cell phone is part of the table setting now. Every table you look at, it's a wine glass, the silverware and the cell phone,"" he joked. The husband and wife team runs Eva, a 40-person space with European flair. Gold said a little less than half take advantage of the deal, and no one has gotten upset about it. ""I think once the server approaches the table and they're presented with the offer, they like the idea of actually talking to each other again,"" he said."

The writer's friend lost her husband _ .	The story below is a true story that happened in September. During the month of September, a dear friend of mine lost her husband suddenly in an accident. The _ was a great shock to everyone. This accident was sudden and certainly unexpected. It made me realize the fact that you just don't know when a loved one is no longer going to be with you. We sometimes take our loved ones for granted ,and we expect that they will be with us all the time. However, as we all know, life does not work that way and sometimes we get a wake-up call that shocks us and makes us stand back and realize how short life is. To cheer her up, I tried to imagine if I were in her shoes how I would feel. It was impossible to imagine what she was going through. What words could I say to help her?Sometimes words just can't express our feelings. Sometimes our actions are much more meaningful than words. So I gave her a hug ... Life is too short, and we should treasure every day staying with our loved ones.	['in autumn']
It can be inferred that _ is one of the policymakers who believe that humans are not to blame for global warming.	"The environmental group 350.org has launched a new campaign called Climate Name Change that proposes to revise to how hurricanes are named: call them after policymakers who say that humans are not to blame for global warming. This will save the Katrinas and Sandys of the world from the injustice of having their names attached to major disaster, the group says. And, as a bonus, it will produce some peculiar weather reports. ""Rick Perry leaves trail of death,"" appears under a broadcast titled ""Rick Perry: The Tragedy."" ""Michelle Bachman is incredibly dangerous. If you value your life, please seek shelter from Michelle Bachman,"" says an official while addressing a news conference. The campaign is unlikely to influence the World Meteorological Organization, which has since 1954 named Atlantic tropical storms from an official list. But the campaign's goal seems less to actually name a hurricane after the speaker of the house, and more to call attention to an issue that this month has reached an alarming level of seriousness. The campaign comes just a month before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release its most recent report on the state of global warming and a week after a draft of the report was given away to Reuters. In the draft, scientists concluded with near certainty - about 95 percent sure - that humans are to blame for the worldwide temperature hikes over the last few decades. That was a revision from the 2007 report, which put scientific certainty that human activities were driving global climate change at about 90 percent. And global warming, the report said, is not slowing down - it, actually, is accelerating. That means that sea levels could balloon upward as much as three feet by the end of the century, if emissions continue at their current pace. Still, as the Washington Post Climate notes, hurricanes are not the best sign of global warming. Though current data suggests that global warming will in the future stir up terrible super storms, there is still not enough evidence to support the idea that climate change strengthens the recent hurricanes that have torn at the US's eastern coastline."

What is the best title of this passage?	"Drinking alcohol is a socially acceptable behavior in many parts of the world. Some medical experts say light drinking may even be good for your health, especially for the heart. But they say such health benefits should be compared to the many health risks connected with alcohol use. Some research suggests that having one to two drinks of alcohol a day may offer some health benefits. Several large studies have shown that this type of moderate drinking may lower the risk of heart disease and other diseases. A study last year suggested that drinking small amounts of red wine may help lower the risk of breast cancer in women. Researchers at Medical Center in California studied 36 women. Each woman drank a glass of red or white wine every day for almost a month. Researchers collected blood samples from the women two times a month to measure their hormone levels. The next month the women who drank red wine were told to drink white wine instead. The white wine drinkers were told to drink red wine. The researchers found that the women who drank red wine had lower levels of the female hormone than the white wine drinkers. They said red grapes have chemicals that may help to lower the risk of breast cancer. However, recent studies suggested that even small amounts of alcohol may generally increase the risk of breast cancer in women. They found that women who drink four small glasses of wine a week increase their risk of breast cancer by 15 percent. Many studies have examined the harmful effects of alcohol use on the body. Alicia Ann Kowalchuk serves as medical director, saying ""Healthy use for adults --- that's men under age 65 --- is no more than 4 drinks in a day and no more than 14 drinks in a week. And for women of all ages, it's no more than 7 drinks in a week and no more than 2 drinks in a day."" She says too much alcohol use has been linked to liver diseases, and many other cancers."

What is the best title of the passage?	"I was having a great morning until I sat down in front of my office computer. ""Your password has run out,"" a server message flashed on my screen, with instructions for changing it. Coming up with a new code doesn't seem like a big deal unless you work at my company, where we have to change it monthly, using at least one uppercase character, one lowercase character, one symbol, and one number. Oh, and the whole thing can't be fewer than eight characters. And I can't use any of the same passwords I've used in the past three months. Suddenly I was cross. What didn't make it any better was that I was deeply depressed after my recent divorce. The flashing cursor was still waiting for me to type a password that I'd have to re-enter many times for the next 30 days. I remembered a tip from my former boss: I'm going to use a password to change my life. I decided to choose a password, which would remind me that I shouldn't let myself be a victim of my recent breakup and that I was strong enough to do something about it. I made my password Forgive@h3r. I had to type this statement several times a day. Each time my computer would lock. Each time my screen saver with her photo would appear. Each time I would come back from eating lunch alone. In my mind, I wrote ""forgive her"" every day. The simple action changed the way I looked at my ex-wife. That constant reminder led me to accept the way things had happened at the end of my marriage and adopt a new way of dealing with my depression. As the month wore on, I felt slow healing began to take place. By the time my server reminded me to reset my password the following month, I felt free."	['How a Password Changed My Life']
Which of the following could be the best title of the passage?	"Hundreds of people lined up at Grand Central Terminal yesterday, but they weren't there to catch a train. They came to New York City's famous railroad station to trade in old dollar bills for the new George Washington Presidential1 coin. The gold-colored coin is the first in a new series by the U.S. Mint that honors former U.S. Presidents. The Mint will issue four Presidential1 coins a year through 2016. Like the popular 50 State Quarters program, which issues coins in the order in which each state joined the Union, Presidential1 coins will come out in the order in which each President served. The George Washington coin is the first to be released. John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison coins will come out later this year. The Presidential 1 coins will be the same size and color as the Sacagawea Golden Dollar. However, there is an important difference. For the first time since the 1930s, there is an inscription on the edge of each coin. Each coin will show a different President on its face, or head side. It will also show the President's name, the order in which he served and his years in office. The other side of the coin will show the Statue of Liberty and the inscriptions ""United States of America"" and "" 1"". There will be one Presidential1 coin for each President, except Grover Cleveland. He will have two! Cleveland is the only U.S. President to have served two nonconsecutive terms. The last President scheduled to get a coin is Gerald Ford because a President must have been dead for two years before he can be on a coin."	['Presidential1 coin issued.']

Which of the statements is true according to the passage?	"""Before you fall in love, you'd better get a job"" As told by Lee Joon-ho, 20, a senior in law at Seoul National University Korean TV dramas have shown a lot of rebellious youth, but in fact most students still live a traditional life. Confucianism has a great influence on us. For instance, Confucius said that we should be dutiful to our parents and value the family. Thus we prefer a school that's close to home so we can go back every day. Also as a result of Confucianism, teachers enjoy a high status in Korea. The other day, my professor was flying to Vienna on a business trip. Instead of waiting for hours in the queue, he was told to check in first and didn't have any problem with overweight luggage. When it comes to important decision-making, such as choosing a university, a job, and a wife, we listen to our parents' suggestions. Most parents seem _ in study decisions, but they take a firmer attitude towards their children's love and marriage choices. Often, a man has to have his own business or a solid career before he's allowed to pursue romance. Male chauvinism is popular among our parents' generation, since they had to support the whole family through hard work. We need to shoulder the same responsibility, but we've also learned to respect women, as they're doing outstanding work in lots of areas. But to be honest, my friends and I still prefer a traditional woman as a girlfriend and future wife. We want her to be elegant and thoughtful in taking care of a family. Our sense of tradition is also reflected in our buying habits. In my house, you see only Korean appliances. Although European cell phones are available in ROK, we favor LG and Samsung, which are suited more to our tastes and widely promoted in TV dramas and films."

What can we infer from the passage?	"Whether it's a carol service or an evening of karaoke in the pub, many people will enjoy a good old singsong this Christmas. Singing aloud will not just lift the spirits---it's good for your physical health as well. Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health. For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. ""Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch ."" Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress. ""And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect. It increases our sense of satisfaction with ourselves, a greater sense of feeling included. "" Helen Astrid, a singing teacher, also sees the great effects that singing brings. ""It lifts us up on a spiritual level, it helps our self-respect, and it's great for all ages from small kids to grannies--you can have a good sing and _ .""

What is the purpose of the text?	"""Mind your own business."" we're told.""Don't talk about others behind their backs.""The problem with this advice is that,not only is it unrealistic,it's also counterproductive . Common sense holds that gossip hurts people's feelings and damages relationships.But recent research shows the opposite--that strong communities and relationships between people would be impossible without gossip. Gossip is a way for people to let you know the limits of social behavior.""If you move into a community and your neighbor tells you how the former homeowner never dealt with his rubbish properly,his gossip is letting you in on something,""says Dr.Ralph Rosnow of Temple University.""Gossip says:these are the boundaries and you are crossing them.You're not _ the rules and you'd better get back in line."" Seen this way,gossip is a way to communicate criticism without conflict ,giving you a chance to change your behavior without losing face. On the other hand,what about ill-willed gossip,the kind that puts other people down? Gossip is hearing something we like about someone we don't and,in nearly every country in the world,gossip magazines have huge numbers of readers.According to researchers,however,this kind of gossip also has a good side because it helps us put our own problems in perspective .""If we read bad news about well-known people,or get the frightful details of our neighbors' bad situation over a cup of coffee,our own problems begin to pale in comparison ,""says Dr.Jack Levin of Northeastern University. However,that doesn't mean that gossip is necessarily a good thing,either.Researchers found that people who gossip a lot tend to feel like they're under a lot of stress.This might be because while they're busy talking about other people,they're also busy thinking what other people are saying about them."

In which category did Obama win his best place?	"President Obama ranks 15th out of 44 in a poll of the best and worst Presidents while former President George W. Bush earns a place in the bottom five, according to the Siena College Research Institute's recent survey released Thursday Obama won a top ten place in two skill set categories, communication ability (7th) and ability to compromise (10th), and in two personality trait categories, imagination (6th) and intelligence (8th). Background, described as family, education, and experience, proved his lowest score at 32nd. This is the 5th time the institute has conducted the survey of U.S. presidents, which is done a year after a new president takes office. The first survey was done in 1982. ""Obviously, there's not great _ to the poll since the Presidents have only been in office for one year,"" says the survey's co-director and statistician Douglas Lonnstrom. ""But it's a benchmark for us to see how they move."" Presidents tend to rank around 20th while they are in office, and Obama is no exception. His actions over the next few years will decide if he stays roughly the same like Reagan--who moved from 16th to 20th, 22nd, 16th again, and finally to 18th this year--or like Bush, who fell from 23rd to 39th. Franklin D. Roosevelt has held his title as top president since 1982 with the same four following as top five: Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. The survey, which ranks Presidents using 20 different factors, shows Jefferson was the most intelligent president, Richard Nixon was the worst at honesty and avoiding serious mistakes, Lincoln had the best overall ability, and Washington was the best leader."

According to the passage, China's food industry has a problem of faking and cheating because _ .	"You may never think a documentary film could have aroused so much public enthusiasm in Chinese history. Nowadays everybody is talking about a new 7-part documentary called A Bite of China which was recently broadcast late at night on CCTV I. The documentary describes various _ across the vast Chinese culinary landscape. According to Taobao, China's biggest online retail website, just five days after the series began to air, nearly 6 million people went to the site in search of various local specialties, particularly those mentioned in the documentary. More than 7.2 million deals were concluded. A ham producer from Yunnan Province saw his sales grow 17-fold in five days. However, one can't help but believe that the documentary's popularity is probably linked to the endless stream of terrible food security issues that have emerged in recent years. In one well-received article, a netizen wrote, ""I wonder how many felt so empty-hearted and sighed after watching the film. Blue-vitriol watered chive, formaldehyde sprayed cabbage, Sudan Red colored salty eggs, restaurants using gutter oil. The list is long..."" How will a varied and ancient food culture that is famous worldwide and which should have made the Chinese proud end? Food is the most vital thing in people's lives. Yet China's food industry has made people a little worried due to some severe food safety crisis. The market is huge while the cost of faking and cheating is so low for immoral businessmen; and the punishment is too light. Take the milk industry as an example. Although Sanlu, the company that sold the melamine-adulterated milk powder, was punished, thousands of other dairies didn't work hard to improve the quality. Therefore, food safety problems should be an important concern of Chinese government so that our ancient food culture can be preserved. As the documentary shows, people are attracted not to gourmet items like matsutake, a species of rare mushroom grown naturally in remote forests, but to common Chinese dishes like barley, lotus root or tofu. They are what meet our basic needs. This explains why people are so excited about A Bite of China---it is a reminder that there is still a world out there where food is excellent and safe."

The passage aims to convey that _ .	"We know that hugs make us feel easy inside. And this feeling, it turns out, could actually _ stress and protect r the immune system, according to a new research from Carnegie Mellon University. It's a well-known fact that stress can weaken the immune system. In this study, the researchers sought to determine whether hugs----like social support more broadly ----could protect individuals from the increased sensitivity to illness brought on by the particular stress that come with interpersonal conflict. ""We know that people experiencing ongoing conflicts with others are less able to fight off cold viruses. We also know that people who report having social support are partly protected from the effects of stress on psychological states, such as depression and anxiety, ""the study's lead author, psychologist Dr. Sheldon Cohen , said in a statement. ""We tested whether awareness of social support is equally effective in protecting us from sensitivity to infection caused by stress and also whether receiving hugs might partially account for those feeling of support and thus protect a person against infection."" In the experiment , over 400 healthy adults filled out a questionnaire about their perceived social support and also participated in a nightly phone interview for two weeks . They were asked the frequency they engaged in interpersonal conflicts and received bugs that day.[:++Z+X+X+K] Then, the researchers exposed the participants to a common cold virus, and monitored them to assess signs of infection. They found that both perceived social support and more frequent hugs reduced the risk of infection associated with experiencing interpersonal conflict. Regardless of whether or not they experienced social conflicts, infected participants with greater perceived social support and more frequent hugs had less severe illness symptoms. ""This suggests that being hugged by a trusted person may act as an effective means of conveying support and that increasing the frequency of hugs might be an effective means of reducing the effects of stress,"" Cohen said. ""The apparent protective effect of hugs may result from the physical contact itself or hugging being a behavioral indicator of support and closeness. Either way, those who receive more hugs are somewhat more protected from infection."" If you need any more reason to go wrap your arms around someone special, consider this: hugs also lower blood pressure, reduce fearsome around death and dying, improve heart health and decrease feeling of loneliness."

"There is a new type of small advertisement becoming increasingly common in newspaper classified columns.It is sometimes placed among ""situations vacant"", although it does not offer anyone a job, and sometimes it appears among ""situations wanted"", although it is not placed by someone looking for a job, either.What it does is to offer help in applying for a job. ""Contact us before writing your application"", or ""Make use of our long experience in preparing your curriculum vitae or job history"", is how it is usually expressed.The growth and apparent success of such a specialized service is, of course, a reflection on the current high levels of unemployment.It is also an indication of the growing importance of the CV, with the suggestion that it may now qualify as an art form in its own right.

Why did the author live a hard life at the age of twelve?	"When I was 12 years old, I was at a very hard stage in life.

Night after night, I would try my best to impress ""my coach"".Unfortunately, I just felt like a terrible disappointment to my mother. One summer afternoon, my mother told us we were going to visit Uncle David. Since we lived in an apartment, going to the country was quite a treat. My uncle David always had a way of making me feel special. When we arrived, my uncle and cousin Jeff were throwing metal rings at two holes in the ground. I was curious about what they were doing so I went over to watch. Noticing that I was standing there, my uncle asked if I had ever played washers. Being a ""city girl"", my reply was that the only ""washers"" I knew were the ones that cleaned clothes. To my embarrassment, Uncle David, chuckling ,explained that the metal rings were called washers. I was shocked to hear my uncle saying he wanted me to take his place. He then gave me the washers and gave tips on how to throw better. Unwillingly, I joined Jeff. Gradually, I found myself not only enjoying but also wanting to win this game. The washer went into the air and began to fall. Then a cloud of dust appeared as the washer sank into the hole. My first try! I had actually thrown the washer into the hole! Although 23 summers have gone by since that day, this small success in washer playing helped me get back self confidence lost when I struggled with the game of softball."

"Located in the forests near the village of Harads in northern Sweden, the Treehotel opened its doors in the summer of 2010 and offers six guest rooms.Owners, Britta and Kent Lindvall, invited designers and architects to create a series of unique tree houses that reflect the growing popularity of ecologically-themed holidays. There's the Mirrorcube, a 4x4x4 meter aluminum box in mirrored glass.Accessed via a footbridge, the Cabin is suspended from the surrounding pines on a steep bank, affording views of the Lulea River.Both these rooms sleep two people while the Nest (covered in branches), the Blue Cone (which is actually painted red) and the UFO (a spaceship skewered by pines) all have enough room to sleep a family of four.

How many sources of power do most hybrid cars use?	"Today's drivers may feel shocked by the high price of petrol when they drive to the gas station. However, the car industry has the technology to solve _ . It's the hybrid car . What is a hybrid car? Any car that uses two or more sources of power is a hybrid car. Most hybrid cars on the road right now are petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is just what it sounds like -- a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car. A gas-powered car has a fuel tank , which supplies petrol to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provides electricity for the car. To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to run at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be capable of being refueled quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with the other traffic on the road. A petrol car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. An electric car, however, produces almost no pollution, but can only go 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between recharging . And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to recharge. A petrol-electric car combines the advantages of the two power sources into one system that uses both gas power and electric power.

Where would you be most likely to find the passage?	"Using a computer or smartphone at night can cause us to pile on the pounds,new research has revealed. The study found a link between blue light exposure(blue light is produced by smartphones and computers)and increased hunger.It found that exposure to blue light increases hunger levels for several hours and even increases hunger levels after eating a meal.Blue light exposure has also already been shown to cause decreased sleepiness in the evening,increasing the risk of sleeplessness. The leading researcher,Ivy Cheung,from Northwestern University in Chicago,said,""A single three-hour exposure to blue-enriched light in the evening greatly affected hunger and metabolism .These results are important because they suggest that controlling environmental light exposure for humans may represent a _ approach of influencing food intake patterns and metabolism."" The study group consisted of 10 healthy adults with regular sleep and eating schedules. They completed a four-day trial under dim light conditions,which involved exposure to less than 20 lux(,)during 16 hours awake and less than 3 lux during eight hours of sleep.On the third day they were exposed to three hours of 260 lux,blue-enriched light starting10.5 hours after waking up.and the effects were compared with dim light exposure. Ivy Cheung said more research is needed to determine the functions involved in the relationship between light exposure,hunger and metabolism."	['In a health magazine.']

How does Kenji Croman make a living?	"Kenji Croman has broken his bones,his shoulder and elbow, and nearly drowned several times.He's also had three close encounters with sharks over the years.A 10-foot wave landed directly on top of him five years ago,bending his body to the point that he actually kicked himself in the head.""I literally heard every bone in my body crack.""he said. Croman has been photographing ocean waves since 2008,sometimes risking his life to get that perfect shot at the surf break.Despite the risks and certain injuries that come with wave photography, the Hawaii resident,body surfer and former competitive swimmer wouldn't do anything else.The 36-year-old photographer loves the thrill of meeting breaking waves head on,shooting waves as his interest and shooting surfers to pay the bills. The process of photographing waves requires more than just swimming out to where the surf breaks and waiting,he says.The night before a photo shoot Croman checks Surfline.com,a website and the coastal camera network that provides live and predicted ocean weather information,to see what the winds,waves and tide will be like at certain times.Croman has both a primary camera and a backup for emergencies.He goes without a wetsuit and uses heavy duty underwater housing to protect his camera.There is no great way for him to protect himself.He admits there are probably protective clothes he should be wearing,but there is little he could have done to decrease the impact of the 10-foot wave that crashed on top of him. The hardest part of Croman's job is staying calm in the face of breaking waves when his initial reaction is to panic and swim away.At most.Croman will take two to three shots of a single wave.""I've shot waves for so many years now that I see the wave in slow movement,""he said."

Parenting experts are worried that _ .	"CHICAGO ---Call it a reward, or just ""bribery "". Whichever it is, many parents today readily admit to buying off their children, who getgoodies for anything from behaving in a restaurant to sleeping all night in their own beds. That's what worries parenting experts. ""I think that reward systems have a time and a place and work really well in certain situations,"" says Marcy Safyer, director of the Adelphi University Institute for Parenting. ""But what often gets lost for people is being able to figure out how to communicate to their kids that doing the thing is rewarding enough,"" Safyer says. Parents and experts alike agree that thedynamic is partly a reflection of the world we live in. It's unrealistic to think a parent wouldn't reward their children with material things sometimes, says Robin Lanzi, a clinical psychologist and mother of four who's the research director at the Center on Health and Education at Georgetown University. ""But you want to make sure that they match the behavior, so it's not something huge for something small,"" Lanzi says. She recalls hearing about a father who offered his child a Nintendo Wii game system for scoring a couple goals in a soccer game. Elizabeth Powell, a mother of two young daughters in Austin, Texas, knows what she means. ""You want to raise them in a way that they're respectful and appreciate things,"" Powell says of her children. ""But sometimes, you wonder now if kids appreciate even a new pair of shoes.

What does the author learn about science from his experience?	What a Scientist Is Like If you were asked to imagine a scientist, what image would come to your mind? The common idea that most kids from kindergarten through college have of a scientist is a man wearing a white lab coat with messy hair, big glasses, and several glass cups of mysterious color1ful liquids giving off clouds of smoke. As for adults, the majority view scientists as strange people who spend 100 hours a week slaving away in a lonely laboratory. However, the reality is quite different. Recently I've had a chance to take part in a scientific experience far from my laboratory and into Costa Rica. It supports a huge amount of wildlife due to its geographical placement between North and South America. It is home to more than 500,000 species ,which represents nearly 4% of the total species worldwide! First we worked alongside conservationists to preserve wildlife at a leatherback turtle ( )rescue center. We helped the volunteers preserve turtle populations by removing rubbish from the shoreline to create a safe environment for turtle eggs to come out. After that we stayed at Mount Arenal where we studied seismic activity relating to earthquakes. During our stay at Arenal, we rode over the mountainous areas and took a long walk through the rainforest. After reaching the top, we went down and through waterfalls to the beautiful valley below! On the last day we got a hands-on introduction to rocket science where we learned about new rocket technology that will be used on the international space station. During my Costa Rica experience, I know that being a scientist doesn't mean working in a lab all day and night. A scientist is one who loves learning and getting a better understanding of the world from helping preserve wild-life, learning about earthquakes or inventing rockets. I think that schools should really stress that science is so much more than wearing a lab coat and mixing chemicals. Kids need to be aware of the excitement and adventures science can bring!

The headmaster asked the older boys to _ .	"I still remember--my hands and my fingers still remember--what used to lie in store for us on our return to school from the holidays. The trees in the school yard would be in full leaf again and the old leaves would be lying around like a muddy sea of leaves. ""Get that all swept up!"" the headmaster would tell us. ""I want the whole place cleaned up, at once!"" There was enough work there, to last over a week. Especially since the only tools with which we were provided were our hands, our fingers, and our nails. ""Now see that it's done properly, and be quick about it,"" the headmaster would say to the older pupils, ""or you'll have to answer for it!"" So at an order from the older boys we would all line up like peanuts about to cut and gather in crops. If the work was not going as quickly as the headmaster expected, the big boys, instead of giving us a helping hand, used to find it simpler to beat us with branches pulled from the trees. In order to avoid these blows , we used to bribe the older boys with the juicy cakes we used to bring for our midday meals. And if we happened to have any money on us, the coins changed hands at once. If we did not do this, if we were afraid of going home with an empty stomach or an empty purse, the blows were redoubled. They hit us so violently and with such evil enjoyment that even a deaf and dumb person would have realized that we were being whipped not so much to make us work harder, but rather to beat us into a state of obedience in which we would be only too glad to give up our food and money. Occasionally one of us, worn out by such calculated cruelty, would have the courage to complain to the headmaster. He would of course be very angry, but the punishment he gave the older boys was always very small--nothing compared to what they had done to us. And the fact is that however much we complained, our situation did not improve in the slightest. Perhaps we should have let our parents know what was going on, but somehow we never dreamed of doing so; I don't know whether it was loyalty or pride that kept us silent, but I can see now that we were foolish to keep quiet about it, for such beatings were completely foreign to our nature."

This text is mainly about _ .	"The words ""winner"" and ""loser"" have many meanings. When we refer to a person as a winner, we do not mean one makes someone else lose. To us , a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible ,trustworthy, responsive , and genuine, both as an individual and as a member of a society. Winners are not afraid to do their own thinking and to use their own knowledge! They can separate facts from opinons and don't pretend to have all the answers. They listen to others. evaluate what they say, but come to their own conclusion. Although winners can admire and respect other people, they are not totally defined, demolished, bound, or awed by them. Winners do not play ""helpness"", nor do they the blaming game. Instead, they assume responsibility for their own lives! They do not give others a false authority over them. Winners are their own bosses and know it. A winner's timing is right. Winners respond appropriately to the situation. Their responses are related to the message sent. They know the importance and the value of the people involved. Winners know that for every thing there is a season and for every activity a time. Although winners can freely enjoy themselves, they can also postpone enjoyment, can discipline themselves in the present to enhance their enjoyment in the future. Winners are not afraid to go after what they want, but they do so in appropriate ways. Winners do not get their security by controlling others. They do not set themselves up to lose. A winner cares about the world and its peoples. A winner is not _ from the general problems of society ,but is concerned, compassionate, and committed to improving the quality of life. Even in the face of national and international adversity, a winner's self-image is not one of a powerless individual. A winner works to make the world a better place."

What can be learned from the passage?	Driving in a foreign country is always different in at least some ways from driving in your own country. Here are some general points regarding driving in New Zealand. Visitors wishing to drive in New Zealand do not require an international driver's license but are required to carry their local driver's license whenever driving. Vehicles drive on the left-hand side of the road as they do in Britain, Australia, and Japan. Most rental vehicles will have a sticker reminding you of this important fact. When the traffic light is red, you must stop. There is no left turn rule as in North America. New Zealand road rules follow international standards but please note that in New Zealand vehicles turning left must give way to traffic turning right. In general, if you are turning left (where there are give-way signs or no signs), give way to vehicles that not turning. In all other situations, give way to vehicles crossing or coming from your right. Seat belts must be worn at all times while driving in New Zealand. This stands for the driver and passengers. The driver is responsible for ensuring all passengers are wearing their seatbelts. Do not drink alcohol before driving in New Zealand--drinking and driving laws are strictly enforced. Speed limits are in kilometres per hour (kph), not miles per hour (mph). Speed conversion: 1 kph equals 0.621 mph; 1 mph equals 1.61 kph. The speed limit on the open road is 100km/h. In towns and cities the speed limit is 50km/h. Be sure to obey all school crossing speed reductions as speed cameras operate regularly throughout New Zealand.

The writer mentions Easter at the beginning of the passage in order to _ .	Easter is still a great day for worship, randy in baskets and running around the yard finding eggs, but every year it gets quite a bit worse for bunnies. And no, not because the kids like to pull their ears. The _ is climate change, and some researchers found that rising temperatures arc having harmful effects on at least five species of rabbit in the US. Take the Lower Keys March rabbit, for instance. An endangered species that lives in the Lower Florida Keys, this species of cottontail is a great swimmer -- it lives on the islands! -- but it is already severely affected by development and now by rising levels. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, an ocean level rise of only 0. 6 meters will send these guys jumping to higher ground and a 0.9-meter rise would wipe out their habitat completely. The snowshoe hare, on the other hand, has a color issue. Most of these rabbits change their fur color from white in the wintertime to brown in the summer, each designed to give them better cover from predators . As the number of days with snow decreases all across the country, however, more and more bunnies arc being left in white fur during brown dirt days of both fall and spring, making them an easier mark for predators. Researchers know that the color change is controlled by the number of hours of sunlight, but whether the rabbit will be able to adapt quick enough to survive is a big question. The National Wildlife Federation has reported that hunters have noticed their numbers are already markedly down. American pikas or rock rabbits, a relative of rabbits and hares, might be the firs' of these species to go extinct due to climate change. About 7-8 inches long, pikas live high in the cool, damp mountains west of the Rocky Mountains. As global temperatures rise, they would naturally migrate to higher ground -- but they already occupy the mountaintops. They can't go any higher. The National Wildlife Federation reports that they might not be able to stand the new temperatures as their habitat beats up. The volcano rabbit has the same problem. These rabbits live on the slopes of volcanoes in Mexico, and recent studies have shown that the lower range of their habitat has already shifted upward about 700 meters, but there are not suitable plants for them to move higher, so they are stuck in the middle. Scientists are concerned about their populations. Native to the US, pygmy rabbits weigh less than 1 pound and live in the American West. They are believed to be the smallest rabbits in the world. Their habitats have been destroyed by development. Several populations, such as the Columbia Basin pygmy, almost went extinct and were saved by zoo breeding programs. Pygmy rabbits also rely on winter cover by digging tunnels through the snow to escape predators, but lesser snowfall is leaving them exposed. All of this gives new meaning to dressing up in a giant bunny costume this Easter.	['introduce the issue about bunnies']
What's the main idea of this passage?	"Many years ago, there was an old man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So he told them to go and look at a pear tree. It was far away from his home. The first son went in winter, the second in spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in autumn. When the sons came back, the old man asked them to say what they had seen. The first son complained the tree was ugly. The second son said the tree was covered with buds and full of hope. The third son said the tree was full of green leaves. They looked so beautiful, and it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen. The youngest son said that the tree was bowed down with heavy fruits. It was full of life and fulfillment . The man explained that all of his sons were right, but each of them had seen just one season of the tree. He told them that they couldn't judge a tree or a person by only one season. ""If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the hope of your spring, the beauty of your summer, and the fulfillment of your autumn."" said the old man. It is true that we shouldn't let the hard season break the happiness of the other seasons. Never give up during the difficult days and better times are sure to come some day."	"[""Don't judge a life by one difficult time.""]"
According to the passage, Bunyan hated the rich people mainly because _ .	"British writer John Bunyan was born at Elstow, Bedfordshire, England, in November, 1628. His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his ""Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners."" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. Like most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth ""by hook and by crook."" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation through spiritual struggle. Bunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. Bunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). The Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. ""The Vanity Fair,"" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed."	['the rich usually got their wealth in dishonest ways']

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Do you enjoy watching beautiful sunsets and seeing wildlife in some of the best parts of Wisconsin? Do you like being around people who share the same respect and love for natural resources? If you say""yes"", then a fisheries biologist is a great career choice for you. As you can probably guess, education is very important. A Bachelor of Science degree in fisheries or biology is strongly recommended . Many biologists have a Master's degree. But it's not only good education that prepares you for a career as a fisheries biologist--field experience is also important. Volunteer work, internships and short-term fish technician positions are good ways to gain valuable training that can give you an edge in the competitive job market. In addition to good education and field experience, a fisheries biologist needs other skills. You'll spend a lot of time working with the public, so it's important to feel comfortable talking to a variety of people. Good communication, listening, and presentation skills are a must. A common _ among many people is that fisheries biologists get to fish all the time. Most biologists wish that were true. But as a fisheries biologist, you are especially busy during the fishing season, which leaves little time for you to actually go fishing. It's sad, but true. Each day brings something different in the life of a fisheries biologist. In the spring and fall, you spend a lot of time on the water shocking fish in order to sample the population, studying fish, and talking with people. The winter is spent analyzing fish data and communication with the public. So if you find fish interesting and fun to learn about, and like working both outside and inside, consider a career as a fisheries biologist. You'll never be bored!"

At present people are letting elephants do some _ work.	Can we make animals work for us? Some scientists think that one day we can teach animals to do a lot of things for people. They say that in a film or on TV you may see elephants, monkeys, dogs or some other animals doing a lot of things. If you watch carefully, you may find those animals are always given a little food to eat after they have done something. Scientists say that people can teach many different animals to do some easy work if they know they will get something to eat. We all know elephants can carry large logs and dogs can look after houses. And we can even teach animals to work in factories. In America, for example, people use apes to help make cars. Scientists think that those big monkeys may, one day, drive trains. Now people are trying to let them do something just like man.	['heavy']
From the text we know _ .	Bamboo is one of the nature's most surprising plants. Many people call this plant a tree, but it is a kind of grass. Like other kinds of grass, a bamboo plant may be cut very low to the ground, but it will grow back very quickly. A Japanese scientist recorded one bamboo plant that grew almost 1.5 meters in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe. There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains. Not all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide _ . This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green. Many Asian countries have been using bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for building new buildings. As a matter of fact, the cables that hold up the hanging bridge across the Min River in Sichuan are made of bamboo. The bridge has been in use for more than 1,000 years, and is still holding strong. In Africa, engineers are teaching poor farmers how to find water using bamboo. These African countries need cheap ways to find water because they have no money, and their fields often die from no rain and no water. It seems that bamboo is one of the best things they can use. Bamboo pipes and drills can help to make the poor thirsty fields to be watered.	['a bamboo plant may grow 4.5 meters in three days']
What kind of person could the farmer Fleming probably be?	"His name was Fleming, and he was a poor Scottish farmer. One day, while trying to eke out a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming from a nearby bog . He dropped his tools and ran to the bog. There, mired to his waist in black muck was a terrified boy, screaming and struggling to free himself. Farmer Fleming saved the lad from what could have been a slow and terrifying death. The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman's sparse surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved. ""I want to repay you,"" said the nobleman. ""You saved my son's life."" ""No, "" the Scottish farmer replied, waving off the offer. At that moment, the farmer's own son came to the door of the family hovel . ""Is that your son?"" the nobleman asked. ""Yes,"" the farmer replied proudly. ""I'll make you a deal. Let me take him and give him a good education. If the lad is anything like his father, he'll grow to a man you can be proud of."" And that he did. In time, Farmer Fleming's son graduated from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, and went on to become known throughout the world as the noted Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of Penicillin. Years afterward, the nobleman's son was stricken with pneumonia . What saved him? Penicillin. The name of the nobleman? Lord Randolph Churchill. His son's name? Sir Winston Churchill."

What is mainly discussed in this text?	Living in the desert is really hard! With less than 10 inches of rainfall a year, deserts are dry all year round. Lots of heat from the sun and a shortage of water are just a few of the challenges facing desert animals. Deserts are homes to many animals and plants. Few large animals have got used to life in the desert because their size makes it difficult to find shelter from the heat and they can't store water. In order to survive, desert animals have developed a number of ways to live in their special habitat. The most common way is staying under plants or rocks or digging underground in the heat of the day. And many desert animals stay in shelter during the day and hunt at night when it is cool. Some animals get the water they need from the insects, plants and seeds they eat, and do not need to drink. They do not have sweat glands and pass only small amount of waste water. Some animals develop their own ways of surviving in deserts. The Thorny Devil is a kind of lizard that lives in Australian desert areas. It has a body that channels raindrops directly into its mouth when it rains. Water-holding frogs spend most of the year underground in Australian desert areas, and develop a sort of cocoon that enables them to store water to keep them going through the dry times. When it rains, they come out to lay their eggs in ponds. The eggs hatch within days and develop quickly, before the water dries out.	['How desert animals survive in deserts.']
As men became more civilized they _ .	In the earliest stages of man's development he had no more need of money than animals have. He was content with very simple forms of shelter, made his own rough tools and weapons and could provide food and clothing for himself and his family from natural materials around him. As he became more civilized, however, he began to want better shelter, more efficient tools and weapons, and more comfortable and more lasting clothing than could be provided by his own neighborhood or by the work of his own unskilled hands. For these things he had to turn to the skilled people such as smiths, leather workers or carpenters. It was then that the question of payment arose. At first he got what he wanted by a simple process of exchange. The smith who had not the time to look after land or cattle was glad to take meat or grain from the farmer in exchange for an axe or a plough . But as more and more goods which had no fixed exchange value came on the market, exchange became too complicated to be satisfactory. Another problem arose when those who made things wanted to get stocks of wood or leather, or iron, but had nothing to offer in exchange until their finished goods were ready. Thus the difficulties of exchange led by degree to the invention of money. In some countries easily handled things like seeds or shells were given a certain value and farmer, instead of paying the smith for a new axe by giving him some meat or grain, gave him so many shells. If the smith had any shells left when he had bought his food, he could get stocks of the raw materials of his trade. In some countries quite large things such as cows or camels or even big flat stones were used for trade. Later, pieces of metal, bearing values according to the rarity of the metal and the size of the pieces, or coins were used. Money as we know it had arrived.

The passage mainly intends to tell us that_.	"My grandfather had a small farm where he raised beef and some grain for feed. He also worked diligently as a factory laborer and country pastor. He was a good neighbor and well-respected for honoring his word. When harvest time came, he'd piece together his old one-row corn picker and oil it up for the season. All his life he worked hard, helped others, and you could count on him to keep his promises. He had promised to harvest a few ribbons of corn on a friend's farm, but after harvesting his own corn, Grandpa's little corn picker coughed and quit. It would be out of commission until a particular part could be ordered, but that would take far too long to help this year. The factory where Grandpa worked began to require overtime. In order to keep his job there he had to leave the farm before dawn and get home until well after sunset. One autumn night, while harvest time was running out, he and his wife sat at the kitchen table and trying to figure a way out of their dilemma. ""There's nothing you can do,"" said my grandma. ""You'll just have to tell him that you can't help with the corn this year."" ""Well that just doesn't sit well with me,"" said my grandpa. ""My friend is depending on me. I can't exactly let my neighbor's harvest rot in the field, can I?"" ""When do you think you'd have time to do it?"" she asked. ""With the overtime you've been working you'd be up all night."" ""I know of one night that I could do it!"" he said, running to the bookshelf. He grabbed the Farmer's Almanac and started flipping through the pages. ""Aha! There's still one more full moon in October."" They say it's called the harvest moon because it gives farmers more light and more time to collect their crops. And so a few days later, after a long shift at the factory, my grandpa made his way to the field where my grandma met him in the truck with dinner. The weather was cold but clear, and the moon was brilliant. He worked through the night to keep his word. I know this story well, so sometimes, when I'm tempted to cut corners or to put off responsibilities, I think of my grandfather with his scythe cutting wide arcs of corn in the light of the harvest moon."

The wife did so much for her husband that morning probably because _ .	"A man wakes up with a big hangover the morning after attending his company's annual Summer Party. He can't even remember how he got home from the party, let alone how he got so drunk and is deathly afraid of what he may have done or said the night before to make his wife angry. The man forces his eyes open and the first things he sees are two headache tablets next to a glass of water on his table, and, next to them, a single red rose! He sits up with difficulty and sees his clothing hung on the back of his chair all clean and pressed and the rest of the house all in perfect order. Incredulous , the man takes the tablets and sees a black eye looking back at him from the bathroom mirror. Then he finds a note next to the red rose on the table, ""Sweetie, breakfast is waiting for you on the stove. I left early to buy the cooking materials to make your favorite dinner tonight. I love you, darling! "" The note was signed, ""Your loving wife."" The man then walks into the kitchen. His daughter Jessie is at the table, eating. ""Jessie...what happened last night?"" The man asks, with great fear. ""Well, you came home around four o'clock in the morning, drunk and out of your mind. You tripped and fell onto the coffee table and broke it, and got this black eye when you crashed into the table's edge."" Puzzled, the man asks Jessie, ""Then why is there a rose on my table and breakfast on the stove waiting for me?"" ""Oh that,"" Jessie replies, ""well, Mom pulled you into your bedroom, and when she tried to undress you, you yelled, 'Leave me alone; I'm married and I love my wife!'"""

To be an effective listener, you'd better _	"Do you notice that though students spend the same amount of time in class, some get better grades than others? In some ways, it's because they are different listeners. When having classes, some of them listen carefully. We call them _ listeners. Some just daydream or talk to others. They are ineffective listeners. How are some listeners effective? First of all, they don't care about some poor situations, like an uncomfortable seat or a personal problem. They say ""No"" to anything that will stop them from understanding and remembering. After leaving a class or meeting, they remember what the speakers said, not the room conditions or the speaker's accent . Effective listeners always pay attention to the message itself. They try not to be influenced by their own feelings or opinions. They do not decide if the thing is boring, too easy, or too difficult before listening. They like getting the challenge of new ideas. To help remember difficult ideas, they write down important words and phrases. However, ineffective listeners often daydream. They don't like to hear what they don't agree with or easily understand. They are often so busy taking notes that they miss the speaker's main idea. These listeners leave a speech or a class with a notebook full of words, but the notebook means nothing. Do you wish to do well in your study? Start to be an effective listener. It may help."	['pay attention to the message itself']
"Why does the president mention more goods and services ""Made in America""?"	"Hi, everybody. Over the past couple months, most of the political headlines you've read have probably been about the government shutdown and the launch of the Affordable Care Act . And I know that many of you have rightly never been more frustrated with Washington. But if you look beyond those headlines, there are some good things happening in our economy. And that's been my top priority since the day I walked into the Oval Office. After decades in which the middle class was working harder and harder just to keep up, and a punishing recession that made it worse, we made the tough choices required not just to recover from crisis, but to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. Five years later, we have fought our way back. Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months. Another 200,000 Americans went back to work last month. The American auto industry has come back with more than 350,000 new jobs --- jobs putting out and selling the high-tech, fuel-efficient cars the world wants to buy. And they're leading the charge in a business that has added jobs for the first time since the 1990s --- a big reason why our businesses sell more goods and services ""Made in America"" than ever before. We decided to stop our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we produce more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries. We decided to fix a broken health care system. And even though the task has been rough, so far, about 500,000 Americans gain health coverage starting January 1st. And by the way, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. And one more thing: since I took office, we've cut our deficits by more than half. And that makes it easier to invest in the things that create jobs --- education, research, and so on. Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together. Think about what we could do if the few didn't hold the economy hostage every few months, or waste time on dozens of votes to _ the Affordable Care Act rather than try to help us fix it. In the weeks ahead, I'll keep talking about my plan to build a better bargain for the middle class. Good jobs. A good education. A chance to buy a home, save, and retire. And yes, the financial security of affordable health care. And I'll look for any willing partners who want to help. Because of your hard work and tough sacrifices over the past five years, we're pointed in the right direction. But we've got more work to do to keep moving that way. And as long as I'm President, I'll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead. Thanks, and have a great weekend."	['To show that the employment rate has been increased.']
The ozone layer exists to _ .	"The ozone layer is a thin layer of gas around the earth. It forms a special ""blanket"" around the planet. This ""blanket"" protects the earth from dangerous rays produced by the sun. Without the ozone layer, the earth's climate could warm to dangerous levels. This increase in temperature would threaten our survival. Scientists recently have discovered a hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctica. Now there is great concern that this warning has started, endangering all life on the earth. What has destroyed part of the ozone layer? Scientists do not know for sure. They suspect that our popular spray cans have played a part in the damage. Many spray cans contain dangerous gases. These gases might have destroyed the ozone layer fifteen miles above the earth's surface, The chemicals used in refrigerators and air conditioners may contribute to the problem, too. Many scientists believe that the destruction of the ozone layer is a serious problem for people everywhere. Global warming could change weather patterns around the world. Farmers and ranchers could find it more and more difficult to produce enough food for the earth's people. If more of the sun's dangerous rays reached the earth, there also could be an increase in skin cancers. Some skin cancers might cause people to die. Although some scientists do not believe there is a serious danger, obviously no one wants to take any chance on such a possibility. Can scientists repair the hole in the ozone layer? They really don't know the answer to that question. Can people do anything to save the ozone layer that the earth still has? Scientists stress the need to limit the use of spray cans and other items that contain the dangerous gases. This will not be an easy task. People all over the world use these items. Solving the problem certainly will require commitment and cooperation from everyone."	['protect the earth from dangerous sun rays']
What got in the way of developing health insurance and pensions in Africa?	"A new report says African governments are ill prepared to handle the growing number of people over age 65. The population in Africa as in other parts of the world, is getting older. Currently, there are 36 million people on the continent 65 years and above. which is 3.6 percent of the population. up from 3.3 percent 10 years ago. That could rise to 4.5 percent by 2030 and 10 percent by 2050. The African development Bank is raising concerns over the shortage of health insurance and pensions . The African Development Bank says. ""Aging is highly linked with long-term physical and mental disability and a number of long-term chronic conditions."" ""Africa is not well prepared to care for its aging population right now. And it needs to prepare for this fact."" said Professor Mthuli Ncube. the African Development Bank's chief economist. African nations spend far less on healthcare than developed nations do _ about $26per person per year. Not so many countries have well developed medical aid plans for the elderly, whether they are privately provided plans or indeed government plans. If you look at the pension plans, you will find the pension industries are not well developed in some of the countries. Professor Mthuli Ncube said African governments failed to take action on health insurance and pensions because they were busy with economic reforms. Another challenge for Africa is the worsening of informal systems of social protection. That is cash and support from both the extended family and community sources. . The African Development Bank recommends governments help carry out health insurance and pension plans. Ncube said African governments didn't have to handle the health insurance burden alone. ""It is not only a must but also an opportunity for private companies to add their bit in this regard"", he said. The report also recommends that African governments consider providing ways of free health services. medications and long-term health care facilities for the elderly."	['The economic reforms.']
Who called the fire brigade and ambulance service?	"It was 3:12 a.m. when nine-year-old Glenn Kreamer awoke to the smell of burning. Except for the crackling of flames somewhere below there was not a sound in the two-storey house at Baldwin, Long Island. With his father away on night duty at a local factory, Glenn was worried about the safety of his mother, his sister Karen, 14 and his 12-year-old brother Todd. He ran downstairs through the smoke-filled house to push and pull at Karen and Todd until they sat up. Then he helped each one through the house to the safety of the garden. There, his sister and brother, taking short and quick breaths and coughing, collapsed on the lawn. The nine-year-old raced back into the house and upstairs to his mother's room. He found it impossible to wake her up. Mrs. Kreamer, a victim of the smoke, was unconscious, and there was nobody to help Glenn carry her to the garden. But the boy remained calm and , as a fireman said later, ""acted with all the self-control of a trained adult."" On the bedroom telephone, luckily still working, Glenn called his father and, leaving Mr. Kreamer to telephone the fire brigade and ambulance service, got on with the task of saving his mother. First he filled a bucket with water from the bathroom and threw water over his mother and her bed. Then, with a wet cloth around his head he went back to the garden. He could hear the fire engine coming up, but how would the firemen find his mother in the smoke-filled house where flames had almost swallowed up the ground floor? Grasping firmly a ball of string from the garage, Glenn raced back into the house and dashed upstairs to his mother's room. Tying one end of the string to her hand, he ran back, laying out the string as he went, through the hall and back out into the garden. Minutes later he was telling fire chief John Coughlan: ""The string will lead you to my mother."" Mrs. Kreamer was carried to safety as the flames were breaking through her bedroom floor."

According to the text, Julianna _ .	"Julianna Huth, a second grader at Green Primary School, in Green, Ohio, is a fan of the digital world. The 8-year-old enjoys e-books at home and at school. ""It's just cool that you can read on your IPad,"" said Julianna, who started using e-books when she was 6. ""It's more fun and you learn more from it."" Children would say that books on e-readers are fun. They include music, cartoons and other interactive functions that make reading a book feel like playing a video game. But is it better than a book? Julianna's teacher, Kourtney Denning, thinks highly of e-books. ""Traditional books aren't good enough anymore,"" she said. ""We have to transform our learning as we know it."" Julianna's mother, Cathy Ivancic, said that electronic devices like the IPad were new and fun and gave children the motivation to read, including those who didn't like reading. Some people, however, are suggesting a closer look, especially for younger children learning to read. ""Read traditional books with your child. We don't have any evidence that any kind of electronic device is better than a parent,"" said Julia Parish-Morris, who has studied e-books and how children interact with them. Ms. Parish-Morris and educators are concerned that children can be distracted by the cartoons and gamelike features within e-books. Keeping a focus on the story is important in developing reading and writing skills. ""The most important thing is sitting and talking with your children,"" said Gabrille Strouse, a professor who has studied e-books. ""Whether you're reading a book or an e-book, co-interacting, co-viewing is the best way for them to learn."" Lisa Guernsey, director of the early education initiative at the New America Foundation, says conversations about how events of a story relate to(......) the child's own life, or asking open-ended questions about what happened, are examples of natural dialogue. But this kind of interaction is often different with e-books , she said, and in some cases, disappears. ""We are seeing some evidence that parents expect the e-books to do it all and are stepping back from communicating with their children,"" she said."	['is crazy about reading e-books']
Which of the following words can be used to describe the China Pavilion?	"World Expo 2010 Shanghai China is to be staged in Shanghai from May 1 to October 31, 2010. If you plan to visit the Shanghai Expo this summer, China Pavilion is a must - see area for you. China Pavilion, which is called Oriental Crown, is located at the center of the Expo site. Standing 63 meters tall, the China Pavilion takes the shape of an emperor's crown, with the upper layers larger than the lower ones. Covering 160,000 square meters in floor space, the pavilion is made up of a national hall and a regional( ) hall. Buildings on the China Pavilion began on Dec. 18, 2007. The design of the China Pavilion was picked from a total of 344 designs put forward by Chinese from around the world. The pavilion has both traditional and modern features, which helps develop the theme of the 2010 Expo; ""Better City, Better Life. For example, it is red in appearance, which covers the traditional Chinese culture, and it is green indoors, with the use of energy - saving techniques. The Shanghai World Expo is expected to attract 70 million visitors from across the globe. It is estimated that 400,000 people will visit the Expo and its 140 pavilions every day during the period, but the China Pavilion is only able to receive about one tenth of the total. How to hold so many people in the pavilion remains a tough task. Luckily, the China Pavilion is built as a permanent landmark. During the Expo, the main structure( ) will be used for an exhibition based on the theme of "" Chinese wisdom in urban development"" by explaining the values of harmony( ), nature and spirit. The three - story pavilion has three sections. The top floor's ""Footprint of the East"" will show some of the changes in Chinese cities. There, you can see a film which shows how Chinese cities have changed, especially in the past 30 years. According to Lu Chuan, director of the film, the scenery is like something from Lord of the Rings. On the second floor, ""Journey of Wisdom"" will explain China's four great inventions. And the ground's "" Blossoming"" City will display scenes from cities of the future."	['Environment - friendly.']
From the text we can infer that the boy _ .	"A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his 5-year-old son waiting for him at the door. ""Daddy, may I ask you a question?"" ""Yeah sure, what is it?"" replied the man. ""Daddy, how much do you make an hour?"" ""That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?"" the man said angrily. ""I just want to know. Please tell me. How much do you make an hour?"" pleaded the little boy. ""If you must know, I make $20 an hour."" ""Oh,"" the little boy replied, with his head down. Looking up, he said, ""Daddy, may I please borrow $10?"" The father was furious, ""If the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you are being so selfish. I don't work hard every day for such childish behavior."" The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door. The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money? About an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think: maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that $10 and he really didn't ask for money very often. The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door. ""Are you asleep, son?"" He asked. ""No daddy, I'm awake,"" replied the boy. ""I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier,"" said the man. ""It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the $10 you asked for."" The little boy sat straight up, smiling. ""Oh, thank you, daddy!"" he yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills. The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The little boy counted out his money, then looked up at his father. ""Why do you want more money if you already have some?"" the father grumbled. ""Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,"" the little boy replied. ""Daddy, I have $20 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you."""	['loved his father very much']
The cast of Robots is made up of all the following actors or actresses EXCEPT _ .	"Here's a movie-a sharp, sugar-rush of fun that's guaranteed to entertain the entire family. With some terrific computer-generated effects, a great cast and a fun-packed storyline, Robots is the best animated film since The Incredibles. Yep, it really is that good. Set in a world populated by robots, Ewan McGregor plays Rodney Copperbottom, a young robot who leaves his small-town home to pursue his dream of becoming an inventor. But after arriving in Robot City, his hopes of getting a job at Bigweld Industries are destroyed when he learns the firm has been taken over by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Egged on by his controlling mum, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), Ratchet plans to reduce half on Robot City's citizens to scrap metal by refusing to sell the spare Pans they need to survive. Instead, he wants to make a fortune selling expensive upgrades that few can afford. As he says, ""Why be you when you can be new?"" Aided by a few misfit robots known as the Rustles-including Robin Williams as the cowardly Fender (""I'm made of a metal called Afraidium"")-Rodney must track down the firm's founder, Bigweld (Mel Brooks), and convince him to save the city from Ratchet's plans. The first thing that'll strike you about the movie is the thought that's gone into creating Robot City. It's a wondrous world full of mechanical marvels including wind-up cars and walking streetlamps. Also terrific are the special effects. This might be animated movie but at times you'll catch yourself thinking it's really a live-action film. Of course, there have been plenty of animated movies that looked the part but were let down by a weak storyline(see Shark Tale, for example). But Robots grips right from the start thanks to a heart-warming and thoroughly engaging plot that never bores. My only complaints are with Williams who, as usual, has a one-in-10 success rate with his jokes. Also a letdown is a romantic subplot between Rodney and a shapely robot called Cappy (Halle Berry) that doesn't go anywhere. Complains aside, this is a mechanical marvel that'll have you bolted firmly to your seat. BEST QUOTE :Fender:""Even though you had a discouraging day, just remember there's another one coming tomorrow. BEST BIT:Check out those amazing images. WORST BIT:Robin Williams' character does an unfunny Britney Spears dance routine. IF YOU LIKED...Ice Age, The Incredibles, Toy Story...YOU'LL LIKE THIS."	['Britney Spears']
What can we learn from the text?	"Let's say you took violin lessons all through elementary school, but you haven't got the instrument out of its case for years. Were all those lessons a waste of your parents' money because you didn't become a violinist? Even though it has been a long time since you played the violin, a new study shows that as little as one year of music training can have a positive impact on your brain that will last the rest of your life. In an experiment, researchers compared children who had taken music lessons to those who hadn't. Laurel Trainor, who studies music and the mind, discovered that the musically-trained children had better brain responses in certain sound recognition exams. Trainor's findings show the possibility that musical education can actually improve the brain's hearing cortex . ""The study's results show that music training affects attention and memory, and helps children develop learning skills. In this way music training might lead to better learning across a number of fields,"" Trainor said in a statement. The effects of music education are even more obvious on children with difficulty in reading and writing and other language-related disabilities. So, whether you can play a good piece of music or not, it's likely that your years of music lessons have prepared your brain for all the speeches, emails, and adult conversations that are part of your life today. We should help make sure that children today have the same opportunities for music, and help out by volunteering with or donating instruments to your school's music education department."

Nowadays, before buying something, people usually _ .	It's a natural phenomenon. The minute you think you want to buy something new, you go online to read reviews about it. Not only is this done with shopping, it's also done for movies to see , restaurants to go to and almost everything that is worth having an opinion on. The concept of writing down a review for all to see is something that has caused the birth of reviews sites. These are sites where people post reviews on other people, services, businesses, products and more. In some cases you have professionals do the review and in some other cases you will have the average person write it up. Review sites have a number of ways in which they can gain _ for themselves in the form of advertising. In some cases, a business can pay his way through to a better listing spot. This does not mean that a positive review will be promoted where it is not warranted . Review sites are largely a public forum and it is not necessary for people to reveal their identity. Since people are anonymous and sign up access is open to all, there are chances that reviews will be planted or will be negatively written simply to discredit a particular product or service. There is a lot of criticism towards these websites since they do nothing to control the kind of entries made or the source of these entries. On the other hand, there are professional review sites. These people are accountable for each of their reviews. Any doubts you have will be addressed personally by the one writing the review.

The example of a woman talking on the phone in the car supports the idea that _	"Cell Phone Are the New Cigarette When you get in your car, you reach for it. When you are at work, you take a break to have a moment alone with it. When you get in to a lift, you play with it. Cigarette? Cup of coffee? No, it's the third most addictive thing in modern life, the cell phone. Experts say that it is becoming more difficult for many people to curb their longing to hug it more tightly than most of their personal relationships. With its shiny surface and its smooth and satisfying touch, the cell phone connects us to the world even as it disconnects us from people three feet away. In just the past couple of years, the cell phone has challenged people in ways its inventors in the late 1940s never imagined. The costs are becoming even more obvious, and I don't mean just the monthly bill. Dr. Chris Knippers, working at the Betty Ford Center in Southern California, reports that the overuse of cell phones has become a social problem not much different from other harmful addictions: a problem that limits one-on-one personal contact, and an escape from reality. Sounds extreme, but we've all witnessed the evidence: the person at restaurant who talks on the phone through an entire meal, ignoring his kids around the table; the women who talks on the phone in the car, ignoring her husband; the teen who texts messages all the way home from school, avoiding contact with kids all around him. Is it just rude, or is it a kind of unhealthiness? And pardon me, but how is this improving the quality of life? Jim Williams, an industrial sociologist based in Massachusetts, notes that cell-phone addiction is part of a set of symptoms in a widening gulf of personal separation. He points to a study by Duke University researchers that found one-quarter of Americans say they have no one to discuss their most important personal business with,Williams says studies show that we don't have as many friends as our parents.""Just as more information has led to less wisdom,more acquaintances via the Internet and cell phones have produced fewer friends.""he says."

Before the author started adapting to the belief of the reverse paranoia,he used to _ .	"""Success begins with belief and ends with doubt.""--Larina Kase I remember reading through a book and the author was writing about being a reverse paranoid. In that particular section he mentions how he has a belief that the world he's living in is out to give him everything he absolutely wants and desires. There are times when I think to myself,""Wow,the world is out to get me and make me miserable."" Then I thought,why can't I believe that the world is out to make me a better conversationalist. Then I started adapting to the belief of the reverse paranoia. When I started talking to people,I truly believed that I was the most interesting person in the room. I believed that everything I said added value to the conversation. I believed that people stayed behind and chatted with me because they found me _ . As a matter of fact, for about five months I wrote down on my bathroom mirror the following affirmation:""People love me and respect me. It is a privilege to talk to me. People find me interesting and charming and always want to get to know me better!"" I would say the affirmation after I brushed my teeth. And I would continue to say it until I felt completely great about myself. There were days that I just wouldn't feel like saying it,because it would feel like a lie to me. But that's the trouble,like the quote says,success ends when there's doubt. And that's why I continued until I had no doubt in my mind. Then strange things happened,I noticed that people did find me more interesting,and that I gained more confidence in talking with people. I was more assertive at work. I was able to control politics and gossip at work to minimal levels,and became a much better manager,and developed better customer relations to the point that sales were up by 20% compared to the year before,on my best month sales were up by 39%,and this was a year that a recession was happening."

The author decided to take the subway because _ .	After I made it to the city center, I started to feel it might be easy for a foreigner to deal with the great size of Beijing. With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along. After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand. In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me. All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip. This experience made it clear I had to learn some Chinese quickly or my adventures might start turning into bad luck.	['he believed in his ability to deal with the trip']
Which of the following can be the best title for the text?	"The triathlon promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports. Recently it has drawn huge crowds attracted by athletes swimming 1,500m, cycling 40km, and then running 10km, without stopping. But what makes an attractive 17-year-old give up everything for the doubtful pleasures it offers? Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those often-repeated phrases about personal satisfaction, mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim for 1,500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. When the40kmcycle ride is over, you haveto run10km, which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted. But it's great fun, and all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and she won the junior section. Full of confidence, she entered the National Championships, and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she came nowhere. ""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea. We realized then that we had gone wrong. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the running."" But she didn't give up. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would be tempted to do it again."" Such _ draws admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th.""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to talk her long-suffering parents, who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's world championships, into buying a PS2,000 bike, so she can try25kmand100kmraces later this year. But there is another price to pay. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""After two hours' hard swimming on Friday night, I just want to go to sleep. But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, what sort of times they are achieving."""	"[""The Triathlon's Great Attraction""]"
In what tone did Frank tell of his father?	Frank looked at us and said, ''My Dad was a fisherman. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. No matter how much my Mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish.'' His voice dropped a bit. ''When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had an old truck which was older than he was. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he drove toward the school, I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here, I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye!'' He paused and then went on, ''I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, 'No, Dad. I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss.'' ''My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. I had never seen him cry. He turned and looked out the windshield . 'You're right,' he said. 'You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore.'' Frank got a funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke. ''It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed. They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have gotten into a gale and was trying to save the nets and the floats.''	['Regretful.']
What will happen to students praised for being smart in face of choosing tasks compared to students praised for working hard?	"We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them, but we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make mistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't. Experiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were praised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward usually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than being smart-far more often selected the more difficult task. If we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in order to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to make mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being perfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went wrong and how to get better. We don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us that if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the underlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes need to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned. As Thomas Edison said, ""I am not discouraged, because every abandoned wrong attempt is another step forward. "" Furthermore, we often make mistakes because we try new things-we wander away from accepted paths. Teflon, penicillin-these are examples of great discoveries made by mistake. Take a page from Albert Einstein, who said, ""Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. """	['He will choose a less challenging task.']
Which is the best title for the passage?	"Samantha, or Sam, as her husband, John, called her, had left the doctor's house looking perfect, satisfied with her appearance. The year was 1862. It seemed that the war with the North would never come to an end. Sam's father had left as soon as possible, swearing that he'd fight for Virginia, for their land, for their new government, for God, for the South. At last, Samantha reached the house that she and John owned. It was a cold, rainy night, and she was glad to be home. She stepped into the sitting room. John rested in an armchair, reading a book. He glanced at her, put the book down, and stood, reaching his arms out for her. They kissed briefly. He put a hand to her now slightly round belly and asked, ""What did the doctor say?"" ""He said the baby was fine and that I seemed healthy. Do you have any news?"" ""Surprisingly, yes."" John hesitated for a moment, as if deciding how he would phrase what he was about to say, and then unwillingly continued, ""I've been demanded to join the army."" Sam screamed, ""What?"" She was near tears. ""But-but we're just starting out."" Her voice shook. ""I thought that after two years of begging my mother to let the two of us get married that our life would finally be happy. Isn't there any way you can get out of this?"" John answered, ""I'm afraid not."" ""Please. Please, John, if you love me, please get out of this. Break a leg, fake an illness, do something."" She began to sob. John comforted her, resting her head on his shoulder. ""Sam."" ""What?"" ""Name the child after me; name it John or Joanna. I'll come back as soon as I can. I promise."" Sam smiled into his collar bone, knowing that John lived by his word. He never broke a promise. She pressed her hand to her belly, and, unknown to her, the baby was a girl. And unknown to both of them, the promise that John had just made would be the only promise he would ever break."	['The Broken Promise']
Margaret gets angry with people who work in the office because _ .	"Margaret, married with two small children, has been working for the last seven years as a night cleaner, cleaning offices in a big building. She trained as a nurse, but had to give it up when her elder child became seriously ill. ""I would have liked to go back to it, but theshifts are all wrong for me, as I have to be home to get the children up and off to school."" So she works as a cleaner instead, from 9 p.m. till 6 a.m. five nights a week for just PS90, before tax and insurance. ""It's better than it was last year, but I still think that people who work 'unsocial hours' should get a bit extra."" The hours she's chosen to work meant that she sees plenty of the children, but very little of her husband. However, she doesn't think that puts any pressure on their relationship. Her work isn't physically very hard, but it's not exactly pleasant, either. ""I do get angry with people who leave their offices like a place for raising pigs. If they realized people like me have to do it, perhaps they'd be a bit more careful."" The fact that she's working all night doesn't worry Margaret at all. Unlike some dark buildings at night, the building where she works is fully lit, and the women work in groups of three. ""Since I've got to be here, I try to enjoy myself----and I usually do, because of the other girls. We all have a good laugh, so the time never drags."" Another challenge Margaret has to face is the reaction of other people when she tells them what she does for a living. ""They think you're a cleaner because you don't know how to read and write,"" said Margaret. ""I used to think _ but I don't think that way any more. I don't dislike the work though I can't say I'm mad about it."""	['they always make a mess in their offices']
Doctors tell us _ .	"Running is becoming popular these days. Many of us run for health. Doctors say many health problems come from these bad habits: eating and drinking too much, smoking and not taking enough exercise. Doctors tell us. ""Eat and drink less, don't smoke, and exercise more."" Running is a good way of exercise because it helps to build a strong heart. It also helps most people lose weight.

The passage suggests the following things except _ .	We often don' t give importance to minor things thinking they won' t matter. But at times, some things look very minor but their result can be really powerful. Here are some of the efforts which can change the relationship between parents and children. Pat your child when he loses:May it be failure in the class, or on the field, speak words of encouragement to your child. The trust and confidence in your relationship will go to another level. After all, words of encouragement during failure are more valuable than words of praise after success. Give him importance, like a member of the family:Hang his painting in your room or in the office, take his opinion when you are buying furniture for the house. Your child will believe in himself and be a winner throughout. Share your own experience when your child makes a mistake:When you see your child lying or stealing, share with him the mistakes you made in your life. He' 11 know it is all right to make mistakes and that he can share with you anything. Appreciate at least one quality in your child every day:Each day look at what qualities your child possesses and appreciate him, maybe for his caring attitude, his dance skills or his observation power. Tell him how proud you are of him because of those qualities. Become his age before bedtime:Jump on the bed, have pillow fights, act silly, dance--become a child with your child for sometime. You' 11 forget all your day's stress. Try these minor things; you' 11 see the love deepen and the relationship blossom.	['painting your room or office']
"""Ad astra per aspera"" is used in the passage _ ."	"When the famous dancer Fred was interviewed for a job by a Hollywood producer , the movie Expert turned him down, saying,""Can't sing. Can't act. Dances a little."" Here's another stupid mistake. When the great scientist Albert Einstein was at school, his teachers considered him rather dull. And a final story, the famous Polish pianist Paderewski was told by a teacher that he'd never be a success as a performer because the middle finger on each hand was too short. What lessons can be drawn from these three experiences? First, true genius cann't be suppressed .For some reason or other it works its way out. Second, early judgments of a person's abilities may be unfair or just wrong. Third, when there is a real determination to succeed, obstacles fall by the wayside. The famous motto ""ad astra per aspera"" can be translated as "" To the stars through hardships"". Astaire, Einstein and Paderewski proved their critics wrong."	"[""As a motto for the three men's lives""]"

Though he is the oldest teacher of our school. he is very strong. All the students like him very much. During his class, no one sleeps. After class, he often tells jokes to us or does sports with us. Mr Brown likes music very much. We learn a lot of English songs from him. He is also fond of sports. He takes exercises at least three times a week. He is good at swimming, so you know why he looks so strong.	['Full of fun.']

According to this passage we know that _ .	All over the world people enjoy sports. Sports help to keep people healthy, happy and help them to live longer. Sports change with the season. People play different games in winter and summer. Games and sports often grow out of people's work and everyday activities. The Arabs use horses or camels in much of their everyday life; they use them in their sports, too. Some sports are so interesting that people everywhere go in for them. Football, for example, has spread around the world. Swimming is popular in all countries near the sea or in those with many rivers. Some sports or games go back thousands of years, like running or jumping. Chinese boxing, for example, has a very long history. But basketball and volleyball are rather new. Neither one is a hundred years old yet. People are inventing new sports or games all the time. People from different countries may not be able to understand each other, but after a game they often become good friends. Sports help to train a person's character . One learns to fight hard but fight fair, to win without pride and to lose with grace .	['not all the games have long history']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	The Bronte sisters were three sisters who became famous novelists. Their lives and works are connected with the lonely moors of Yorkshire, England, where they lived. Patrick Bronte, the sisters' father, was a poor Irishman who became the parish clergyman of the small, isolated town of Haworth, Yorkshire. Bronte was somewhat strange and tended to be strict. His wife died in 1821 and her sister brought up the family out of duty, but with little love or understanding. The sisters went to several boarding schools where they received a better education than usual for girls at that time, but in a bad atmosphere. Few jobs were available for women at that time, and the Bronte sisters, except for occasional jobs as governesses or schoolteachers, lived their entire lives at home. They were shy, poor, and lonely, and occupied themselves with music, drawing, reading and ---above all---writing. Their isolation led to the early development of their imaginations. In 1846, under the male pen names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, the sisters published a joint volume of poems.Although only two copies were sold, all three sisters soon had their first novels published. Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel Jane Eyre (1847) is largely _ . Through the heroine, Charlotte relived her hated boarding school life and her experiences as a governess in a large house. Rochester, the hero and master of the house, is fictional. Jane Eyre was enormously successful, but many readers were shocked that Rochester, who tried to make Jane his mistress, should be rewarded by marrying her. Some readers were also shocked because Jane wanted to be regarded as a thinking and independent person, rather than as a weak female. Charlotte Bronte wrote three other novels. The first one, The Professor, was not published until 1857, after her death. Shirley (1849) is set among the labour riots of the early 1800s. Villette (1853) the most popular of the three, is based on Charlotte's unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels.	['writing was not intended for women in the 19th century in Britain']
It can be inferred from the passage that the writer _ .	"It doesn't matter if you have one friend or 20, because there are only a few people in this world that can make you truly happy. For me, my family and my three best girlfriends mean everything to me. Some days I didn't want to go to school because I felt so disappointed in myself but I don't regret a thing. It makes you stronger as a person, and if you are able to mend your friendships like I have done, then you can do anything. My mom always told me, ""Stephanie, remember that a friend is a gift that you give to yourself. A friend will always be there for the good and the bad. A true friend will never make fun of you. If a friend is a piece of work, then he or she has never been a friend at all. A friend is the biggest gift to you."" Everyone is going to make mistakes but please don't push them away, especially if it's someone you really care about. I know when I make mistake I beat myself up about it. I just wish someone would have reached out a hand to help me back up on my feet like my best friend did. If someone is new or doesn't have a friend, please reach out and befriend them because that small action could mean the world to them.

Why some some females closed their wings when males flew by?	"One kind of female butterfly mates only once in its life -- and then closes its wings to avoid _ "" when pursued by persistent and unwanted males, a Japanese researcher said. Observations of the Small Copper Butterfly, a colourful orange and black butterfly, showed that some females closed their wings when males flew by, but only when they were males of their own species, said Jun-Ya Ide, an associate professor at Kurume Institute of Technology in Fukuoka, western Japan. ""When we looked into why, the males were courting the females. They do this very stubbornly, so the females sometimes try to get away -- or prefer to stay unobserved,"" he added. Ide and his colleagues brought a model of a male butterfly near the females to test their reactions and found that young females that had yet to mate kept their wings open, but those that had already mated closed them. Not only can the persistent attentions of unwanted suitors harm the delicate females, fleeing from them -- with the male often in pursuit -- uses up strength and can even shorten their lives, he added. ""Closing their wings makes them less visible, helping them avoid communication with their own species. We figured they were trying to avoid harassment by males,"" Ide said."

How did Carole feel when she joined the club for the first time?	"A.Choose the best answer (,) Carole's Cooking Journal Monday, April 6 This month, we had to choose an optional activity. Should it really be called ""optional"" if you have to do it? Unfortunately, I waited until the last minute to sign up. Many of the activities were already full, but I made a decision to join the Cooking Club because at least that way I would get a snack to eat. Tuesday, April 7 It was the first time to be here. Like many of my ideas, joining the Cooking Club made sense at first but was turning out to be a disaster. Most people have been in the club for more than a year, so they already know what they're doing. And since they all know each other, they weren't exactly interested in a newcomer. Thursday, April 9 What a terrible day! How could I know that if a recipe says to beat cookie batter , you couldn't do it with your fists ? I thought the other kids would never stop laughing. And it was not easy to get cookie batter off your clothes. Friday, April 10 I have more funny things in Cooking Club. Now I know that chocolate mousse is a dessert and it isn't spelled m-o-o-s-e. ""Mousse"" and ""Moose"" sound exactly the same. So I don't think my question about whether vegetarians can eat chocolate mousse was really that silly.

The writer holds the opinion that _ .	Every Thursday afternoon,my art history class meets not in our usual lecture hall but in the Yale University Art Gallery. We spend our one-hour class discussing two or three of the paintings,many of which are by artists that we have already studied in class. The professor begins by selecting one work of art.After giving us a quick background on the artist,he'll open up for our class discussion.Everyone is strongly encouraged to give opinions about the work.Not every piece we study is necessarily famous or striking in appearance and subject matter.Yet we always manage to make some interesting observations. In America,professors always take every opportunity to push textbooks aside and expose students to real world experiences. With some creativity, almost any subject can be applied to such beyond classroom learning.My art history class trips to the gallery are but one example. Many other subjects also offer opportunities to learn outside the classroom,such as business,psychology, art,journalism and biology. A friend of mine from Yale taking an advanced psychology course spends every Saturday working with mentally disabled children.Her mornings are spent staying with the kids and studying their sometimes uncontrolled behavior.Then in the afternoon she writes a report on her observations. Students generally appreciate these unique learning opportunities. They're almost always fun and interesting,and professors like them because students learn so much in just a few short months. No one denies the value of classroom learning,but it can only take students so far.Slides and textbooks may do a good j ob of carrying facts and dates,but creativity and originality of thought cannot be taught.They can only be got through firsthand experience.

"When you ask an Englishman, ""How old are you?"" He will feel _ ."	"In England, people don't usually talk too much. You can go on a bus, or in a train, and everyone sits looking out of the windows. Often they read. They read books and newspapers. But they don't talk much. When you meet English people, they often talk about one thing, the weather. So when you meet someone in England, you say: ""Nice weather for the time of year!"" ""But it was a little colder yesterday ,"" someone may say. ""But it will be a little warmer later!"" You can say. Talk like this and the English people will think, ""How friendly you are!"" But it' s not good to ask their age , or they will not be happy."	['unhappy']
Why does Ji Ping get up early on Saturdays?	"The weekend is usually a time of rest. But today's Chinese teenagers can't rest during the weekends. According to a survey , 24% of the Junior students in Beijing have classes at the weekend. Over 40% of the Junior 3 students have less than eight hours of sleep each night. Ji Ping, a Junior student in Guangzhou, has to get up at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. Then she has a whole day of classes. On Sunday she gets to extra classes for Maths and English. But she doesn't complain . She says that all her classmates work hard on Sunday. Liu Yang is from Dalian. As a Junior 2 student, his weekends are less busy. But he always spends Saturday in school. On Sunday, after finishing homework, he plays basketball. He feels happy because he still has time to do the things he likes. A few students are lucky. Yang Qing, a Junior 3 student from Zibo, Shangdong, is one of them. At weekends, she usually gets up at 8:00. Then she spends some time doing homework. After that she is free to do what she likes.

Different from the other tried ways, this new technology studies _ to detect lies.	Offering a powerful new tool against terrorism, researchers have found a way to detect lies in the liar's blushing face. The technique, described in the journal Nature, uses a thermal camera to detect the sudden shift of blood flow in the face. The system performed as a traditional polygraph , the scientists report. Pushed by technological advances and with fresh interest since Sept.11, the discovery is part of the development in the scientific study of detection. Although the lie remains a mysterious phenomenon, researchers in recent years have found a number of new methods that might take the place of the polygraph, from brain scans, to slight changes in eye movement, to sparks of electrical activity that signal a person has seen a victim or a crime scene before. The new finding says, when a person tells a lie, there is a sudden change of blood to the area around the eyes. Although the change is not ordinary visible, the blood warms the skin, causing bands of color1 to appear through a camera sensitive to heat. One advantage of the camera can provide answers quickly, and doesn't require a highly trained expert to operate it or explain its results. In theory, this new technology could be used anywhere large numbers of people need to be quickly screened. But some scientists say the technology would need to be improved before it is ready for use, for it is possible that there are other reactions that cause a sudden change in blood flow in the face and there is also the danger that people will learn to fool the machine, the same way they try to fool polygraph examiners by controlling their breathing or taking drugs to relax themselves.

Why did the woman say Chihuahuas are a kind of fox?	"""You know, Chihuahuas aren't actual dogs. They're a kind of fox,"" announced a woman at a party. This woman entirely believed that Chihuahuas are the descendants of the Fennec fox. Many people might believe this: Chihuahuas are similar to foxes in their appearance with long-haired Chihuahuas appearing almost indistinguishable from their wild counterparts . The idea that Chihuahuas are related to foxes isn't uncommon. Even the American Kennel Club, which is usually a highly respected source of information, accepts the belief and the similarity between Chihuahuas and Fennec foxes. Interesting as it is to imagine that Chihuahuas are a breed of the fox, this idea simply can't hold water. Chihuahuas are, in fact, far more closely related to dingoes or wolves than they are to Fennec foxes. Like other dogs, Chihuahuas are able to breed with other members within the same species. The Fennec fox is a member of a different species. Chihuahuas and Fennec foxes are fairly distantly related just like a cat and a tiger are. Their similarities occur only because of a phenomenon known as convergent evolution , in which animals develop similar features to meet similar biological needs. A simple observation of geography further denies the idea that Fennec foxes and Chihuahuas are related. While the Fennec fox was living in the deserts of Africa, the Chihuahua came from Mexico, where it got its common name. Its closest living s are other native Central and South American breeds. Its ancestor, the now nearly-extinct Mexican gray wolf, is also a much closer to the Chihuahua than any other fox. It is common to consider the cute Chihuahua as a little Fennec fox adapted to life, but this theory is not true. Chihuahuas are domestic dogs to the same degree as other dogs. Much as a Chihuahua might look like a fox, it is--and always will be--a dog."	['They partly have the features of foxes in appearance.']
What would the son probably say after reading the words in the diary?	"An 80-year-old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45-year-old highly educated son. Suddenly a crow perched on their window. The father asked his son, ""What is this?"" The son replied, ""It is a crow."" After a few minutes, the father asked his son the 2 time, ""What is this?"" The son said, ""Father, I have just now told you 'It's a crow'."" After a little while, the old father again asked his son the 3 time, ""What is this?"" At this time some expression of was felt in the son's tone when he said to his father. ""It's a crow, a crow, a crow."" A little after, the father again asked his son the 4 time, ""What is this?"" This time the son shouted at his father, ""Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times 'IT IS A CROW'. Are you not able to understand this?"" A little later the father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his son was born. On opening a page, he asked his son to read that page. When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary: ""Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. I did not at all feel irritated, I rather felt affection for my innocent child."""	['Nothing but felt rather ashamed.']
It can be inferred from the passage that colorblindness _ .	"When Jeff Sparkman draws his cartoon superheroes with colored pencils, he often has to ask other people to tell him what color his masked men turned out to be because he's color-blind. Now, a new smart phone application (app) can help him figure out what colors he's using and how the picture looks to most everyone else. The DanKam app, available for iPhone and Android for $2.99, is an application that turns the vague colors that one percent of the population with color-blindness sees into the ""true"" colors as everyone else sees them. In America, an estimated 32 million color-blind Americans--95% are males--can soon have their life improved. ""DanKam takes the stream of data coming in through the phone's camera and changes the colors slightly so they fall within the range that people who are color-blind see,""developer Dan Kaminsky told CNET. He came up with the idea after watching the 2009 film Star Trek with a color-blind friend. It was then that he got to know more about colorblindness like its varying types and degrees. A vast majority, for instance, have trouble seeing red or green due to a genetic defect . Blue-yellow colorblindness, however, is rarer and develops later in life because of aging, illness or head injuries, etc. He started experimenting with one of the most common representations of points in the RGB color model. What the DanKam app attempts to do is to clean up the color space of the image or video signal so that colors can be _ to those suffering from viewing problems. ""You can adjust the app to fit your needs. There is a range and not everyone who is color-blind sees things the same."" Says Kaminsky. Sparkman, a copy editor at CNET, tried out the app and was pleased with the results. ""It would be useful for dressing for a job interview,"" he said. But using it for his art is ""the most practical application."" It worked well on LED and other lights on electronic gadgets, which means Sparkman can now identify the power light on his computer display as green."	['is not necessarily inborn disease']
The writer probably got the information about the new passport photos from _ .	"The passport photographs of the future could turn out to be more than just another pretty picture if a new computer technique developed by Israeli scientists catches on. Researchers at Ben-Gurion University, in Israel, have invented a way to hide information such as a fingerprint or signature in color images. They believe this could improve passport safety or be used to produce product bar codes or designs that cannot be seen. ""The papers can be faxed, scanned and reprinted without hidden data disappearing,"" New Scientist magazine said last week. Joseph Rosen and a team of scientists worked out the new instrument by creating a mathematical model. The model turns a fingerprint or signature into a series of numbers which are used to shape the dots that make up a color picture. ""Each dot can be forced out of the usual place slightly without noticeably changing the final appearance of the image,"" the magazine said. Several images that can be hidden in a single picture are scanned into a computer which does the work. The hidden images or fingerprints cannot be shown until the picture is scanned again. The computer rebuilds the fingerprint by measuring the displacement of the dots in the picture. The magazine said that if he model is used for passport checkpoints the picture can be unscrambled to show the fingerprint or signature and checked against the person holding the passport. The researchers are now working on a handheld, and instrument which could make unscrambling the hidden information easier."	['a magazine']
The airline easyJet designed Sneakairs in order to _ .	"Most airlines go all out to ensure their passengers have the best possible flight experience. Now, Europe's low-budget airline, easyJet, wants to extend the positive experience beyond the plane ride with ""Sneakairs""--smart shoes that allow visitors to explore new cities and towns without ever looking at a map. To transform Sneakairs from an ordinary shoe to a tour guide, all the wearer has to do is enter his or her desired destination into the easyJet smartphone app. A built-in GPS will determine the wearer's starting location while the Google Maps navigation tool will help chart the best route. Whenever a change of direction is necessary, the app will communicate with the appropriate shoe via the Bluetooth and cause it to vibrate . For example, if the wearer needs to turn right, he/she will feel the sensation in the right shoe. Should the user miss the turn, the smart shoes will both vibrate at the same time, reminding him/her to change course. Visitors that wander off the suggested path or decide to take a break for a cup of coffee or a meal have nothing to worry about. The smart app will automatically determine the new location and chart out a new route, once the desired destination is reached. Sneakairs will vibrate three times to inform the user of the arrival and then go back to being ordinary shoes--until their navigation services are needed again! Sneakairs is certainly not the first navigation shoe in the market. However, easyJet is the first airline to offer them to passengers just as they are about to land in an unknown city. However, before Sneakairs can go mainstream, the easyJet team still needs to make some adjustments. Among the challenges that need to be addressed is the smart shoe's three-hour battery life, which is hardly enough for a tourist to catch all the delights a new or town has to offer!"

What help did Liz give the author?	"About 10 years ago my daughter was about 2500 kilometers from Newcastle, and rang me one day crying because of an emotional problem she was facing. She was about 20, and in a town known as Ayrlie Beach in Northern Queensland. I asked her what it was that she needed most in that moment, and she replied that she needed support, and my arms around her would be the best thing that she could hope for! Because I couldn't do that in that exact moment, I asked her to describe her surroundings to me (I have ly no idea 'why', at the time), and said that if she hadn't heard from me in about 30 minutes, she could ring me back. I asked her to stay exactly where she was. After hanging up the phone, I just sat for a few seconds. After only a very short time a phone number jumped into my head. I rang the number and it was a woman who had bought a house from me about 18 months previously, when I was working in Real Estate. My exact words to her were these, ""Oh, it's you Liz, I have no idea why I'm calling you in particular, but my daughter is in trouble in Ayrlie Beach, and I just got the thought to ring you and tell you that. Have you any idea why?"" ""It could be because my son lives there,"" says Liz. ""Oh really, that's got to be it,"" I said. ""Do you mind giving me his phone number, Liz?"" ""Of course not, and I can only hope that he can be of some help!"" I rang straight away (only about 5 minutes have passed since telling my daughter that somehow I'd get her help). Fortunately, he answered immediately, and I told him the story of who I was, and why I'd rung. I gave him the description of my daughter; where she was standing; and that she needed emotional support if he could find it in his heart to help out so unexpectedly like this. ""Oh yes, I can see her,"" he said...""she's right across the street from where I'm standing!"" He walked across the street and told my daughter that her Dad had sent him! Imagine that...she almost fainted: only about 10 minutes had passed since she had rung me! I believe that she said something like this, ""Wow, Dad's getting pretty good at this stuff!"". That's intuition at it's best!"	"[""She gave the author her son's phone number""]"
What can be concluded from Jonathan Smallwood's words?	"Catch yourself daydreaming while washing the dishes again? If this happens often you probably have a pretty capable working memory and a sharper brain, new research suggests. This mind wandering, it seems, actually gives your working memory a workout. Working memory is the mental work space that allows the brain to _ multiple thoughts at the same time. The more working memory a person has, the more daydreaming they can do without forgetting the task at hand. Researchers studied groups of people from the University of Wisconsin-Madison community, ranging in age from 18 to 65. The volunteers were asked to perform simple tasks, like pressing a button every time they took a breath or clicking in response to a letter popping up on a computer screen; these tasks were so easy that their minds were likely to wander, the researchers figured. The researchers checked in periodically, asking the participants if their minds were on task or wandering. When the task was over, they measured each participant's working memory capacity by having them remember letters while doing math questions. Though all participants performed well on the task, the researchers noticed that the individuals who indicated their minds had wandered more than others also scored higher on the working memory test. ""What this study seems to suggest is that, when circumstances for the task aren't very difficult, people who have additional working memory resources allocate them to think about things other than what they're doing,"" said Jonathan Smallwood, a study researcher of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitve and Brain Science. When our minds run out of working memory, these off-topic thoughts can take the main stage without us consciously meaning them to; for instance, arriving at home with no memory of the actual trip, or suddenly realizing that they've turned several pages in a book without understanding any of the words. ""It's almost like your attention was so absorbed in the mind wandering that there wasn't any left over to remember your goal to read,"" study researcher Daniel Levinson, said in a statement. People with overall higher working memory were better able to stay focused when the task at hand required it. Those who had low working memory often had their thoughts drift away from the task, and did less well at it. The findings add to past research suggesting these mind drifts can be positive moments. For instance, daydreaming has often been associated with creativity--researchers think that our most creative and inventive moments come when daydreaming. It's likely that the most intelligent among us also have high levels of working memory, Levinson noted."	['Dealing with some easy jobs, people with higher working memory will daydream.']

Which option is not the advantage of RX1E according to the passage?	"China will soon put its first domestically developed electric aircraft into mass production, and designers expect a huge market at home and abroad. ""The RX1E is scheduled to receive its airworthiness(,,)certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China before the end of this year, with production expected to start next year,"" Yang Fengtian, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Engineering told China Daily on Thursday. ""This will be the first electric aircraft to be certified by our civil aviation authority. The success of the plane means China has become a technology leader in this filed,"" he added. An electric aircraft runs on electric motors, with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming or batteries. Most of today's electric aircraft are experimental demonstration models. The first manned, electrically powered flight was made in 1973. ""We plan to reach an annual production of 100 such aircraft within three years, and the construction of a manufacturing plant that can make 100 RX1Es each year has begun in Shenyang,"" Yang said, adding that the plane, together with a set of batteries, will sell for nearly 1 million yuan ($163,000). The convenience of use, easy maintenance, low operating costs, high safety levels and eco-friendliness will bring the RX1E many buyers to serve a wide range of purposes, such as police patrols, flight training, entertainment and mapping surveys, he added. Yang said he expects that the Chinese market will need at least 1,000 RX1Es to meet the demand from general aviation businesses. With a maximum takeoff weight of 480 kg and a cruise speed of up to 160 kilometers per hour, the RX1E can fly 90 minutes based on a full charging of its batteries.

What was so extraordinary about the expedition?	In 1997, a group of twenty British women made history. Working in five teams with four women in each team, they walked to the North Pole. Apart from one experienced female guide, the other women were all ordinary people who had never done anything like this in their lives before. They managed to survive in an environment which had defeated several very experienced men during the same time period. The women set off as soon as they were ready. Once on the ice, each woman had to ski along while dragging a sledge weighing over 50 kilos. The temperature was always below the freezing point and sometimes strong winds made walking while pulling so much weight almost impossible. It was also very difficult for them to put up their tents when they stopped each night. In such conditions, the women were making good progress if they covered fourteen or fifteen kilometers a day. But there was another problem. Part of the journey was across a frozen sea with moving water underneath the ice and at some points the team would drift back more than five kilometers during the night. That meant that after walking in these very severe conditions for ten hours on one day, they had to spend part of the next day covering the same ground again. Furthermore, each day it took three hours from waking up to setting off and another three hours every evening to set up the camp and prepare the evening meal. So, how did they manage to succeed? They realized that they were part of a team. If any one of them didn't pull her sledge or get her job done, she would endanger the success of the whole expedition. Any form of selfishness could result in the efforts of everyone else being completely wasted, so personal Feelings had to be put on one side. At the end of their journey, the women agreed that it was mental effort far more than physical fitness that got them to the North Pole.	['It was a new experience for most of the women.']
Which of the following statements is TRUE about jeans?	"Jeans are trousers made of a kind of clothe called denim. For many people, blue jeans represent American culture. The history of blue jeans usually begins with a man named Levi Strauss. Although he did not invent the jeans, he is considered the first person to produce and sell this kind of clothing in large amounts. Levi Strauss was born in Bavaria, Germany. In 1847, he and his family moved to the US. He opened a store, first in New York, and then in San Francisco, California. Among the products he sold were jeans. These trousers were especially useful for miners in California who needed clothing made of a strong material. Levi Strauss partnered with a clothing maker named Jacob Davis, who had invented a process for making rivets for jeans. These metal things helped strengthen the blue jean cloth to make the trousers stronger. In 1873, Strauss and Davis received a patent to officially own this invention. They began producing "" copper-riveted waist overalls "". In 1928 the Levi Strauss company used the word ""Levi's"" as the trademark for their products. The 19th-century workers would probably be surprised to know that their trousers would one day become a fashion object. Today, jeans are worn by people of all ages, incomes and lifestyles. Jeans come in many colors other than blue and in many styles and at many prices. A national museum in Washington, D.C. has one of the oldest known pairs of Levi's jeans in its collection. Jeans have come to express different ideas about American culture based on the people who wear them. These include the heroes of the Wild West and famous Hollywood actors like James Dean and Marlon Brando in the 1950s. Writer James Sullivan published a book called Jean: A Cultural History of an American Icon. In the book, he says jeans serve as a sign for two American values, creativity and rebellion ."

Thirty years later what changes took place?	"Thirty years ago not many people would have dreamed of doing the repairs and decorations in their own homes. In those days labor was fairly cheap and most people would have thought it worthwhile to employ a professional painter and decorator, unless of course they were either very hand up or were in the trade themselves. Today, however, it is quite a different story. Men and women in all walks of life turn their hands to all sorts of jobs round the house including painting, papering, putting up shelves and wall units, and tiling walls and floors. Some people with no professional training of any kind have even successfully built their own houses. These jobs have been made easier today by the introduction of prepared materials, which require the minimum amount of skill to use. In every high street throughout Britain nowadays there is at least one ""Do-It-Yourself"" shop containing a vast range of timber, tiles, paints, wallpapers and floor coverings besides tools of every description including power drills and many accessories. ""Do-It-Yourself"" is a booming business; all these shops do a roaring trade and look like continuing to do so. Probably the main reason for the craze is the high cost of present-day labor and the shortage of building firms willing to do small jobs."

The passage mainly tells us that _ .	What will man be like in the future--in 5000 or even 50, 000 years from now? We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago , was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is a relatively short period of time, so we may assume that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modem world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain' s capacity . As time goes on , however , we shall have to use our brains more and more, and eventually we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring about a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact , we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man' s eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however , our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald. Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same, in spite of all these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a human being, with thoughts and emotions similar to our own. ...

Leslie's paintings are extraordinary because _ .	Throughout the history of the arts, the nature of creativity has remained constant to artists. No matter what objects they select, artists are to bring forth new forces and forms that cause change-to find _ where no one has ever seen or experienced it before. Landscape is another unchanging element of art. It can be found from ancient times through the 17th-century Dutch painters to the 19th-century romanticists and impressionists. In the 1970s, Alfred Leslie, one of the new American realists, continued this practice. Leslie sought out the same place where Thomas Cole, a romanticist, had produced paintings of the same scene a century and a half before. Unlike Cole who insists on a feeling of loneliness and the idea of finding peace in nature, Leslie paints what he actually sees. In his paintings, there is no particular change in emotion, and he includes ordinary things like the highway in the background. He also takes advantage of the latest developments of color photography to help both the eye and the memory when he improves his painting back in his workroom. Besides, all art begs the age-old question: What is real? Each generation of artists has shown their understanding of reality in one form or another. The impressionists saw reality in brief emotional effects, the realists in everyday subjects and in forest scenes, and the Cro-Magnon cave people in their naturalistic drawings of the animals in the ancient forests. To sum up, understanding reality is a necessary struggle for artists of all periods. Over thousands of years the function of the arts has remained relatively constant. Past or present, Eastern or Western, the arts are a basic part of our immediate experience. Many and different are the faces of art, and together they express the basic need and hope of human beings.

Which of the following is among the formal duties of the Queen?	"The royal family is a part of British history and cultural identity. Up until the 17th century, people believed that the British king or queen had a ""divine right"" to rule. This was the idea that God chose the king or queen and that he or she was therefore above the law. However, this idea was challenged during the English Civil War, when King Charles the First was put in prison and then killed in 1649. So what role does the British royal family have today? The Queen is head of the UK and the Commonwealth. She has important formal duties that go with her different titles. As Head of State, for example, she represents the UK on visits abroad and invites other world leaders to visit the UK;as Head of the Armed Forces in name, only she can declare when the UK is at war or when a war is over. She has to sign many government and Commonwealth documents every day. Although the royal family does the work for the UK, there are British people called""anti-monarchists ""who do not believe there should be a royal family. One criticism is that the British people should not have to pay for the royal family with their taxes . Today, the royal family works hard to be relevant in the modern world. The Queen still gives a speech to the nation on television at Christmas, but it gets less and less formal every year;now it is even available as a podcast . In 2005, after graduating from university, Prince William spent time teaching English in Uruguay, the sort of work many ordinary young British people do in their gap years."

A student won't _ in a gap year.	"Not everyone goes to university after high school graduation. Some work, others join the army and an increasing number worldwide are taking a ""gap year"" to travel or do community service in their own countries or abroad. They are studying sharks off the Australian coast, building schools in Mexico and learning Spanish or Italian. The concept of a gap year may not be new, but the recent surge of interest certainly is. Some students are putting off admissions. Others, who don't get into the college of their choice, are taking a year to explore new frontiers before reapplying. Students are choosing to take a breather; they are thinking. They are not sure what they are going to do. They are going and exploring some of their interests. They are getting experience they can take to the school they finally go to. It is an idea actively encouraged by colleges. Princeton University has just launched a ""bridge year"" program that will send 10 percent of its incoming class to do volunteer work abroad, starting in 2009. And the Harvard has spent the last 30 years urging incoming students to take a gap year.

Why didn't the big tree want to say anything to the little plant?	"A big, mighty tree stood in a forest. Its branches spread out and its roots went deep in the earth. A lot of people came here to have a rest under it. And a lot of birds stood on its branches to sing and dance. The big tree was very proud all the time. At the foot of the tree, there was a little plant. The plant was thin, and seemed to be blown down by any of a little wind. One day, the two neighbors were having a little chat. ""Well, little one,"" said the tree to the plant, ""why not put your feet deeply in the earth, and raise your head high in the air as I do?"" ""I see there is no need to do so,"" said the plant with a smile. ""In fact, I think I may be safer in this way."" ""Safer?"" said the tree. ""Are you safer than I am? Do you know how deep my roots are in the earth and how strong my branches are? Who can possibly pull me out by the roots or bow my head to the ground?"" And the tree didn't want to say anything to the weak plant. But the tree was to regret its words very soon. One evening, a great hurricane came. It blew the trees off their roots and almost destroyed the forest completely. It uprooted(......)the mighty tree and blew it away with great force. When the storm had gone, the villagers living nearby came to check the damage. The mighty tree lay on the ground, but the little plant still stood there."	['Because the big tree']
What is the main purpose of the writer?	Dear Mr. Barton, I'm writing in the name of the residents' association to inform you of our feelings regarding your behaviour . We've really had just about enough of you.Although we have tried to speak to you civilly on several occasions,you have always responded with a stream of verbal abuse . Ever since you moved in three months ago,you have shown very little consideration for the other residents of the building,despite numerous complaints.For the past six weekends in a row, you have held extremely noisy parties,which have not finished until the early hours of the morning.It's just not on! As you are aware,most of the people here are old people or have very young children,and the noise keeps them awake all night.You don't have to be so noisy,do you? Last weekend the situation _ further when two of your acquaintances were involved in a fight on the first floor landing.The disturbance was so bad that the police had to be called.What's more,your mates left the stairs in a terrible state--they even broke two windows on their way out! We feel that this type of bad behaviour is unbearable. We strongly recommended that you arrange payment for this damage to the windows,soon.If you don't and you carry on being a nuisance ,we will kick you out! Legal steps will be taken if necessary. Yours sincerely	['To inform Mr. Barton of the noise he made.']
According to the text, young people want to make a new culture of their own, because _ .	"It is natural that young people are often uncomfortable when they are with their parents. They say that their parents don't understand them. They often think that their parents are out of touch with modern ways: that that they are too serious and too strict with their children; and they seldom give their children a free hand. It is true that parents often find it difficult to win their children's trust and they are easy to forget how they themselves felt when young. For example, young people like to act right away without much thinking. It is one of their ways to show that they have grown up and they can face any difficult situation. Older people worry more easily. Most of them plan things ahead, at least in their minds, and do not like their plans to be upset by something unexpected. When you want your parents to let you do something, you will have better success, if you ask before you really start doing it. Young people often make their parents angry with their choices in clothes, in entertainment and in music. But they do not mean to cause any trouble; it is just that they feel cut off from the older people's world, into which they have not yet been accepted. That's why young people want to make a new culture of their own. And if their parents like their music of entertainment or clothes or their ways of speech, this will make young people especially happy. Sometimes you are so proud of yourself that you do not want your parents to say ""yes"" to what you do. All you want is to be left alone and do what you like. It is natural enough, after being a child for so many years, when you were completely under your parents' control. If you plan to control your life, you'd better win your parents over and try to get them to understand you. If your parents see that you have a high sense of responsibility, they will certainly give you the right to do what you want to do."	"[""they don't feel they belong to the world of older people""]"
According to the passage, many people think _ is the best time to visit Quebec.	Canada is famous for its winter lifestyle, for the season lasts half the year there. A great example of this is the Quebec Winter Carnival . Quebec is an old city with beautiful historic building, and many agree that winter is the best time to visit. The city comes alive in the snow, especially during the winter festival. People who visit the cold city can find tons of things to do that will make winter seem perfect. The Carnival has a magical ice palace made with 9,000 tons of snow, a boat race on the St. Lawrence River, and two night parades with funny people and colorful cars. Other interesting things include a 122-meter ice slide, and a large football game. There is also an exciting dogsled race that runs through six kilometers of the city's streets. With more than 20 teams in the game, the dogsled race is noisy, fun and full of great cheer. Even better, artists from around the world come to enter the snow sculpture competition. It is amazing how these artists can bring snow to life. The Quebec Winter Carnival has everything for the whole family and more. It is surely a great way to experience winter at its fullest. Another famous winter festival is on the other side of the world in China. Known as the City of Ice, Harbin is the capital city of Heilongjiang Province, which is next to Siberia. In the winter, it is very cold, and temperatures there can drop to 30degC below zero. Even so, the cold weather makes the city the right place for the Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival. The festival is held every year.	['winter']
Mobile technology has constantly been improved to _ .	"As long as you have broadband service in your home, you can turn on your desktop computer and connect to the Internet. If you have a wireless router , a device that spreads the broadband connection to other devices, you can set up a Wi-Fi network, which enables your cellphones and tablets go online too. And when you are outdoors where is no Wi-Fi, such as in the park or at the beach, having 3G service allows you to stay connected. It seems that lots of us have Internet coverage everywhere we go. So why have mobile companies around the world lately been so enthusiastic about a new term, ""4G""? First, you need to know that the letter :G"" stands for ""generation"". Even if you have no idea what 4G is, at least you can figure out that it is a step up from 3G since it's the latest generation of mobile internet service. Unlike broadband, mobile Internet uses the same signal towers that provide voice service to your cellphone, which means wherever you can make phone calls with your cellphone you also have an Internet connection. But mobile connections have their _ : they don't carry as much information as broadband does, making opening websites and downloading music slower than they are on a Wi-Fi connection. This is why mobile connections have been constantly upgraded since the first generation was launched back in the 1980s. According to BBC, 4G is five to seven times faster than current 3G network speeds, almost as fast as home broadband. Because of this, 4G is widely suited for services like video downloading, mapping, online shopping and even video conferencing. To achieve the high speeds, network companies have to spend a lot of money on building new signal towers, which will eventually lead to a higher phone bill if you switch to 4G, and you will also have to get a new phone with 4G capacity."

With provided tuition, Diana still works after school because she knows _ .	"When it came to role models, Diana Ortiz said her mother, Marcia Dominguez, was the ""hero"". Ms. Dominguez came to the United States from Cuba in 1979. She went to college and got a job as a social worker --- all the while raising three children in America mostly on her own. ""It was always school first,"" Diana said, ""My mom had us in a straight line. If we got out of line, she corrected us. She was a perfect woman. She was beautiful, she had the education and she had everything --- but the illness took over. When I was 11, it frightened me to see how quickly my mother's health was ruined by cancer. A week before I turned 14, my mother died at age 50. I had tried to prepare myself, but on the first morning I woke up without my mother, the sense of loss was painful."" Diana had not seen her father for five years, who refused to provide for her. Diana then entered the city's foster care system. She has spent about four years in foster homes. Despite Diana's hard teenage years, the values her mother had planted in her mind inspired her to go after higher education. Since August 2010, she has been a fulltime student majoring in law. A public organization offers her tuition but she has part-time jobs to help people like her and earn more life experience. Her goal is a job in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For now, Diana works 20 hours a week as a cashier at Marshalls, earning $7.25 an hour. In November, she moved into her own public housing studio apartment on the Lower East Side. She pays $236 a month in rent. Although she is out of foster care, Diana has been speaking at workshops for foster youths. She emphasizes that nothing should get in the way of their success, not the trials of their lives or what they may have lost. ""I tell the young who have the similar experience like me, 'Why are you going to let what happened to you affect you in the long run?' "" Diana said. "" 'Why are you going to sit there and feel sorry for yourself? You're wasting precious time.' It is a message my mother would approve of. My mom taught me that everything is not given to you. You have to go out and get it."""	['success comes with her own struggle and efforts']
What's the writer's main argument against mobile phones?	Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something 'important'.

Xu Canyong can't live with his two kids in Shantou because _ .	"Recently, the TV show Where Are We Going, Dad? has become one of China's most popular TV shows, attracting more than 600 million viewers each week. In this program, five celebrity fathers traveled to six countryside locations across China, including some villages in Beijing, Yunnan, Shandong, Hunan, Heilongjiang and a desert in Ningxia. They took care of their kids without the help of the kid's mothers. At the same time, they also took part in different kinds of activities with their kids together, such as cooking, fishing and selling goods. Why is the show so popular? ""It reflects social reality.

Which of the following is true of Mr. Henry?	"James Arruda Henry, a 98-year-old retired lobsterman, has written and published his first book, ""In a Fisherman's Language"", after learning to read at the incredible age of 91.

A family problem in his 90s sparked his encourage to restart his education.""He signed a document he could not read,"" Mr Henry's granddaughter said. And then, after hearing about George Dawson, a son of slaves who learned to read at the age of 98 and went on to write a book of his own, entitled ""Life Is So Good"" at the age of 101, Mr. Henry took up reading.

According to the scientists' observation, _ .	"Scientists are worried that an asteroid will possibly hit the earth in 2036. If scientists are right, planet earth is 24 years away from a major disaster. Scientists have been monitoring the progress of a 390-metre-wide asteroid ever since it was discovered last June. They have announced that it could hit the earth, causing huge damage, in 2036. NASA estimates that the impact from the asteroid named after Apophis and ancient Egyptian demon would release more than 100,000 times the energy released in the nuclear explosion over Hiroshima. Thousands of square kilometers would be directly affected by the explosion. The whole planet would see the effects of the dust released into the atmosphere. This is the worst possible scenario of any asteroid in recorded history. Having more than 20 years' warning of possible impact might seem plenty of time. But scientists insist that there is actually very little time left to decide. Luckily, however, they aren't short on ideas for the asteroid. The favored method is also probably the easiest--throwing a spacecraft at the asteroid to change its direction. The European Space Agency plans to test this in the next decade. One idea that seems to have no support from astronomers is the use of explosive, although this sounds more likely to the public or Hollywood producer. At present, scientists are trying to make a better estimate of how much time we have, through more observations. In spring of next year, there will be another chance for radar observation of Apophis. This will help astronomers calculate the orbits of the asteroid more accurately. If, at that stage, they can't rule out an impact with the earth in 2036, the next chance to make better observations will not be until 2016, then 2029. ""If we wait until 2029 and the worst--case scenario turns out to be true, it would seem unlikely that we'd be able to do anything about 2036,"" warns Prof Fitzsimmons."

When grandma came out of the bedroom, she walked on tiptoe. When grandpa came back, he said nothing about the weather. At breakfast Mother passed us the fruit and said something, but her voice was too high. At last my sister, Lou, pushed back her chair. ""It's your turn to wash the dishes."" But I had washed the dishes the night before. I said nothing because it was not right to quarrel in front of Dad just home with the empty sleeve. ""It is your turn,"" Lou said again. I looked at her in surprise. ""It is not,"" I said because I suddenly remembered Mother had told us to go on as usual. ""Children, children,"" Mother said in a quiet, glad kind of voice.

The result of the research suggests that _ .	"Some students get so nervous before a test, they do poorly even if they know the material. Sian Beilock, a psychology professor at the University of Chicago in Illinois, has studied these highly anxious test-takers. Sian Beilock says: ""They start worrying about the consequences. They might even start worrying about whether this exam is going to prevent them from getting into the college they want. And when they worry, it actually uses up attention and memory resources. I talk about _ as their cognitive horsepower that they could otherwise be using to focus on the exam."" Professor Beilock and another researcher, Gerardo Ramirez, have developed a possible solution. Just before an exam, highly anxious test-takers spend ten minutes writing about their worries about the test. The researchers tested the idea on a group of 20 anxious college students. They gave them two short math tests. After the first one, they asked the students to either sit quietly or write about their feelings about the upcoming second test. The researchers added to the pressure. They told the students that those who did well on the second test would get money. They also told them that their performance would affect other students as part of a team effort. Professor Beilock says those who sat quietly scored an average of 12 percent worse on the second test. But the students who had written about their fears improved their performance by an average of five percent. Next, the researchers used younger students in a biology class. They told them before final exams either to write about their feelings or to think about things unrelated to the test. Professor Beilock says highly anxious students who did the writing got an average grade of B+, compared to a B-for those who did not. The research shows that for students who are highly test-anxious, who'd done the writing intervention , all of a sudden there was no relationship between test anxiety and performance. Those students most likely to worry were performing just as well as their classmates who don't normally get nervous in these testing situations. But what if students do not have a chance to write about their fears immediately before an exam or presentation? Professor Beilock says students can try it themselves at home or in the library and still improve their performance."	['facing the fears bravely may help one to achieve more']
According to the passage,we learn that Professor Xiao _ .	"Skiping classes violates school rules and a poor attendance record will damage your final mark. But some college students still try every means to escape classes. The number of these rebels may be much bigger than you think. Three students from Anhui Normal University established Itaoke. Com in June. The website quickly attracted 2 000 registered members in three months. On the website, students share their experiences of skipping classes and even post ads to look for someone to stand in for them to attend courses. Its embarrassing for universities to see this shameful behavior discussed: However,it's good for schools and teachers to know via the website the reasons why students skip classes,according to Professor Xiao Haitao from Shenzhen University: Xao pointed out that some`students skip classes because of laziness.Others play truant because the teaching is truly dissatisfactory,""Universities can seek improvements to give a cure to the class-skipping problem,""said Xiao. Chen Yang,21,thinks that he is ""forced"" to skip some courses because of the poor teaching. the senior,majoring in English at Yangtze University, thinks that he's wasting time in the classroom when the teacher reads the textbook word for word or hands him outdated reading materials. He would rather skip classes to study in the library, watch online videos of Harvard or Yale lectures,or sit in on other courses he is interested in. Chen draws a clear line between himself and those who skip classes in order to get more sleep or fool around on campus. He emphasized:""I skip classes with a clear goal,which is to probe into areas I'm interested in and broaden my horizons."" Li Sicen,President of the National Taiwan University,seems to be on Chen's side. Li claimed that he supported those students who skip classes for good reasons. However,Professor Xiao warns students that Li is not giving permission for students to skip classes. Xiao suggests that Li was just showing his understanding of truancy in a limited number of cases. In Professor Pan Cuiqiong's opinion,students tend to jump to the conclusion that a certain course is boring and useless. ""To clear students' misunderstanding,teachers should use materials closely related to students'lives and adapt interactive teaching methods,""said Pan. Besides offering teachers more training,schools also need to give students different optional courses and ensure that they can attend the courses they are interested in,according to Professor Xiao. Many Chinese students have the experience of being kicked out of an optional course because its size is limited. They are then forced to choose courses they dislike and are likely to skip them. We may learn from Sydney University in Australia. There aren't any problems with numbers---if a course is popular then there will be more than one class per week."

Which of the following shows that the Broadway experts agree with the author?	Like most people, I have grown up hearing the story Cinderella, in which a young girl lived with her cruel stepmother and suddenly had her life changed by a kind fairy and a smart prince. So when to see Rodger & Hammerstein's Cinderella, which is now playing on Broadway, I was very excited, As soon as I sat down, I noticed the trees lining the stage ,which gave it a magical appearance. The orchestra started to play and the lights became dark as the show began. I loved the entire performance. Everything and everyone on stage seemed like they had just jumped off the pages of the beloved story. It turns out that the Broadway experts agree with me. The show has received nine Tony nominations . Tony awards are the top prizes for Broadway shows. Laura Osnes, who plays the role of Cinderella, has been nominated for the Tony for best actress in a musical. How similar is the show to the story of Cinderella you know? The answer, of course, depends on which version of the story you've seen or read. In an interview with TIME FOR Kids, Osnes pointed out that many people are familiar with the Disney movie version. There are some differences between that movie and the Broadway show. For one thing, the stepmother and the sisters are not as cruel in the show as in the movie. Also, in the Broadway version, when Cinderella escapes from the dancing party, she picks up her shoe after dropping it. So how does the prince find Cinderella again? You'll have to see the show to find out! I just think anyone would enjoy this play, including both kids and adults. The attention to detail is amazing. In my opinion, this play deserves a double thumbs-up!	['Broadway experts have given the show nine Tony nominations.']

The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives. No creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail . Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world. There are countless people who, ever since their early years, have learned to associate snails with food. My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are not liked. As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own. For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him. The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after heavy shower, I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prized plants. Acting on a sudden impulse, I collected several dozen, put them in a paperbag,and took them to Robert. Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift. I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours. 1 had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner. Snails would, of course, be the main dish. I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room. To our dismay, we saw that there were snails everywhere: they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall! I have never been able to look at a snail since then.

On which of the following did people spend less money than before?	In the United States ,the biggest change in spending has been in the amount spent on food ,which has decreased from 46% of the total family budget in 1901 to 19% of present day totals .This is due to the fact that people are now able to buy more and better foods at lower prices. As a result of the growth in fast-food restaurants (for example, McDonad's or KFC), more people are also eating out. Thus about 30% of today's food budget goes on meals eaten outside the home while a hundred years ago it was only 3%. At the beginning of the 20th century, few people owned their homes (only around 19% of working families )and cars (at $ 1,000 per car this was well above the average family income of $ 650 per year) , as most people were unable to borrow money. But there was a rapid rise in both home and car ownership during the mid-1900s. Free time increased considerably following the shortening of the working week, i. e. from six days to five ,and from ten hours to eight hours a day. In fact, the working day couldn't be too long, otherwise people wouldn't have the time to spend their money. The amount of a family's budget spent on outside entertainment ,such as parties, films and concerts has increased from just under 6% in Ford's day to about 9% today. On the other hand, we spend only a quarter of what our great-grandparents paid for reading materials. It is difficult to see how our spending patterns may change in the future. We already know that our population is aging and this will have an effect on the amount of money we spend on medical care.	['Reading.']
Who caught the man with a large mouth and small ears?	"The big red American car was much too wide for an English country road. When Jack saw it coming toward him, he stopped his own car at the side of the road to make room for it to pass. The American car went slowly past, so close that he could see the driver's face quite clearly. ""Where have I seen that face before?"" he thought. ""Wait a minute! I remember now. It was in the newspaper!"" He took out the newspaper from his bag, turned quickly to the middle page. There was a picture of his face in it. Yes, it had a large mouth and small ears, and his eyes were behind dark glasses. ""Wanted by the police,"" read by Jack. ""The City Bank will give a lot of money to anyone who helps the police to catch this man."" ""Call the police at once"", he said to himself. But a few minutes later, he was sad. ""This man was caught this morning"", answered the police."	['The police']
When you are safe outside a burning building , stay away from the door so that _ .	In England a woman fell down a stair. Panic followed--178 persons lost their lives. In Michigan a woman fell ill. There was a call for water. Someone thought it meant fire---71 were killed. In Oklahoma an old man's hair caught fire---36 died. What should you do to be out of danger? 1. As you sit in any crowd, pick out an exit which is not the one where most persons enter and plan to use if necessary. 2. If a rush stairs, do not get into it . Stay still. Let it pass. Then go to the exit you have chosen. 3. Do not cry out. Speak quietly. Act calmly. 4.Do not stop for your hat and coat unless they are at hand. 5. If there is smoke, crouch. The best air is about three feet above the floor. 6. When you are outside the building, stay out. Many dead would be alive if they had not returned for something. 7. When you get out, move far from the door so that others can get out.	['others may leave.']

Which of the followings can serve as the best title for the passage?	There was a huge battle between the warriors of Greece and the people of Troy. Prince Paris from Troy had stolen away the Greek queen; Helen. The Greek warriors set sail for Troy to fight for their queen. The battle outside Troy lasted for ten years. The men were fed up and wanted to return to their homes. Athene, goddess of war gave Ulysses the idea for a plan to end the war. They built a big wooden horse which they put in the middle of their encampment . Next they pretended to give up their camp. In reality many soldiers hid inside the wooden horse. Once they thought the camp had been abandoned the Trojans went out to check. They needed to know if the war was really over. They walked through the abandoned encampment and eventually found the wooden horse. They could not decide what it was. Some wanted to take it into the city, others thought that it was a gift to Zeus and feared touching or moving it in case they upset Zeus. Some Trojans decided to take it back into the city. They called a large group of troops, attached ropes and pulled it into the city. A huge celebration started. The city was free from war for the first time in nine years. Everybody feasted, drank and danced until eventually the merriment was over and they all went to sleep. This was the moment that the wooden horse opened a big flap hidden underneath. Out crept Ulysses and all of his men. They killed the sleeping troops, rescued Queen Helen, met up with the rest of their army and set sail for home. The story of the return journey is told in The Odyssey, a collection of poems piecing together the bits of the story from the many different places where the story took place.	['The Trojan Horse']

The author mentioned stories of two women in order to _ .	"I learned a long time ago that hair has meanings--plenty of meanings. Growing up in the 1960s, my friends and I struggled without parents' control over the length and style of our hair. At the time, hair represented our need to break free from adults in our lives. Long hair represented our freed inner selves. My clients are often surprised when I asked them questions about their hairstyle--why they choose it, how else they've worn their hair, how they feel about it, and so on. However, while it may seem to be a simple topic, even today our hairstyles still have many psychological and emotional meanings. Understanding some of those meanings can lead to understanding of many different aspects of a person's mind. How we view our hair, for example, can show something about how we view ourselves. Our hair can show physical and emotional wellbeing, desirability, and even social and financial status. When it becomes dull or fragile, it can communicate emotional and physical diseases. But hair can also show unrecognized and often unspoken daydreams about oneself and one's world. One woman--a successful professional--wore her long hair in a thick bun . But one day she showed me that tangled hair was kept in the bun. She said that she never brushed out the tangles because the hair showed her secret image of herself as a helpless, disturbed woman, like Ophelia in the play Hamlet. Another woman came to therapy in a huge shirt and huge pants that she believed they could hide the weight she had put on since the birth of her child. She talked about how much she hated her body and how helpless she felt about doing anything about it. But her hair was always beautifully coloured and decorated. When I pointed out that she seemed to have a different relationship with her hair from she did with her body, she said that her hair had been thinning and that she was trying to make it look as good as she could. I pointed out that what she was doing with her hair and her body was kind of contradictory, and wondered if she had any thoughts about that. She was surprised. But as we talked about her contradictory attitudes towards different parts of her physical self, we began to open up all sorts of other thoughts and ideas about her inner self. And interestingly, as we continued opening those internal doors, changes started to happen. She started eating differently and exercising regularly. One day some months later, she appeared in my office in skinny jeans and a tight sweater, and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail. ""I decided to see what would happen if I stopped trying to hide myself, "" she said with a big smile. ""And...? "" I asked. ""People keep smiling at me in the street. My husband hugged me this morning for the first time in ages. And I feel good! "" Besides, selfrespect in both men and women can be damaged by thinning hair;they may feel alone even though they are really not. Given our cultural focus on physical appearance, youth, and health, hair loss can be unpleasant for both men and women. The market is filled with hairenhancing treatments, but there are those who have decided to be against the system and change to the ""bald is beautiful"" position. But it is much harder for women to take the ""bald is beautiful"" approach to hair loss. We tend to try to hide it in one way or another. But no matter what approach you use, it is important to remember that the thickness of your hair has nothing to do with your value in the world. Remember that you have nothing to be ashamed of if you have thinning hair. Thinning hair may not be something you can change, but it doesn't have to control how you represent the person who lives underneath it."	['prove her idea']
What did the author feel about her performance?	"My first performance in front of an audience was coming up soon. I tried as hard as I could to remain calm, but my heart was racing. I stared down at my sweat-covered, shaking hands. I looked up again at the audience, realizing that these were real people. They were not just my mum and dad, who would say, ""Good job!"" even if I messed up the entire piece. What if I had the wrong music? What if I played the wrong notes? As it turned out, I was never able to answer these questions because the spotlight was waiting for me. I grasped my hands tightly together, drying off the sweat. Slowly I walked to the mud-brown piano in the center of the room. It contained 88 demanding keys, which were waiting impatiently to be played. I swallowed the golf-ball-sized lump in my throat and sat down. Slowly, I opened the music. Next, I rested my still shaking hands on the ivory keys. As my fingers played across the keys, I was becoming more unsure of my preparation for this moment. But the memory of my years of training came flooding back. I knew that I had practiced this piece so many times that I could play it backwards if requested. Although at one point I accidentally played two keys instead of the intended one, I continued to move my fingers automatically . My eyes burned holes into (were fixed on) the pages in front of me. There was no way that I was going to lose my concentration. To keep this to myself, I leaned forward and focused carefully on the music. When I came to the end of the page, a warning went off inside my head: DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE WHEN YOU TURN THE PAGE! Needless to say, I obeyed myself with all my heart and mind. And, proud of my ""page-turning"" feat , I finished the rest of the piece without making a single mistake. After the final note died away, a celebration went into action inside my head. I had finished. I had mastered the impossible."	['She thought it was very difficult but successful.']
What is the big room ?	"I can still remember my first day at school. I was only 6 years old at that time. It was a very big room. I sat at the desk near the window, but I couldn't see anything because the windows were too high. There was a big map of the world on the wall. But I don't think I was worried or unhappy at that time. There was another little boy next to me. He sat there and kept quiet at first. Then he began to cry, because he didn't want to stay there. More and more students came in , but the boy didn't stop crying "" Mom, I want to go home. "" He cried again and again. Later , the teacher came in . She went to the little boy, and said something to him. I couldn't hear what she said. Soon the boy stopped crying and began to smile. To this day, I still don't know what the teacher said to the little boy."	"[""It's the classroom.""]"

From the passage we can infer that _ .	"The United Nations is warning that the world is not prepared to deal with the fast growth of cities. The World Economic and Social Survey 2013 calls for new ways to meet the needs of city populations. More than 6.5 billion people are expected to be living in cities by 2050. Most new city dwellers will be in developing countries. The United Nations says the effect on limited resources in many countries will be huge. The World Economic and Social Survey points to the increasing demand for energy, water, sanitation, public services, education and health care. The world population is expected to rise to more than nine billion by 2050, two-thirds of all people are expected to live in cities. The United Nations says about 80 percent of this growing urban population will be found in Africa and Asia. The report says sustainable development of urban areas requires coordination and investments to deal with important issues, these include land-use, food security, job creation and transportation. Willem Van Der Geest is with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, he says cities need to work closely with rural communities, so that food supplies can be secured, and the environment can be protected. ""We need enough integration(,) with cities... An integration between the rural and urban economies is absolutely vital for issues of nutrition, food security, and environmental sustainability."" The report says development in a sustainable way is important to end poverty. The report also examines the problem of food insecurity, which affects hundreds of millions of people around the world. One in eight people still severely lack nutrition. UN officials say some things are clear. The Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, Shamshad Akhtar, says world food production will have to increase by 70%, that increase will be needed to feed the additional 2.3 billion people expected on the planet by the middle of the century.

In the Philippines Islands _ was once used as money.	Today anyone will accept money in exchange for goods and services. People use money to buy food, furniture, books, bicycles and hundreds of other things we need or want. When they work, they usually get paid in money. Lots of the money today is made of paper. But people used to use all kinds of things as money. One of the first kinds of money was shells. Shells were not the only things used as money. In China, cloth and knives were used. In the Philippine Islands, rice was used as money for a long time. Some Africans once used elephant tusks, monkey tails, and salt as money. The first metal coins were made in China. They were round and had a square hole in the center. Different countries have used different metals and designs for their money. Later, countries began to make coins of gold and silver. But even gold and silver were inconvenient if you had to buy something expensive. Again the Chinese thought of a way to improve money. They began to use paper money. The first paper money looked more like a note from one person to another than the paper money used today. Money has had an interesting history, from the days of shell money until today.	['rice']

According to this passage, we can know that _ .	"""Mobile phone killed my man,"" screamed one headline last year. Also came claims that an unpublished study had found that mobile phones could cause memory loss. And a British newspaper devoted its front page to a picture supposedly showing how mobile phones could heat the brain. For anyone who uses a mobile phone, these are worrying times. But speak to the scientists whose work is the focus of these scares and you hear a different story. One of the oddest effects comes from the now famous""memory loss"" study. Alan Preece and his colleagues at the University of Bristol placed a device that imitated the microwave radiation of mobile phones to the left ear of volunteers. The volunteers were good at recalling words and pictures they had been shown on a computer screen. Preece says he still can't comment on the effects of using a mobile phone for years on end. But he rules out the suggestion that mobile phones have an immediate effect on our cognitive abilities. ""I'm pretty sure there is no effect on short-term memory,"" he says. Another expert, Tattersall, remarked that his latest findings have removed fears about memory loss. One result, for instance, suggests that nerve cell synapses exposed to microwaves become more -- rather than less -- receptive to undergoing changes linked to memory formation. An even happier outcome would be that microwaves turned out to be good for you. It sounds crazy, but a couple of years ago a team led by William Adey at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California found that mice exposed to microwaves for two hours a day were less likely to develop brain tumours when given a cancer-causing chemical. ""If _ doesn't certainly cause cancer in animals and cells, then it probably isn't going to cause cancer in humans,"" says William. And while there's still no absolute evidence that mobile phone use does damage your memories or give you cancer, the conclusion is: don't be afraid."	"[""there's no need to worry about the radiation from mobile phones""]"
Many people still prefer washing dishes by hand to machine washing because _ .	"Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, ""Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?"" she probably would have answered, ""Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!"" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do."

She was all excited about a story about homeless pets because of Hurricane Katrina and all that was going on to help them. She said that this information came from her animal newspaper (your KIND News). Kaileen has a great love and compassion for animals, so her excitement did not surprise me. Her next ideas, however, did. She said that we should go around right then to our neighbors and collect all their change to send to the animal shelters . I thought this was a school project, but in fact, it was not. This was what Kaileen wanted to do on her own! Well, it warmed me all over. To see your child so willing to help others just lets you feel that maybe you had done something right in raising her. Anyway, I told her to make a card and send it out to our neighbors first. With the help of her older brother, Kaileen soon made a lovely card that asked our neighbors to help these pets by giving their spare change. She gave them a few days and a date she would come by to pick up any donations . Well, I had to go out and buy a donation box. Kaileen collected $279.50!!! I just thought you would like to know how KIND News had touched a little one's heart and given her the idea to show her compassion for animals. Thank you -- we really enjoy your paper.	['parent']

Which of the following best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS ?	"Astronauts on shorter shuttle missions often work very long days. Tasks are scheduled so tightly that break times are often used to finish the day's work. This type of schedule is far too demanding for long missions on the International Space Station(ISS). ISS crewmembers usually live in space for at least a quarter of a year. They work five days on and two days off to _ the normal way they do things on Earth as much as possible. Weekends give the crew valuable time to rest and do a few hours of housework. They can communicate with family and friends by email , internet phone and through private video conferences. While astronauts cannot go to a baseball game or a movie in orbit, there are many familiar activities that they can still enjoy . Before a mission, the family and friends of each ISS crewmember put together a collection of family photos, messages, videos and reading material for the astronauts to look at when they will be floating 370 kilometers above the Earth. During their mission, the crew also receives care packages with CDs, books, magazines, photos and letters . And as from early 2010, the internet became available on the ISS , giving astronauts the chance to do some ""web surfing ""in their personal time. Besides relaxing with these more common entertainments, astronauts can simply enjoy the experience of living in space.

Dr. Paris often reminds himself that _ .	"Connecting with Patients Dr. Paris often treats several generations of a family over many years. ""He's seen us through two births, one operation, multiple earaches, a broken wrist and a recovery from a serious traffic crash,"" says Jill Farrow, a 43-year-old lawyer whose first visit to Dr. Paris was as a teenager. During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. ""Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,"" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. ""I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,"" he recalls. ""I'm lucky to be alive."" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married."	['it is the duty of a doctor to heal the patients']
How many places has Daisy been to?	"One day, Daisy dreamed a strange dream. She flew in a wonderful carpet to talk with an antelope in Tibet. The antelope told her they were hunted because of their fur which can be used to make sweaters like hers. Later, she flew to Zimbabwe where she talked with an elephant and got to know the farmers there no longer hunted them. That's because the government decided to help and the farmers finally made a lot of money. At last, she arrived at the thick rainforest where a monkey told her ""no rain forest, no animals and no drugs."" Although finally everything was gone, she hadlearned so much."	['3']
We may infer that films with sound probably came into being _ .	"Even people who don't understand English can enjoy Chaplin's films because they are mostly silent. It isn't what he says that makes us laugh. It depends upon actions which mean the same thing to people all over the world. He is _ of the art - a kind of world language. As a young man, he and his brother traveled to America in a small company of actors. Chaplin was then invited to join a new company that was making film comedies. Very soon he had made dozens of short films for this company. And it was in his second film that he wore the clothes which made his reputation - black hat, tight coat, baggy trousers, huge shoes, moustache and walking stick. He intended simply to make people laugh. But the odd make-up made him look both comic and sad. By the time he was thirty, Chaplin was the greatest, best known and best loved comedian in the world. He received thousands of dollars for each film he made. He had formed his own manner of acting. He was welcomed by excited crowds wherever he went. But he worked very hard and had few close friends. Perhaps that is why the sad side of the little tramp began to show more clearly in the films he made. The little man began to want more than food and a roof over his head. He began to want love. In one of his most famous films ""The Gold Rush"" a girl plays tricks on the little man. Then she begins to feel sorry for him and treats him kindly. He mistakes her pity for love. The girl in ""City Lights"" is blind. She thinks he is the most wonderful man she has ever met. But then she recovers her sight and sees what a foolish figure he is. This sadness gives Chaplin's films a depth of human experience which few comedians can equal. After living in America for forty years he moved to Switzerland. There he died on Christmas Day 1977. He once described himself as a citizen of famous pictures that were made during the 1920s and 1930s, the time of the silent films. But, to many people all over the world Chaplin will always be the king of comedy."	['after the 1930s']

"The sentence ""Michael is imaginary, but his lifestyle is very possible"" means _ ."	Michael stays home on workdays. He plugs into his personal computer terminal in order to connect with the office. After work, he puts on his headphones, watches a movie on his home video recorder, or plays baseball on the computer. On many days, Michael doesn't talk to any other human beings, and he doesn't see any people except the ones on television. _ The inventions of modern technology seem to be cutting us off from contact with our fellow human beings. The world of business is one area in which technology is separating us. Experts say, for example, that many people will soon be able to work at home. With access to a large central computer, employees such as office clerks, insurance agents, and accountants could do their jobs at display terminals in their own homes. They would never have to actually see the people they're dealing with. In addition, the way employees are paid will change. Workers' salaries will be automatically paid into their bank accounts, making paper checks unnecessary. No workers will stand in line to receive their pay or cash their checks. Personal banking will change, too. Customers will deal with machines to put in or take out money from their accounts. Another area that technology is changing is entertainment. Music, for instance, was once a group experience. People listened to music at concert halls or in small social gatherings. For many people now, however, music is an individual experience. Walking along the street or sitting in their living rooms, they wear headphones to build a wall of music around them. Movie entertainment is changing, too. Movies used to be social events. Now, fewer people are going out to see a movie. Many more are choosing to wait for a film to appear on television or are borrowing videotapes to watch at home. Instead of laughing with others, viewers watch movies in their own living looms.	['Michael is not a real person but the lifestyle does exist']

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"In April this year, lots of bags full of small change were seen at bus stops in Tianjin. They were made for passengers to turn their notes into small change. And such an idea came from four students from Zhongbei Middle School, Tianjin. ""People will surely feel worried when they take a bus without coins. We just want to do something to help them,"" said Wang Yongcun, 15, one of the four students. The four boys spent their whole weekend making the change bags. After that they went to see the number of the passengers at each bus stop near their school, and then chose the top six stops to put the bags. Many people think that the four boys have really done a good job. But, things didn't go as the boys thought. Two days later, they found that the money was gone, and that even the bags were taken. It really made them sad but they would not give up. Their classmates and teachers came to help them in time. They put their pocket money in bags again. And the teachers also taught them to make better change bags. They tried their best to do it. The four boys feel very happy because they have done something good for the passengers. Their warm hearts are moving. More and more people are beginning to join in the activity."	['The idea of small change bags came from four boys.']

The PCRM proposed that milk be removed from the lunch program because _ .	"""Drink your milk. It's good for you!"" You've probably heard that many times, and it's true. Milk contains calcium , which is necessary for keeping bones and teeth healthy and strong. The US government even requires milk as part of the National School Lunch Program, saying that students should drink one cup of fat-free or low-fat milk every meal. However, a group of doctors asked the government to take it away from the lunch program. The US 'Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) says, ""Milk is high in sugar, fat and animal protein,"" all of which have negative effects on health. The PCRM says there are better and healthier ways to get calcium such as eating beans, broccoli, cereals and tofu. Orange juice and soymilk that have calcium added to them also supply the nutrient. ""One of the only reasons people prefer milk is that it is going to help build strong bones,"" says Dr Neal Barnard, president of the PCRM. But milk may not be the best way to get calcium your body needs. Of course, calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth, but there are other things that affect your bone strength, such as genes, how much vitamin D you take in, and getting an hour's worth of exercise every day. Some people disagree with the idea that milk isn't important. Keri Gans, an American Dietitian, says ""I don't think it's irresponsible to take this beverage that children enjoy it very much, especially among those who are unable to meet their nutrient needs for the day, and remove it from the lunch line."" The U.S government is now considering the request of the PCRM, but a decision may be a long way off. Meanwhile, Marion Nestle, a professor puts it best: ""Milk certainly has nutrients. Other food has the same nutrients. It's just food. As with other food, too much might be a problem."""	['drinking milk is not the best way to get the calcium your body needs']

Which of the following about the fight-or-flight response is true?	"A Charlotte, N.C., man was charged with first-degree murder of a 79-year-old woman whom police said he scared to death. In an attempt to evade policemen after a bank robbery, the Associated Press reports that 20-year-old Larry Whitfield broke into the home of Mary Parnell. Police say he didn't touch Parnell but that she died after suffering a heart attack that was caused by terror. Can the guy be held responsible for the woman's death? Prosecutors said that he can under the state's murder rule, which allows someone to be charged with murder if he or she causes another person's death while committing or fleeing from a severe crime like robbery--even if he or she doesn't kill someone on purpose. But, medically speaking, can someone actually be frightened to death? We asked Martin Samuels, chairman of the neurology department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Absolutely, no question about it. The body has a natural protective method called the fight-or-flight response , which was originally described by Walter Cannon,the chairman of Harvard University's physiology department from 1906 to 1942. If, in the wild, an animal is faced with a life-threatening situation, the autonomic nervous system responds by increasing heart rate, increasing blood flow to the muscles, and slowing digestion, among other things. All of this increases the chances of succeeding in a fight or running away from an aggressive beast. This process certainly would be of help to primitive humans. However, in the modern world there is obvious decline of the fight-or-flight response. The autonomic nervous system uses the chemical messenger to send signals to various parts of the body to activate the fight-or-flight response. This chemical is toxic in large amounts; it damages the organs such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. It is believed that almost all sudden deaths are caused by damage to the heart. There is almost no other organ that would fail so fast as to cause sudden death. Kidney failure, liver failure, those things don't kill you suddenly. By the way, any strong positive or negative emotions such as happiness or sadness can cause the same result. There are people who have died in intercourse or in religious passion. There was a case of a golfer who hit a hole in one, turned to his partner and said, ""I can die now"", and then he dropped dead. For about seven days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon there was an increase of sudden cardiac death among New Yorkers."

We could see from the passage that the mouse was _ .	"A mouse looked through a crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package: What food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap! Retreating to the farmyard, the mouse declared the warning, ""There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house."" The chicken clucked and scratched, raised her head and said, ""Mr Mouse, I can tell you this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me, I cannot be bothered by it."" The mouse turned to the pig and told him, ""There is a mouse trap in the house."" ""I am so sorry, Mr Mouse,"" sympathized the pig, ""but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; be assured that you are in my prayers."" The mouse turned to the cow, who replied, ""A mouse trap, am I in grave danger, huh?"" So the mouse returned to the house, head down and depressed to face the farmer's mouse trap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house, like the sound of a mouse trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was an evil snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever. Now everyone knew to treat a fever with fresh chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's main _ . His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig.

_ are not accessible to the Combination Room in Cambridge university without a lift. [ ]	"How many historic churches, pubs or buildings are there in your city? Are there worth preserving? Or are they just a waste of space? There are arguments for and against spending money on historic buildings. Dangerous staircases. Uneven floors. A lack of IT infrastructure. The problem with many old buildings is that they're... old - and extremely expensive to modernize. Take the case of the Combination Room in Cambridge University. It was built in 1347 and was initially used for lectures. Later, it became the Regent House - the university's parliament. It's of enormous historical value and cultural interest. However, it doesn't meet accessibility standards for disabled people. As a result, a lift needs to be installed, but not everyone is happy about this. ""Noting will persuade me that this lift would not in its effect, be a substantial alteration to the most precious room in the university. It would destroy the symmetry of that beautiful room,"" said one user. In general, modern buildings don't have this type of problem. They can be built according to the latest environment standards, with draught proofing and insulation to help reduce carbon emission and save energy. They can also be made wheelchair accessible, and they can be designed to ensure maximum comfort and space. Anyone who's been to a modern cinema, theatre or concert hall recently may understand the difference between the new buildings and older ones, which tend to have smaller seats, less space and poorer acoustics. Very often, there's money to be made by knocking down old building... especially if they're in city centers. So, the biggest threat to many historic buildings comes from developers. One of Croydon's oldest pubs, The Rose and Crown, is a perfect example of this. A property development company has recently been granted permission to convert the 18th century building into flats, much to the disappointment of many local residents. ""The bar is full of unique features and perfect examples of a traditional London pub. It really would be truly tragic for this Grade II listed building to be turned into soulless flats,"" said a spokesperson for English heritage. So, are these buildings really worth preserving?

Which of the following statements is INCORRECT?	Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way. As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist. Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it. Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify. Finally, life could evolve only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away. If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out. This process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which earthlike life might be found. However, even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, there are so many billions of planets that this would still leave a vast number on which life could exist.

Which of the following is TRUE of the CK 12 Foundation?	"California has a new program called the Digital Textbook Initiative. ""Starting this fall with high school math and science, we will be the first state in the nation to provide schools with a state-approved list of digital textbooks."" That was Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in June, talking about his effort to get schools to use materials available free online. He listed reasons why he thinks digital textbooks make sense. California approves traditional textbooks in six-year cycles. Digital ones can offer the latest information. They lighten the load of school bags. They save paper and trees, and make learning more fun and interactive. And above all, he said, they help schools with their finances. The state has had to make severe cuts in school spending because of deep financial problems. More than six million students attend California public schools. Earlier this year, California invited content developers to offer digital math and science materials for high schools. These had to meet at least 90% of the state's learning requirements. Specially trained teachers examined 16 textbooks and approved ten of them. Six of the ten were published by the CK 12 Foundation, a nonprofit group that had been developing digital science and math books for about two years. The foundation paid teachers and other education professionals to write and edit them. The money came from a group financed by the Khosla Family. California cannot require schools to use the digital textbooks. Individual school districts will have to decide for themselves. Susan Martimo, a California Department of Education official, says she does not expect widespread use right away. Her best guess is that some schools with a lot of technology will be the first to use them, but only in addition to their traditional books. School administrators point out that the texts may be free online, but students need a way to access them. Not everyone has a computer or electronic reader. Schools could print out copies, but that would not help the environment. Also, there is the cost to train teachers to use digital textbooks effectively."

When the writer's mother received the doll that she had waited so long, she was _ .	"Alice's mother died when Alice was five years old. Alice, who grew up to be my mother, told me that after her mother's death her family was too poor to even afford to give her a doll. In December 2012, I had a job at a local bank. One afternoon, we were decorating the tree in the bank lobby . One of my customers approached me with her beautiful handmade dolls. I decided to get one for my daughter, Katie, who was almost five years old. Then I had an idea. I asked my customer if she could make me a special doll for my mother--one with gray hair and spectacles : a grandmother doll. And she gladly agreed. A friend had told me that his dad who played Santa Claus would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home to deliver my Katie her presents, so I made some special arrangements. Christmas Day arrived and at the planned time; so did Santa Claus. Katie was surprised that Santa had come to see her at her own house. As Santa turned to leave, he looked once more into his bag and found one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, surprised at her name being called, indicated that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift, with a message card that read: For Alice: I was cleaning out my sleigh before my trip this year and came across this package that was supposed to be delivered on December 25,1953. The present inside has aged, but I felt that you might still wish to have it. Many apologies for the lateness of the gift. Love, Santa Claus My mother's reaction was one of the most deeply emotional scenes I have ever seen. She couldn't speak but only held the doll she had waited fifty-nine years to receive as tears of joy ran down her cheeks. That doll, given by ""Santa"", made my mother the happiest ""child"" that Christmas."	['happy and excited']
UNESCO helps the States Parties safeguard World Heritage properties by _ .	Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration. Places as unique and diverse as the wilds of East Africa's Serengeti, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Baroque cathedrals of Latin America make up our world's heritage. What makes the concept of World Heritage exceptional is its universal application. World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world, regardless of the territory on which they are located. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. UNESCO's World Heritage mission is to: encourage countries to sign the World Heritage Convention and to ensure the protection of their natural and cultural heritage; encourage States Parties to the Convention to nominate sites within their national territory for inclusion on the World Heritage List; encourage States Parties to establish management plans and set up reporting systems on the state of conservation of their World Heritage sites; help States Parties safeguard World Heritage properties by providing technical assistance and professional training; provide emergency assistance for World Heritage sites in immediate danger; support States Parties' public awareness-building activities for World Heritage conservation; encourage participation of the local population in the preservation of their cultural and natural heritage; encourage international cooperation in the conservation of our world's cultural and natural heritage.

Some women don't like to be offered a seat by men because _ .	"Body Language in the United States Most people shake hands and make eye contact when they meet people for the first time. Among very good friends, a woman may give another woman a little hug, and a man may kiss a woman quickly on the cheek. Males don't hug one another, which, however, is changing. Men usually shake hands with the right hand. Sometimes they use the left hand to either cover the handshake or lightly hold the other person's arm. This shows greater warmth and friendship. Most people wave hello or good -bye by extending the arm palm facing outward, and twisting the hand at the wrist. Another way is to raise the arm, palm outward, and move the whole arm and hand back and forth. This is important to know because in many other countries, the same movements mean ""no"". When people are waiting in a public place, such as the post office, they usually form lines. Some people get angry and complain if someone pushes their way into a line or jumps ahead of other people. Moreover, many women like men to open doors for them. They also like men to give up their seats on public transportation. However, some women do not like this type of behavior. They feel that men and women should be treated in the same way. In the United States, it's important to make direct eye contact in business and social situations. If you don't make eye contact, people will probably think that you are bored or not interested. If there is silence in these situations, people usually try to make conservation. Periods of silence make many people uncomfortable. People in the United States usually stand about one arm's length away from each other while talking or standing together. This space is called ""the comfort zone"". In the United States, mothers sometimes show that they are angry with children by shaking an index finger at them. People may show that they like children by patting them on the top of the head."	['they like to be treated equally']
The four blacks didn't leave the restaurant because _ .	"One afternoon, four black youths walked into a restaurant that served ""whites"" only. They sat down and ordered bread and milk. The white waiter just said ""We don't serve blacks"". The young men did not move. They were tired to death of segregation and of being kicked around. The manager was called. When he saw the angry look in their eyes, he said that he was sorry, but it was not possible to serve them. The next day, more young black people came, and even more came the day after to the restaurant. Then a gang of white youths came in and attacked them. Most of the blacks were beaten up and were black and blue all over. After that the police rushed in, the several people were put in prison---all of them were black, although they had not done anything wrong---just because they were black. The news spread quickly through the black living areas in the city. A large crowd held a meeting round the restaurant the following day, forcing the restaurant to shut. Young men, black and white, made speeches protesting against segregation and pointing out that black people only wanted to live a life in the same way that whites did. They gave out leaflets and soon the movement spread to other cities. Business became so bad at that particular restaurant that the owners were forced to give and served blacks. Nowadays, all the blacks are served in all restaurants open to the public in America."	['they were against segregation']

Why does the network aim to serve tourists especially from Europe and the USA?	"Here are four pieces of news from China Daily: SHANGHAI---The Huachen Group, which has put 83 million yuan in the development of the commerce market since its official registration late last year, recently held a meeting in Shanghai to show the use of its newly opened tourism business payment network. The network aims to serve tourists from all over the world, but especially from Europe and the United States where credit cards are popularly used. After opening the www.ehinaeonet.com website, netizens can get information about hotels and tourism services on tourism page. Hotels and services can be reserved and payment made through credit cards. The network opened in February in Beijing. SYDNEY---The Sydney Olympic flame will travel underwater on Australia's Great Barrier Reef during the torch relay following a successful test. Scuba diver Wendy Craig, a marine biologist, will carry the torch on three-to-four-minute underwater journey at Agincourt Reef on June 27, creating Olympic history, organizers said yesterday. Burning at 2,000 degrees, the torch is expected to remain alight three meters underwater because of a special kind of technology which creates a ""fierce flame""--- too powerful to be drowned out by water. Charles Tegner, managing director of torch creator, said the flame would burn like a flame from oxygen-producing chemicals. BEIJING---The election of a new leader in Taiwan cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China. ""Taiwan Independence"" in whatever form will never be allowed, according to a statesman of China's central government. ""We should listen to what the new leader in Taiwan says and watch what he does. We will observe where he will lead Cross-Straits relations.

According to the research, college students usually use few words to take notes by hand in class because they _ .	"Many college students have given up taking class notes by hand. Instead, they type on computers. But scientists say that method is less helpful. If you need to remember something, write it. Writing notes by hand is much better for long-term memory of idea. So, turn off your computer if you want to remember something. Students who type notes on a keyboard often write down what the teacher says word-for-word. They may write without really thinking about what they are writing. These electronic notes contained more words. But scientists say it leads to "" _ ."" Transcription means to write down something exactly as you hear it. However, students taking notes by writing them, need to first process the information they hear. Then they record just the main parts. They use fewer words. This is because people usually write slower than they type. This kind of process leads to a deeper understanding. The scientists did a research. In the research, students listened to a teacher and then took a test. Some took notes by typing on a computer. The others took notes by writing them down. Both groups performed about the same in remembering facts. But students who typed their notes did much worse on conceptual questions. These questions required them to understand an idea. Also, scientists found that those who wrote their notes remembered conceptual information better a week later. Scientists believe that the students who took notes by writing them had a deeper understanding of ideas. Scientists know that students probably will still use their computers in class. But they suggest to take notes by hand on screens. They say this might be a good way between different schools."	['want to write fast']
The following factors may account for the phenomenon except _ .	"The rise of the so-called ""boomerang generation"" is revealed in official figures showing that almost one in five graduates in their late 20s now live with their parents. By contrast, only one in eight university graduates had failed to fly the nest by the same age 20 years ago. It also found that grown-up sons are twice as likely as their sisters to still be living with their parents in their late 20s. With nearly a quarter of men approaching 30 still living at home, the findings are bound to lead to claims of a ""generation of mummy's boys"". Young professionals in their late 20s or early 30s have been nicknamed the ""boomerang generation"" because of the trend toward returning to the family home having initially left to study. Recent research has suggested that young people in Britain are twice as likely to choose to live with their parents in their late 20s than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. Growing housing prices, rising student debts and the effects of recession on the job market have forced a wave of young people to move back into the family home at an age when they would normally be moving out. But commentators warned that the phenomenon may have more to do with young people facing "" _ "" prospects than simply a desire to save money. While the proportion of those of university or college age moving out from the family home has continued to rise in the last 20 years, among those in their mid and late 20s the trend has been reversed. Overall 1.7 million people aged from 22 to 29 now share a roof with their parents, including more than 760,000 in their late 20s. In 1988, 22.7 per cent of men aged 25 to 29 were still living with their parents but last year the proportion was 24.5 per cent."	['that parents can help them more']

Which of the following is true?	A lift is wonderful. It is really only a small room. Rooms usually stay in one place. Lifts travel up and down all day long. Sometimes a worker stands in the lift. He or she operates it up and down. In modern lifts there is no worker. The people walk in. They know what floor they want. They push a button and the lift goes to that floor. It is all very fast and easy. Lifts are very important to us. Why? Think about a tall building. Maybe it has twenty floors. Maybe it has fifty or more. Who can walk up all the stairs? Maybe people can climb them one time. Can someone climb thirty floors to an office every day? Can small children walk up to their room on the twenty-fourth floor? Can their mother and father carry food up all those stairs? Of course not. We can have high buildings because we have lifts. We could not have all the beautiful tall buildings in the world without lifts. They are really wonderful.	['A modern lift can go up and down with no worker in it.']

It can be learned from the passage that gun-dogs are dogs that_.	"The dog, called Prince, was an intelligent animal and a slave to Williams.

When Williams wanted to put on his boots, he would murmur. ""Boots"" and within seconds the dog would drop them at his feet. At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco. A trained gun-dog, Prince had a large soft mouth specially evolved (;) for the sake of carrying hunted creatures, so the paper and tobacco came to no harm, never even showing a tooth mark. Williams was an engine driver, and he had to work at irregular times -- ""days"", ""late days"", or ""nights"". Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too. A curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds. The house was turned upside down in the search, but the wallet was not found. However, two days later, Prince dropped the wallet into Williams' hand. Very muddy, and wet through, the wallet still contained fifty-three pounds."	['can carry birds , foxes , etc .without hurting them']
Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because _ .	"The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition."" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea."

""And a teen's sense of self and values may be changed in a world where personal connections can be limitless,"" said Sherry Turkle . Another researcher , Robert Kraut , said he's worried about the ""opportunity costs"" of so much online time for youths . He found that teens who used computers, even just a few hours a week, showed increased signs of loneliness and social isolation. ""Chatting online may be better than watching television , but it's worse than hanging out with real friends,"" he said . Today's teens, however, don't see anything strange in the fact that the computer takes up a central place in their social lives. ""School is busy and full of pressure. There's almost no time to just hang out,"" said Parker Rice, 17. ""Talking online is just catch-up time."" Teens say they feel good about what they say online or taking the time to think about a reply.

To remember 11 numbers is not difficult. However, because of the smartphone, many of us are losing this ability. What's more, smartphones weaken our skills at giving directions, as well as killing face-to-face communications.

We can infer from this passage that the author _ .	"Mr. Sankaram, a physics teacher, was known for his antics in his classroom to make the dull lessons in physics lively and interesting. Mixing different chemical drugs in the lab to become new substances in chemistry makes students excited. While studying botany or zoology, students can visit a garden or zoo. But physics limits students to listening to the boring lectures which are hard to understand. For example, why an apple dropping from a tree travels downwards but not upwards. But Mr. Sankaram's classroom antics to cause students to listen to topics such as how sound travels in air or why light travels faster than sound made him stand out from the rest of the teachers. At that time, most students in our school attended the college to please their parents, and some parents were proud of their children for simply attending a college, no-matter whether they benefited or not. They didn't study hard. But a few students were diligent and they wanted to study pre-medical courses to gain admission into the medical school. The schooling of pre-medical courses was very expensive. The college was next to the medical school. The wall separating them was about four feet high. Few tried to jump over the wall to get free pre-medical courses. Doing this was at risk of injuries and the climbing was forbidden. The college where Mr. Sankaram taught was known for unruly and naughty students. The unruly students usually sat at the back of the classroom. When a student from the back of the classroom tried to disrupt the class, Mr. Sankaram would say, ""Dare you go ahead to make noise? Can you jump over the four-foot wall to get into the medical school?"" The student's face went red and he became silent. In the physics class . I sat in the first row to escape from the troublemakers at the back. One day during the class. Mr. Sankaram unexpectedly asked me, ""Can you jump over the four-foot wall?"" I shook my head and answered, ""No, sir, I couldn't jump over a one-foot wall, let alone a four-foot wall."" Mr. Sankaram wasn't satisfied with my reply but waved his hand for me to sit down. He looked at me in the eyes hard and said, ""If you can. Believe in yourself!"" There were stories about Mr. Sankaram's past history. As a student at same college years ago, he went into much depression for some time when he couldn't get into the medical school. In fact he could have been admitted by the school by his ability of studying. Because his family couldn't afford his pre-medical courses and he didn't dare to climb the wall, he often walked back and forth along the four-foot wall talking to himself and sometimes cried over his failure. Whether this story was true or false it was passed on from year to year. So Mr. Sankaram had a nickname ""four-foot."" It was true that he left his dream to his students and he began challenging the students' ability to jump over the four-foot wall to get into the medical school. As a student I failed at my attempt to get admission into the medical school. In fact not all students wanted to be a doctor. And years later I ended up as a chemistry teacher at the same college. I thank Mr. Sankaram for his encouragement to me, and I am determined to follow his example to make my class interesting. Mr. Sankaram passed away years ago. He will always be remembered for his wonderful teaching techniques such as dancing movements and his encouraging words."	['is a good teacher in the college where he once studied']

Kawasaki Heavy Industries was duly appointed the manufacturer and the first high speed train went ""on line"" in 1964. The Shinkansen, as is known in Japan, made its first journey between her capital and Osaka, a distance of 301 miles, at a speed of 132 mph. The next country to introduce high speed trains was France. SNGF, the public rail system in France, was losing passengers to other forms of transport and introduced the ""TGV"" (Train a Grande Vitesse) to counteract the trend in 1981. As a result of Opec controlling the oil market in 1974, the train was designed to be powered by gas turbines. It ran on a specially built track between Lyon and Paris. Eight years later another TGV was introduced, this time between the coast and Paris. Soon, France became the most rail efficient country in the world with high speed train connections to Belgium, London, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands. There was another positive element that resulted from the introduction of high speed trains. Between 1964 and 1991, Japan's Shinkansen had transported in excess of three billion passengers without there being a single fatal accident and eleven years after France introduced the TGV, it still had a 100% safety record. This statistic has never been equaled by the traditional slow moving trains in any country. China has become the fourth country to produce such trains, after France, Germany and Japan. China's first domestically produced bullet train with a maximum speed of 350 kilometers per hour has rolled off the production line. Equipped with highly-efficient power system, the currently fastest train in China is also energy efficient. When the train is running, it can transfer kinetic energy into electricity, so that it can ensure its electricity supply even when it is cut off from the power grids. In all, such trains are expected to be in commercial operation by the end of 2010."	['Fast and safe.']

A baby who has a depressed mother _ .	"It's not just adults who have a thing or two to discuss with other people, babies too have their own social lives and enjoy group interaction, according to a world-first study. The breakthrough study conducted by psychologist Professor Ben Bradley, at Charles Sturt University, could completely transform the way child-care centres are set up. In their study, the researchers examined groups of nine-month-old babies in New South Wales and Britain. And they came across astounding results. It was found that infants had ""social brains"" and focused not just on their mothers but on social life in groups as well. ""They communicate with more than one baby at once, and show jealousy and generousness,"" said Professor Bradley. He added, ""They develop their own meanings through group interaction, they notice if a group member is behaving differently and they take on roles, such as leaders and followers."" ""A baby who has a depressed mother tends to be withdrawn ( ), but put that same baby in a group of its peers and they behave and interact like any other baby."" It was the first all-baby group study ever to be conducted. ""Most studies of babies concentrate on the infant-mother relationship, assuming that is the single foundation for mental health, but babies are constantly involved with groups of people other than their mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents and those taking care. Therefore, the mother-baby approach needs to be combined with a group approach,"" said Bradley. Phoebe Christison, a child-care worker at Camperdown Sunshine Bubs in Sydney's inner west, said she often noticed what appeared to be emotional attachments developed between toddlers. She said, ""Joel ( 10 months ) and Isabella ( 11 months ) always like to hold hands when they sit in their high chairs and eat. And babies definitely show jealousy. They push and touch each other, and copy what the other is doing."""	['also enjoys group interaction']
In the eyes of the author, a single-sex school would _ .	"Boy's schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art dance and music. Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity , the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to agree with a stereotype, a US study says. Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to agree with the ""boy code""of hiding their emotions to be a ""real man"". The report, presented at a conference of the International Boys'Schools Coalition in London attended by the heads of private and state schools, goes against _ that boys do better when taught alongside girls. Tony little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls. The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their females peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills. But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boy's learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia. Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with ""boy-focused""approaches such as themes and characters that interest them. Because boys generally have more acute(sharp)vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given ""hands-on""lessons where they are allowed to walk around. ""Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modern type in which violence and sexism are major themes"" James wrote. Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to agree with a stereotype that men should be ""masterful and in charge"" in relationships, ""In mixed schools boys feel forced to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means."" The study reported."	['encourage boys to express their emotions more freely']

Why does Tsinghua University enter the list of the best-looking campuses in the world?	"Forbes asked a panel of architects and campus designers to nominate their picks for the best-looking campuses in the world. These are their top choices. Kenyon College Gambier, Ohio, US Mike Evans, a principal at Norfolk, Va., design firm Hanbury Evans Wright Vlattas + Company, says to be beautiful a campus must have a ""signature campus space as a carrier of the campus brand."" At Kenyon College, that space is ""Middle Path,"" a 10-foot-wide footpath that serves as the Gothic hilltop campus' central artery. More than just a trail, it's a village green for the tight-knit campus community. Sergei Lobanov-Rostovsky, who teaches 17th-century poetry at Kenyon, says the college, both isolated and pastoral, is ""a small place to think big thoughts."" Oxford University Oxford, England Teaching within Oxford's stone walls dates as far back as the 11th century, and the school is considered a paradigm for all college campuses. With its labyrinth of quads, cloisters, and archways, it evokes elegance and tradition at every turn. ""Its monastic roots and the spectacular quality of its buildings make it an architectural wonderland,"" says David Mayernik, associate professor at Notre Dame's School of Architecture. Princeton University Princeton, N.J., US Princeton's style is pure Collegiate Gothic ; most of it executed in gray stone covered in, yes, ivy. As imposing as these old stone structures are, the campus keeps life on a ""human scale"" by preserving green spaces and walkability.Sinuous footpaths, archways, plazas - all are designed to inspire spontaneous discussion and learning. Scripps College Claremont, Calif., US The total plan of this women's college, founded in the 1920's, has always called for artistic connection between buildings and landscape. Together, architect Gordon Kaufmann, in collaboration with landscape architect Edward Huntsman-Trout, created a distinctively Southern Californian blend of Mission Revival-inspired architecture and landscape, which is lovely, evocative and intact. An expert in deciduous trees, Trout planted rows of liquid amber trees to give the students ""a sense of autumn"" come fall. He also peppered the campus with tulip trees, sycamores, almond and orange trees, as well as rare shrubs. Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., US New additions like the Science and Engineering Quad manage to gracefully blend modern and technological elements with the timeless, elegant aesthetics of the campus' early California Mission Revival architecture. The campus also scores big points for its dramatic entrance via Palm Drive, its romantic Spanish red-tile roofs and myriad patches of green. Tsinghua University Beijing, China Forbe's panel of architects says natural setting plays a big part in assessing a campus' beauty. In that regard, this campus is blessed: Founded in 1925, Tsinghua sits on the former site of the Qing Dynasty's royal gardens. Many of Beijing's most notable historical sites, like the Summer Palace, are close by. The campus is peppered with artificial ponds where stone benches and floating lotus blossoms inspire reflection."	['because its natural setting plays a big part.']
Which of the following is true about the film?	"What does the word""youth"" mean to you? Many define it as a precious time in their life when they are young ,when fun ,passion,and imagination seem limitless.But for most high school students,youth is a time of determination and willpower for achieving their goals. This is vividly shown in Mark of Youth,a movie that opened on Feb 5.Mark of Uouth tells the story of four Senior 3 students in a top high school in the days leading up to the national cooege entrance examination. Each character represents a differet type of student,ranging from the most mischievous to the most motvated .Like most teenagers ,they enjoy carefree moments and like to talk about their schoolmates.But the rension of the approaching exam,probably their first life-changing event,is common-they must memorize seemingly endless English words and Chinese poems,work through piles of aractice test papers,and improve their scores despite the increasing pressure. But life exists beyond campus.That the college entrance examination is coming up doesn't mean they can escape family changes,such as when one character's parents get divorced or another's father is arrested.Can these four young people handle their problems and eventually make it to their ideal universities despite their on -and -off campus stress? The story is set in Hubei Huanggang Middle School,known for its students'outstanding performances on the big exam.The four students are played by the actors who played in the reality shows Happy Boys and Happy Girls.HongKong actor Alex Fong plays their teacher. Students may look more fashionable in Mark of Youth than in real life,but it is the story about the final year of high school that many viewers relate to. ""The film is very inspiring,""said Senior 2 student Yao Lingqian,16,from Leshan Foreign Language School in Sichuan proveince.""A total commitment to hard work ,though it ca be lonely and no fun at all,will leave precious marks on my youth."" And for Senior 3 student Gao Jing ,the film has given her optiomism.""The characters taught me that what you score is not the only important thing.The way you approach the exam matters the most,""said the 17-year-old from Zhenping County No 1 High School in Nanyang,Henan province. ""The film really reflects senior 3students'life.""Zhang Ping ,a teacher from a senior high school in Qingdao,commented."

What does a regular(n.) at a local bar having more friends prove?	"Bars are very important in providing a place where people can meet and make friends. People who enjoy a drink in a local bar are happier and have more friends. They are more likely to be engaged in conversations in small community pubs, and social skills improve after a drink. Professor Robin Dunbar of Oxford University said, ""Friendship and communities are probably the two most important factors influencing our health and well-being. Making and maintaining friendships is something that has to be done in the real world. The digital world is simply no substitute(n.). Given the increasing tendency for our social life to be on the Internet rather than in real life, having relaxed, accessible places where people can meet old friends and make new ones becomes even more necessary."" Tim Page, chief executive of CAMRA, said, ""Bars offer a social environment to enjoy a drink with friends in a responsible community setting. The role of community bars in ensuring well-being cannot be overstated. For that reason, we all need to do what we can to ensure that everyone has a 'local' near to where they live or work."" Bars have long been part of British society and have played a key role in British social life since the 16thcentury. Bars came to represent the heart and soul of a community, providing both a place of entertainment and an engine for community bonding. In a world before the arrival of the motor car, the bar provided a venue in which people could get friendships and a sense of community. But the closing decades of the 20th century witnessed major changes in both the style of bars (for example, themed bars) and their numbers. As of 2015, the number of bars declines sharply, with bars continuing to close at an average rate of 29 a week."	['The importance of face-to-face communication.']
The self-help program for teenagers lasted _ .	"I used to hate my mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with me. Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life. About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there. On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called ""Chocolate or Toys"". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice. This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining . A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict and how much she hated her mother. ""I want a new mom,"" she cried. ""Unluckily, you can't have one,"" the leader replied. ""You have to accept the mother that you have."" This hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation."	['three days']
Some people don't want their names known because they are _ .	"Many people write to newspaper and magazines to express their opinions. Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are held responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game. ""People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,"" said social worker Ken Yip, ""and this is what is causing a lot of family problems."" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply. There are people who wish to remain anonymous for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he does not want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime. Name or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter if responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our own name that we honor what we say."	['unwilling to draw public attention']
What do we know about Clare Burley from the passage?	"Most summer camps for teens center around sports, or music and arts, or just for having fun. But some girls in the Washington suburb of Arlington County, Virginia, went to camp to get a taste of what its like to be a firefighter. This is not a typical summer camp. But Michelle Pawlaw is glad she signed up for it.""Getting to experience the fires hands-on is really cool and something that most people don't get to do,"" she said. Michelle and eight other teenage girls are participating in the three-day camp offered by the Arlington County Fire Department located just outside of Washington. ""The purpose is to try to get young women interested in considering the fire service as a career"" said firefighter Clare Burley, who is in charge of the program. The free of charge, overnight camp is designed to let the girls experience what firefighters do in the line of duty to protect the community. They take classes and learn how to climb the ladder on a fire truck, operate emergency tools and rescue on injured person. They also do their share of cleaning the firehouse and the equipment Firefighting is still a male-dominated service. Clare joined the department seven years ago, saying ""We do everything that the guys do to the same standarD.We are tested to the same standarD.We are expected to operate at the same standard."" Most of the girls say they had never thought about becoming a firefighter, but the camp was a great learning experience. ""I think it is definitely not a job that only men can do. Women can do it just as well as men can,"" said Michelle Pawlaw. 'I think I can help other people if they need help and know what to do in case I am at a fire myself,"" said Kayla Ehrlich. ""I think it's fantastic; I could consider taking it as a career some day."" said Monica Bartorsh. And, the girls say, by spending three days together, they also made new friends and had a lot of fun."	['She has served the department for 7 years']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"I grew up in Jamaica Plain, an urban community located on the outskirts of Boston, Massachusetts. In the 1940's it was a wholesome, specific little community. It was my home and I loved it there; back then I thought I would never leave. My best friend Rose and I used to collectively dream about raising a family of our own someday. We had it all planned out to live next door to one another. Our dream remained alive through grade school, high school, and even beyond. Rose was my maid of honor when I got married in 1953 to the love of my life, Dick. Even then she joked that she was just one perfect guy short of being married, thus bringing us closer to our dream. Meanwhile, Dick aspired to be an officer in the Marines and I fully supported his ambitions. I realized that he might be stationed far away from Jamaica Plain, but I told him I would relocate and adjust. The idea of experiencing new places together seemed somewhat romantic to me. So, in 1955, Dick was stationed in Alaska and we relocated. Rose was sad to see me leave, but wished me the best of luck. Rose and I remained in touch for a few years by regular phone call but after a while we lost track of one another. Back in the 1950's it was a lot more difficult to stay in touch with someone over a long distance, especially if you were relocating every few years. There were no email addresses or transferable phone number and directory lookup services were available at best. I thought of her several times over the years. Once in the mid 1960's ,when I was visiting the Greater Boston area, I tried to determine her whereabouts but my search turned up empty-handed. Jamaica Plain had changed drastically in the 10 years I was gone. A pretty obvious shift in income demographics was affecting my old neighborhood. My family had moved out of the area, as did many of the people I used to know. Rose was nowhere to be found. 52 years passed and we never spoke. I've since raised a family of five, all of whom now have families of their own, and Dick passed away a few years ago. Basically, a lifetime has passed. Now here I am at the doorstep to my 80th birthday and I receive a random phone call on an idle Wednesday afternoon. ""Hello?"" I said. ""Hi Natalie, it's Rose,"" the voice on the other end replied. ""It's been so long. I don't know if you remember me, but we used to be best friends in Jamaica Plain when we were kid"" she said. We haven't seen each other yet, but we have spent countless hours on the phone catching up on 52 years of our lives. The interesting thing is that even after 52 years of separation our personalities and interests are still extremely similar. We both share a passion for several hobbies that we each picked up independently several years after we lost touch with one another. It almost feels like we are picking up right where we left off, which is really strange considering the circumstances. Her husband passed away a few years ago as well, but she mailed me several photographs of her family that were taken over the years. It's so crazy, just looking at the photos and listening to her describe her family reminds me of my own; a reasonably large, healthy family. Part of me feels like we led fairly similar lives. I don't think the numerous similarities between our two lives are a coincidence either. I think it shows that we didn't just call each other best friend we truly were best friend and even now we can be best friends again. Real friends have two things in common: a compatible personality and a strong-willed character. The compatible personality is what initiates the connection between two people and a strong-willed character at both ends is what maintains the connection. If those two ingredients are present in a friendship, the friendship is for real, and can thus sustain the tests of time and prolonged absence without faltering."

We can learn from the article that the author's husband _ .

Thirty-some years of marriage can do that to a woman. Give a man pruning shears and electric trimmers and he will give new meaning to ""armed and dangerous."" One day earlier this year, my husband said that the crab apple tree was dead. ""Why do you think it is dead?"" I asked. ""Look at it. There's not a leaf on it."" ""There's not a leaf on anything. It's March,"" I said. ""It looked sick last fall and with this bitter winter we had, I'm convinced it's dead."" The truth is he's never liked the crab apple. Sure, it has beautiful blooms in the spring, but then it gets a disease, the leaves curl, and it drops those little apples that sit on the driveway. Each passing week he pronounced the tree dead. Eventually I began to believe him. Though he agreed it would be a regrettable loss, there was a twinkle in his eye. He armed himself a couple of weeks ago and began trimming. A branch here, a branch there, a small limb, then a large limb. I watched and then decided to check the wood on some of the branches closer to the trunk. I broke one off and saw green. The crab apple was not dead. It just hadn't had time to leaf out. The tree was now falling to one side, but it was not dead. I would have told him so, but he had moved on to a maple. Once the man starts, he can't stop. One trim leads to another. ""Please, stop!"" I called. He smiled and nodded, but he couldn't hear because he had started the hedge trimmers and was getting ready to fix a line of hedges. Zip , zip, zip. ""What do you think?"" he shouted. ""It's supposed to be a privacy hedge; now all that will be private are our ankles."" He started the trimmers again. ""Stop!"" I called, ""Come back!"" ""Why?"" he shouted. ""You're in the neighbor's yard."""	"[""nearly ruined their neighbor's garden""]"
Where is the passage extracted?	BEIJING - A research team led by Chinese scientists have discovered dietary modulation of gut microbiota can alleviate both genetic and simple obesity in children. The findings of the team, led by Zhao Liping with Shanghai Jiaotong University, Yin Aihua with the Guangdong province children's hospital, and Tang Huiru with Chinese Academy of Sciences, have been published on EBioMedicine, a renowned medical journal co-sponsored by Cell and The Lancet in July. The team identified bacterial genomes specifically for producing obesity-related metabolites , and said an improved gut microbiota can significantly help to treat genetic obesity such as Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Beginning in childhood, PWS affected kids develop an insatiable appetite, leading to chronic overeating and obesity. The scientists used a diet therapy with beneficial gut bacteria on trial patients and found considerable _ appetite, weight loss and improved health conditions on the patients. The paper concluded dysbiosis of gut microbiota is highly related with both genetic and simple obesity in children, implicating dietary modulation of gut microbiota a potentially effective treatment method.

From the passage, we learn that in the three cities _ .	"We humans live in different parts of the world, but we have the same ""mother"". She gives us everything we need in our daily life. She is our Mother Earth. April 22 is Earth Day. The theme of this year is ""Green Cities"". A green city is a healthy and pleasant place for people to live, according to the United Nations. A green city can get its energy from renewable sources like solar and wind power. Also, it is connected by clean public transportation. Moreover, a green city is made up of facilities that can save energy and reduce waste. Around the world, many cities and countries have done well to build themselves in a green way. Chicago is well known for its green roof program. These roofs are covered with plants. The plants get a great amount of rainwater. Later, the water evaporates to help make the air cool and clean. So far, there are about 360 green roofs in Chicago, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Curitiba, Brazil, has great transportation. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system in 1974. BRT runs on special lanes. This makes sure that buses are on time even in traffic jams. With the help of BRT, the city has the lowest level of air pollution in Brazil. Today, many other countries have copied BRT, including China and Mexico. Singapore is home to the first zero-energy building in Southeast Asia. Zero energy means a building is able to create more energy than it uses. Zero-energy buildings work with solar panels mainly on roofs. These panels can make electricity which powers the buildings. By 2030, Singapore plans to build 80 percent of its buildings like this."

What's the best title of the passage?	"China's Ministry of Culture has recommended 10 cyber games that are suitable for minors to play as part of its drive to purify the on-line environment for the young. The 10 cyber games were selected by the ministry's on-line games censorship committee from scores of games recommended by the Chinese public.l The games are all domestic products. They include five role playing games (RPG), four recreation and chess games, and one educational game, such as ""Warring States II Online,"" ""Rainbow Island Online,"" and ""Wonderlands of learning and games."" These games have made their way into the final recommendation list because they are considered ""healthy"" and can ""enhance intelligence,"" according to the ministry. The ministry hoped the list could serve a a guidance for parents to better direct their children in the winter vacation, which usually lasts nearly two months from January to February each year. This was the third time for the ministry to publish recommended cyber games list. The previous two were made public respectively in January 2006 and August 2005 with a total of 25 games inlisted. In the past few years, on- line games have become the favorite pastime of young people. However, it is argued that such social problems as game addiction, juvenile delinquency and perversion among minors by on-line violence and pornography have come from an inadequately regulated Internet. About 9.72 percent of Chinese netizens between the ages of 13 and 30 suffer Internet addiction, said a report issued last month by the China Youth Association for Network Development (CYAND). According to the China Internet Network Information Center (CINIC), the main Internet watchdog, China had 210million Internet users at the end of 2007 and its online population is on course to become the world's largest at the beginning of this year. Net users between 18 and 30 accounted for 49.9percent of the total users. Although the CINIC did not give the figure of those below 18, teenagers and youths have obviously taken up more than half of the total number of net users. And the number of users under age 18 increased rapidly last year, the CINIC noted."	"['Chinese authority lists 10 ""suitable"" E-games for teenagers.']"
What would the dogs do if they presented their paw alone?	"The Vienna-based researchers showed that dogs will stop doing a simple task when not rewarded if another dog, which continues to be rewarded, is present. The experiment consisted of taking pairs of dogs and getting them to present a paw for a reward.On giving this ""handshake"" the dogs received a piece of food.One of the dogs was then asked to shake hands, but received no food.The other dog continued to get the food when it was asked to perform the task. The dog without the reward quickly stopped doing the task, and showed signs of anger or stress when its partner was rewarded. To make sure that the experiment was really showing the interaction between the dogs rather than just the frustration of not being rewarded, a similar experiment was conducted where the dogs performed the task without the partner.Here they continued to present the paw for much longer. Dr Frederike Range from the University of Vienna says this shows that it was the presence of the rewarded partner that was the greater influence on their behaviour. ""The only difference is one gets food and the other doesn't, they are responding to being unequally rewarded."" she said. The researchers say this kind of behaviour, where one animal gets frustrated with what is happening with another, has only been observed in primates before. Studies with various types of monkeys and chimpanzees show they react not only to seeing their partners receiving rewards when they are not, but also to the type of reward. The dog study also looked at whether the type of reward made a difference.Dogs were given either bread or sausage, but seemed to react equally to either.Dr Range says this may be because they have been trained."

What is implied in this passage?	Your morning cup of coffee may start to taste even better after a major government study found that frequent coffee drinkers have a lower risk of dying from a variety of diseases, compared with people who drink little or no coffee. The report, published online in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, analyzed the coffee-drinking habits of more thatn 400,000 men and women from 50 to 71 years old, making it the largest-ever study of the relationship between coffee consumption and health. Previous studies have offered conflicting results on the benefits, or harm associated with regular coffee consumption. While coffee contains caffeine, which may temporarily increase heart rate and blood pressure in some people, coffee also contains hundreds of unique compounds that may do good to health. Further confusing much of the research into coffee is the fact that many coffee drinkers are also smokers, and it has been difficult to untangle the health effects of coffee and cigarettes. To learn more, researchers from the National Institutes of Health analyzed diet and health information collected from questionnaires filled out by 229,119 men and 173,141 women, who were members of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) between 1995 and 1996. They were followed until 2008, by which point 52,000 had died. As expected, the researchers found that the regular coffee drinkers in the group were also more likely to be smokers. They are more red meat and fewer fruits and vegetables, exercised less and drank more alcohol -- all behaviors associated with poor health. But once the researchers were able to separate the risks, the data showed that the more coffee a person consumed, the less likely he or she was to die from a number of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, infections and even injuries and accidents.

How did the author's mother encourage her three daughters to grow closer?	When I was a child, I was shocked at the idea that my sisters could be my best friends. Now, I wouldn't have it any other way. At the time, the idea of my two sisters being my closest friends seemed strange to me. We fought all the time over toys, food, attention, what to watch on television--you name it, and we quarreled about it at some point. How could my sisters be my best friends? They weren't the same age as I. We all had our own friends in school. My mother never let the three of us forget that sisters are lifelong friends. Her wish like most parents' was to give us something that she never had. Growing up as an only child, she longed for siblings. When she gave birth to three daughters, the fulfillment of her dream had only just begun. She had given each of us a gift and she wanted to make sure we did not take that gift for granted. She would frequently tell us how lucky we were. But there were other, more subtle ways that she encouraged us to grow closer. She never showed favoritism to one daughter over the other, as not to cause jealousy or bitterness between sisters. She constantly took us places together--skating, shopping and swimming, so that we developed common interests. And when we were teenagers, Mom always punished us equally, giving us yet another bonding experience. We didn't always get along beautifully and fought just like any other _ . But somewhere in between Mom's lectures, the family vacations and the shared memories, we realized that our mother was right. Today I share things with my sisters that I do with no one else. My sister Cindy and I ran the New York City Marathon together, side by side, even holding hands when we crossed the finish line. When my sister Karen got married, I was her maid of honor . Cindy and I traveled through Europe together and even shared an apartment for two years. The three of us trust each other with our greatest secrets. It was twenty-three years ago that my mother first asked me who my two best friends were. Today she doesn't have to. She already knows.	['She showed equal love to her daughters.']
The best title for the passage would probably be _ .	"Do you love the holidays, but hate the pounds that follow? You are not alone. Holidays are times for feasting and celebrating. Many people are worried about their weight. With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. Whether it is celebrating at the office party or sitting down for the traditional family dinner, regard eating as a time for tasting a variety of the foods. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy. Here are some tips for preventing weight gain and keeping physical fitness: Don't skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack. This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods. Control portions. Use a small plate (about 10 inches) and put aside the large ones that may encourage you to ""load up."" You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist. Once you have your ""tasting"" serving, move away from the buffet. Doing so will make it less tempting to be eating constantly as your appetite is inspired by the sight of food. Begin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables. Or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you feel full. Stick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk after a meal can help burn off extra calories. Avoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have a large amount of fat. Choose lean meats. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of dressing or butter."

In which year might Victoria be the British queen?	"People all over the world write to Big Ben. They even send birthday presents. Big Ben is not a person. It's a clock. Big Ben is the great clock hanging up in a tower of the parliament building. The people of London like to see Big Ben's four friendly faces. They like to hear the bell striking on the hour. Bong! Bong! Bong! Big Ben's story started in 1834. In that year the old parliament building was burned down. Its clock tower fell to the ground. There had to be a new building and a new clock. Plans were made. They called for a ""King of Clock, the biggest and the best in the world"". So the clock had to be big. And it had to keep very good time. In two years the big clock was made. Five more years went by before the clock tower was last finished. Then the four bells for the chimes were brought into the tower. And at last the big hour bell was put in place. It rang out for the first time on July 11, 1859. This great bell had to have a name. A meeting of parliament was called to pick one. ""This clock is the king of clocks,"" one man said. ""Let's call the bell the Queen of Bells."" ""Then why not Victoria?"" said another (Victoria was the British queen at that time). The talk about names went on and on. Then Benjamin Hall got up to speak. He was a big man. By this time they were all tired. Someone shouted, ""Why not call it Big Ben and be done with it?"" Everybody laughed, and the meeting was over. But it was called Big Ben from then on. Not just the bell but the whole clock."	['1863']

Which of the following is true?	"A young girl decided to study judo despite the fact that she had lost her left arm in a car accident. The girl began lessons with an old Japanese judo instructor. The girl was doing well. So she couldn't understand why, after three months of training, the instructor had taught her only one move. ""Instructor,"" the girl finally said, ""Shouldn't I be learning more moves?"" ""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,"" the instructor replied. Not quite understanding, but believing in her teacher, the girl kept training. Several months later, the instructor took the girl to her first tournament . Surprising herself, the girl easily won her first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, her opponent became impatient. The girl used her one move to win the match. Still amazed by her success, the girl was now in the finals. This time, her opponent was bigger, stronger and more experienced. For a while, the girl appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the girl might get hurt, the referee called a time-out . She was about to stop the match when the instructor intervened . ""No,"" the instructor insisted, ""Let her continue."" Soon after the match restarted, her opponent made an important mistake: she dropped her guard. Instantly, the girl used her move to defeat her opponent. The girl had won the match and the tournament. She was the champion. On the way home, the girl and her teacher reviewed every move in each match. Then the girl asked what was really on her mind. ""Instructor, how did I win the tournament with only one move?"" ""You won for two reasons,"" the teacher answered. ""First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm."""	"[""The girl's opponent in the last match thought little of her but finally lost the game""]"
Why did Hank and his friends often ask Amanda to umpire for them?	Amanda Clement grew up in Hudson, South Dakota. Baseball was always her favorite sport. Once in a while her brother Hank and his friends would let her play first base in their games. More often, however, they asked her to umpire for them, because they knew her calls would be fair and there would be no arguing. One day in 1904, Amanda and her mother traveled to Hawarden, Iowa, to watch Hank play for the home team against Hawarden. When they arrived at the ball field, two local teams were waiting to play a preliminary game. The umpire hadn't arrived, so Hank argued that the teams should let his sister serve as umpire. The players finally agreed. Amanda, then sixteen and standing five feet, ten inches tall, made perfect calls. She was so good that players for the main game asked her to umpire for them and even offered to pay her. Thus, at sixteen, Amanda Clement became the first paid female baseball umpire of all time. She is honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.	['Because she knew the rules well and was fair.']

To get a feel for what that means, Lee Ann takes us on a shopping trip in San Jose. First stop: The bank, where she got cash from the teller. From the bank, it's on to the drug store, where Jeannie got a candy bar for Lee Ann. Then Jeannie helped pay the cashier, and got change hack.

Why can an oPhone send odors according to the passage?	"Say you forgot about Valentine's Day, and it's too late to send someone some roses. Someday, you'll at least be able to send their odors . A Paris lab under the direction of David Edwards, Michigan Technological University alumnus, has created the oPhone, which will allow odors to be sent, by Bluetooth and smart phone attachments, to oPhones across the state, country or ocean, where the person who receive it can enjoy American Beauties or any other kinds of rose. It can be sent by email, tweet, or text. Edwards says the idea started with student designers in his class at Harvard, where he is a professor. Normally, he says, there's a clear end in sight, but with their project no one had a clue who was going to pay for the research or if there was even a market. With the early major buzz produced -- Wired Magazine, National Public Radio, and the British press -- Edwards is sure the market will come. ""We create odor profiles ,"" says Blake Armstrong, director of business communications at Vapor Communications, an organization operating out of Le Lab in Paris. ""We put that into the oChip that gives away that smell."" Edwards said that the original four chips that will come with the first oPhones can be combined into thousands of different odors -- produced for 20 to 30 seconds. In fact, Le Lab is working with Cafe Coutume, the premier coffee shop in Paris, using oPhones to create nice experiences. ""Imagine you are online and want to know what a particular brand of coffee would smell like,"" Edwards says. ""Or, you are in an actual long line waiting to order. You just tap on the oPhone and get the experience."" And there are other benefits. ""Fragrance houses, of course, culinary, travel, but also healthcare. ""A patient with brain damage had lost memory, and the oPhone can help bring that memory back. Improvements are already planned at the end of year--give phone to audience in 2015. ""The oPhone will finally be smaller. "" according to Armstrong."	['Because its chips can combines odors stored in the oPhone.']
Why was the writer in a hurry that day?	"I was in a rush as always, but this time it was for an important date I just couldn' t be late for! I found myself at a checkout counter behind an elderly woman seemingly in no hurry as she paid for her groceries. A PhD student with not a lot of money, I had hurried into the store to pick up some flowers. I was in a huge rush, thinking of my upcoming evening. I did not want to be late for this date. We were in Boston, a place not always known for small conversation between strangers. The woman stopped unloading her basket and looked up at me. She smiled. It was a nice smile --warm and reassuring -- and I returned her _ by smiling back. ""Must be a special lady, whoever it is that will be getting those beautiful flowers,"" she said. ""Yes, she' s special,"" I said, and then to my embarrassment, the words kept coming out. ""It' s only our second date,but somehow I am just having the feeling she's 'the one' ,""Jokingly, I added, ""The only problem is that I can' t figure out why she' d want to date a guy like me."" ""Well, I think she's very lucky to have a boyfriend who brings her such lovely flowers and who is obviously in love with her,"" the woman said. ""My husband used to bring me flowers every week -- even when times were tough and we didn' t have much money. Those were incredible days; he was very romantic and -- of course -- I miss him since he' s passed away."" I paid for my flowers as she was gathering up her groceries. There was no doubt in my mind as I walked up to her. I touched her on the shoulder and said, ""You were right, you know. These flowers are indeed for a very special lady."" I handed her the flowers and thanked her for such a nice conversation. It took her a moment to realize that I was giving her the flowers I had just purchased.""You have a wonderful evening,"" I said. I left her with a big smile and my heart warmed as I saw her smelling the beautiful flowers. I remember being slightly late for my date that night and telling my girlfriend the above story.

Before a child can speak, he must _ .	We each have a memory. That's why we can still remember things after a long time. Some people have very good memories and they can easily learn many things by heart, but some people can only remember things when they say or do them again and again. Many of the great men of the world have got surprising memories. A good memory is a great help in learning languages. Everybody learns his mother language when he is a small child. He hears the sounds, remembers them and then he learns to speak. Some children are living with their parents in foreign countries. They can learn two languages as easily as one because they hear, remember and speak two languages every day. In school it is not so easy to learn a foreign language because the pupils have so little time for it, and they are busy with other subjects, too. But your memory will become better and better when you do more and more exercises	['hear and remember the sounds']

Wide applications of deepwater wind power technology can _ .	According to the US government, wind farms off the Pacific coast could produce 900 gigawatts of electricity every year.Unfortunately, the water there is far too deep for even the tallest windmills to touch bottom.An experiment under way off the coast of Norway, however, could help put them anywhere. The project, called Hywind, is the world's first large-scale deepwater wind turbine .Although it uses a fairly standard 152-ton, 2.3-megawatt turbine, Hywind represents totally new technology.The turbine will be fixed 213 feet above the water on a floating spar, a technology Hywind's creator, the Norwegian company StatoilHydro, has developed recently.The steel spar, which is filled with stones and goes 328 feet below the sea surface, will be tied to the ocean floor by three cables ; these will keep the spar stable and prevent the turbine from moving up and down in the waves.Hywind's stability in the cold and rough sea would prove that even the deepest corners of the ocean are suitable for wind power.If all goes according to the plan, the turbine will start producing electricity six miles off the coast of southwestern Norway as early as September. To produce electricity on a large scale, a commercial wind farm will have to use bigger turbines than Hywind does, but it's difficult enough to balance such a large turbine so high on a floating spar in the middle of the ocean.To make that turbine heavier, the whole spar's center of gravity must be moved much closer to the ocean's surface.To do that, the company plans to design a new kind of wind turbine, one whose gearbox sits at sea level rather than behind the blades. Hywind is a test run, but the benefits for perfecting floating wind-farm technology could be extremely large.Out at sea, the wind is often stronger and steadier than close to shore, where all existing offshore windmills are planted.Deep-sea farms are invisible from land, which helps overcome the windmill-as-eyesore objection.If the technology catches on, it will open up vast areas of the planet's surface to one of the best low-carbon power sources available.

What did Mark's teacher think of the last question?	"Last summer, Mark became a middle school student. He took an English test in the first month. Mark was a good student and he worked hard.

Mark saw the woman some times. She was tall and her hair was dark. But Mark didn't talk with her and didn't know her first name. The test was over. Then one student asked the teacher, ""Is the last question very important in this test?"" ""Yes,"" said the teacher. ""In our life, we meet many hard-working people. They are important. You should care about them. You should smile at them or say 'hello' to them."" Mark never forgot that question. He also learned that woman's first name. It was Kathy."	['It was important.']
Female monkeys of this kind are chosen for the research most probably because they are _ .	"Everybody is happy as his pay rises. Yet pleasure at your own can disappear if you learn that a fellow worker has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he is known as being lazy, you might even be quite cross. Such behavior is regarded as ""all too human"", with the underlying belief that other animals would not be able to have this finely developed sense of sadness. But a study by Sarah Brosnan of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that _ , as well. The researchers studied the behaviors of some kind of female brown monkeys. They look smart. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food happily. Above all, like female human beings, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of ""goods and services"" than males. Such characteristics make them perfect subjects for Doctor Brosnan's study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for pieces of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate and connected rooms, so that each other could observe what the other is getting in return for its rock, they became quite different. In the world of monkeys,grapes are excellent goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was not willing to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either shook her own token at the researcher, or refused to accept the cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other room (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to bring about dissatisfaction in a female monkey. The researches suggest that these monkeys, like humans, are guided by social senses. In the wild, they are co-operative and group-living. Such co-operation is likely to be firm only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of anger when unfairly treated, it seems, are not the nature of human beings alone. Refusing a smaller reward completely makes these feelings clear to other animals of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness developed independently in monkeys and humans, or whether it comes from the common roots that they had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question."

What is the best title of the passage?	"BEIJING - President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia has enhanced bilateral strategic mutual trust and support, and expanded practical cooperation between the two countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told media on Sunday. Wang made the remarks while introducing to reporters travelling with the Chinese official delegation the fruits of Xi's first foreign trip as China's new head of state, which had taken him to Russia, Tanzania, South Africa, and the Republic of the Congo. In Russia, Xi and the Russian president Putin had spent eight hours together in meetings and exchanges that could be characterized as frank, practical and congenial, Wang said, adding the two leaders reached important _ on strategic coordination and set the direction and outlined key sectors for future cooperation. The two countries have made it clear that they will support each other in promoting their respective development and national renewal, safeguarding core interests, and independently choosing their own development paths and social and political systems, the foreign minister said. The two sides agreed that they will closely coordinate in international and regional affairs, uphold the principles of the UN Charter, and jointly promote democracy in international relations, he said. China and Russia, during the visit, also promoted their practical cooperation. During the visit,32 cooperation agreements signed by the two sides are dubbed(...,...)as the ""contracts of the century"" because they are enormous in value and cover a long period of time, he said.

What's the passage mainly about?	When many people see birds cleaning their feathers, . But, in reality, what they are doing is maintaining their wings, the instruments that they depend on for safe flight. If a bird's wings are not in perfect condition, the bird either won't be able to fly or won't be able to control its flight. That is why after a long flight and even throughout the day, you will see them cleaning their feathers. Most birds, if they get a chance, will take a bath at least once a day. They do this to get rid of the dust that has accumulated in their feathers throughout their flight s during the day. In dry or desert areas, birds will not always be able to find water in which to bath, but they still need to clean their feathers. What many birds will do is to take dust baths. They will roll around in dust until it covers their feathers. They will stand up, shaking the dust out, and then clean their feathers with their beaks as usual. Baths are important for another reason. During the course of the day and night, many parasites are attracted to birds. Bugs, mites, fleas and so on will try to reach birds and suck from their blood. Daily baths help to keep the parasites to a minimum. Some birds, especially those that spend a lot of time in or around water, have skin glands that produce oil. After bathing, these birds will squeeze the glands to spread the oil over their wings to keep them free of water. If you are a bird lover and have bird houses in your yard, it can be good to go to the extra step, providing a bird bath. Once the birds in your neighborhood discover it, you will be surprised at how popular it becomes as they periodically stop by to take their daily bath.	['Why baths matter so much to birds.']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Children at school need this type of memory on a daily basis for a variety of tasks, such as following teachers' instructions or remembering oral sentences. During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one of two simple tasks during which researchers checked to ask if the participants' minds were wandering. At the end, participants measured their working memory ability by remembering a series of letters with simple maths questions. Daniel, a psychologist in the United States, said that those with higher working memory ability reported ""more mind wandering during these simple tasks"", but their performance did not suffer. The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm previous research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple thoughts at the same time. Dr Smallwood,in Leipzig,Germany,said: ""What this study seems to suggest is that, when circumstances for the task aren't very difficult, people who have additional working memory resources arrange _ to think about things other than what they're doing. "" Working memory ability is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores, and also offers a window into the widespread, but not well understood, field of internally driven thoughts. Dr Smallwood added: ""Our results suggest the sorts of planning that people do quite often in daily life--when they are on the bus, when they are cycling to work, when they are in the shower--are probably supported by working memory."

From the passage we know that most parents still hope that in the future their children can take up _ .	"LONDON (Reuters Life!) ---- Forget about talking your children into considering life as a doctor or a teacher and start training them for the talent show. A survey of British parents showed the aspirations of their children are greatly different from what they dreamed about when considering who they wanted to be when they grew up. Although astronaut still remains fairly high on the list of careers kids dream about these days, others like doctor and teacher have been taken the place of by the desire to win good name and money as a sporting hero, pop star or actor. The parents of children aged 5 to 11 said the choice of lawyer had dropped by only one place on a top 10 list to sixth, while teacher had dropped to ninth from top in the last 25 or more years. The survey for British TV channel ""Watch"" found a great difference between the genders of today's young people when compared with their parents' dreams 25 years or more ago. Playing professional football, being an astronaut and joining the firefighting service topped the boys' choices, while girls are more likely to be dreaming of taking to the stage as a pop star or actress or joining the medical profession. When asked what they would like their children to do for a living, today's parents still like the academic professions , with law and medicine scoring highly, while being a boss came third. Parents also praised job happiness above wealth when it comes to their hopes for their children. Nearly 70 percent of the parents surveyed thought that they failed to follow their dreams when it came to their career, with 37 percent thinking it was caused by a lack of aspiration and not having the necessary conditions."

Sam has got _ .	I'm Sam. My hobby is playing chess --one of the greatest games in the world. My mom taught me how to play when I was 7. She beat me every time for the first year. But then on my eighth birthday, I won for the first time. I nearly always beat her from then on. It takes about a day to learn the rules . But if you want to be good, you have to practice for years. You don't need much to play chess--just a chess set and someone to play with. Chess sets can be quite cheap, or very expensive. Some people collect chess sets as a hobby, but some prefer playing. There is a chess club in our school, and we meet every week to play with each other. I'm the best player in the club, and the captain of the school chess team. This year we won the All English Schools' Championship , and I had to go up on stage in front of the whole school to collect the trophy . I'm saving up my money to buy a chess computer. It's very expensive, but very good for practice. In that way, I'll always have someone to play with. One day I will be the world chess champion . ,.	['a chess set']
Does everyone think computers are good for children?	We are already familiar with computers--computers work for us at home, in offices and in factories. But it is also true that many children today are using computers at schools before they can write. What does this mean for the future? Are these children lucky or not? Many people who do not know about computers think of them as machines that children play with. They worry that children do not learn from experience but just from pressing a button and that this is not good for them. They think that children are growing not knowing about the real world. But people who understand more about computers say that computers can be very good for children. A computer can help them to learn about the real world more quickly, to learn what they want to learn and think for themselves. And for the future, don't we need people who can think clearly, who know how to get information quickly and use it well? What do you think?	['No, not everyone thinks so.']
What is the author's attitude toward the Oxford University project ?	"When a big exam is coming up, you probably feel anxious about any wasted time and want to begin school as soon as you probably can. But tens of thousands of British high school students will soon be getting up later. They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results. Grades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities. The Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am). The project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are ""out of sync "" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning. ""We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,"" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. ""Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings."" Everyone follows a natural cycle of sleep and wakefulne ss. Biology has decided that teenagers go to sleep around midnight and don't feel fully awake until 9-10 am, according to scientists. That's two hours later than adults. And their body clocks stay like this until the age of around 21 for males, and 19 for females. ""Society provides school for learning, but the brain provides sleep. So we are exploring the possibility that if you delay the schools start time until 10 am, that will improve learning performance,"" said Epsie. The results could be positive, based on previous studies. An early study at the UK's Monkseaton High School in 2009 found that starting an hour later improved grades in core subjects by 19 percent. The Oxford project is expecting to publish the results in 2018. It's time to wait and see whether scientists will give us an excuse to get up late."	['Optimistic']
The text does NOT mention _ as a basis for volunteering.	Volunteering can help you deal with stress and problems, have more confidence, and introduce you to exciting new ideas and people. But what kind of volunteering should you do? Firstly, think about what you enjoy. What are you interested in? What do you want to be when you grow up? For example, if you love animals, you can volunteer to care for abandoned pets or injured wildlife. If you want to grow up to be a doctor or a nurse, you can look for a youth volunteer program at a local hospital. Secondly, think about what you're good at. What skills do you have? What kinds of jobs do you do best? Try to find a volunteer position that will let you make the most of your strengths and talents. For example, if you're a great speaker, then you could try educating others about a problem you care about. If you're a cook, you might find a way to help feed hungry people in your area. Thirdly, look for what your own community needs. What should be improved in your town, city, or school? What types of volunteer projects would do the most good? For example, if there are a lot of homeless people in your area, you could raise money to help them. If your town has empty areas filled with dirt or rubbish, you could organize or join a group to plant trees and flowers to make these areas more attractive. The problems of the world, or even just of your community, might seem gigantic. Some people might even feel like there's no point trying to do anything, since what they can contribute seems so small. But every person is important, and can do some good and make a difference. Like you!	['what one gets in return']
From the survey we know _ like fast food best.	A lot of people in the world eat fast food.When you go into a fast food shop, you can see many people are enjoying their meals there.But which country people like fast food best? Do you know? A survery says : The English people are the biggest fans of fast food in the world, but the French people are the least interested in fast meals. The survey of thirteen countries shows :45% of the English people say they can't live without fast food, because it's delicious.44% of Americans and 37% of Canadians say the same. The French people ,they have their own delicious and high-class _ , so thy don't like fast food.81% of them think it is not healthy, and 75% of the Japanese think so too. How about the Chinese? How often do you have hamburgers or fried chicken?Do you like Western fast food or Chinese food.The most important thing is to keep a healthy diet.	['the English']
Those who were against his ideas of Special English programs said _	Henry Loomis served as director of the Voice of America for seven years starting in 1958.Mr Loomis played an important role in creating the Special English service . Henry Loomis was born in 1919 Tuxedo Park , New York. His father was Alfred Lee Loomis , a rich New York City businessman .In 1940, Henry Loomis dropped out of Harvard University to join the United States Navy .He was able to put to good use his knowledge of radar technology that he had learned about because of his father's work .After graduating at the top in his naval training class, Henry Loomis became a teacher at the Navy's radar training school in Hawaii. By the end of World War Two, Henry Loomis had received many honors for his service, including a Bronze Star and an Air Medal. He left the Navy in 1946 to begin graduate studies. Henry Loomis later moved to Washington, D.C. to begin another part of his career in public service. He held positions in the Department of Defense and other agencies: In 1958, he became director of the Voice of America. During his travels around the world, Mr. Loomis saw that English was becoming an important international language. He believed that it was important to make English easier to understand by listeners of VOA broadcasts whose native language was not English. So Mr. Loomis asked VOA program manager Barry Zorthian to develop a way to broadcast to listeners with a limited knowledge of English: The result of this effort was Special English: The first Voice of America broadcast in Special English took place on October 19th, 1959. Those against his ideas at the time said the Special English method of broadcasting at a slower rate with a limited vocabulary would never work, it was not practical. American embassies demanded that the program be called off. But Mr. Loomis supported the program. Soon, VOA began to receive hundreds of letters from listeners praising the program. Special English programs became some of the most popular on VOA. We are pleased to say that our programs still are.	['Special English programs were not practical']

What makes each person different from anyone else except twins according to the passage?	While learning the science lessons, I used to get a doubt--why ear, nose, tongue and eyes should be called as special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we maintain contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connectivity. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a meal, but the hearing pitch does change after a heavy meal. We usually give credit of the taste to our tongue, but do you know that unless saliva dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something. Women are much better smellers than men. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly recognize the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different smells, which are strongly tied to the memories. Pupils do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a much delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can enlarge their pupils, change the focus and make their vision less clear. Each and every one of us has a particular or individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except the twins. This smell is very subtle yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this smell that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around.	['The particular smell of a person.']
From this passage, we know _ are football fans.	"Henry works in a factory. He comes from a poor family and was in school for only four years. He has to do the hard work, but he hasn't got much money. He likes to watch football matches very much and spends much time on it. One evening there was a big football match on a playground. He borrowed some money from his friend and hurried there. There were a lot of people there. And all the tickets were sold out. He was sorry for it. He saw a pole outside the playground and climbed up it quickly. A policeman came and said, ""It's dangerous to stay on it! Come down!"" ""Wait a minute, please!"" Henry said and just at that moment the policeman heard cheers in the playground and asked in a hurry, ""Which team has kicked a goal?"" ""Ours!"" ""Wonderful! You can stay there. But take care!"" the policeman said happily and left. When the match was nearly over, he came again and asked, ""Who's won?"" ""Theirs, 3:2."" ""Come down,"" said the policeman angrily. ""Such a match isn't worth watching!"" Henry had to come down. But soon they heard cheers again. The policeman said anxiously, ""Climb up and quickly and see who's kicked a goal!"""

The main reason why people fail to act when they stay together is that _ .	Thirty-two people watched kitty Genovese being killed right beneath their windows. She was their neighbor. Yet none of the 32 helped her. Not one even called the police. Was this in gunman cruelty? Was it lack of feeling about one's fellow man? Not so, say scientists John Barley and Bib Fatane. These men went beyond the headlines to probe the reasons why people didn't act. They found that a person has to go through two steps before he can help. First he has to notice that is an emergency . Suppose you see a middle-aged man fall to the side-walk. Is he having a heart attack? Is he in a coma from diabetes ? Or is he about to sleep off a drunk? Is the smoke coming into the room from a leak in the air conditioning? Is it steam pipes? Or is it really smoke from a fire? It's not always easy to tell if you are faced with a real emergency. Second, and more important, the person faced with an emergency must feel personally responsible. He must feel that he must help, or the person won't get the help he needs. The researchers found that a lot depends on how many people are around. They had college students in to be tested. Some came alone. Some came with one or two others. And some came in large groups. The receptionist started them off on the tests. Then she went into the next room. A curtain divided the testing room and the room into which she went. Soon the students heard a scream, the noise of file cabinets falling and a cry for help. All of this had been pre-recorded on a tape-recorder. Eight out of ten of the students taking the test alone acted to help. Of the students in pairs, only two out of ten helped. Of the students in groups, none helped. In other words, in a group, Americans often fail to act. They feel that others will act. They, themselves, needn't. They do not feel any direct responsibility. Are people bothered by situations where people are in trouble? Yes. Scientists found that the people were emotional, they sweated, they had trembling hands. They felt the other person's trouble. But they did not act. They were in a group. Their actions were shaped by the actions of those they were with.	['they do not have any direct responsibility for those who need help']
"The best title of the passage is "" _ ""."	"Jim was a 15-year-old boy living with his little sister, Joy. Their parents had passed away long ago. Jim took care of Joy by himself. One day, Jim woke up at 3 in the morning as usual. When Joy was sleeping alone, Jim left their little house to deliver newspapers. As he did so, he found something unusual. One man was sitting in front of Jim's house. Jim was so surprised that he stopped to look at him closely. It was an icy morning and he looked very old. The poor old man didn't have anything to cover himself with. Jim went into his house to get the old man a blanket . However, there were no extra blankets, so Jim thought hard and took his father's coat. It was the only thing of his father's that he had left. Jim wrote a short note. ""Sir, I found you sleeping in front of my house. This is my father's coat. I hope it fits you well."" He put the note in a pocket of the coat, and covered the old man with the coat. Then he went to work. When he came back three hours later, both the man and the coat were gone. Jim thought that it was the best thing he could have done with his father's coat. That afternoon, Jim hurried home after school because Joy was at home alone. However, Joy and the old man were standing in front of the house, and Joy shouted to Jim, ""Brother!He's our grandfather!"" The grandfather smiled and said, ""Jim, I have been looking for you all around the country for eight years. I'm not rich. But I can take care of you two. Thank you for giving me the coat and letting me know what a good person my grandson is. This coat was the very one that I gave my own son, a long time ago."""	"[""Father's coat""]"
What can we learn about Decio?	If you are a fruit grower--or would like to become one--take advantage of Apple Day to see what's around. It's called Apple Day but in practice it's more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but sinceit has caught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain. Visiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn't taste of anything special, it's still worth a try, as is the knobbly Cat's Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else. There are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you'll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it's _ for most apple lovers who fall for it. At the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games. Apple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards .If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.

Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	"What would you do if your pet cat died just before Christmas? Many cat lovers would go out and buy another cat. But one American woman was unable to bear life without her much loved pet cat Nicky. He had been with her for 17 years; and when she knew he was going to die, she had him cloned. Little Nicky was cloned by an American company, called GSC. But the new cat cost his owner $50,000. ""He is the same. His characteristics are the same,"" the woman told news reporters. The company, Sausalito-based Genetic Savings and Clone, made her available to speak to reporters only on condition that her name or hometown was not used. The woman said she feared being the target of groups against cloning. ""Nicky loved water, which is an unusual characteristic of cats. Little Nicky jumped into my bath. Most cats are afraid of water, but Little Nicky is different: he loves it, just like my old cat,"" said the woman, who said she was in her early 40s and worked in the airline industry. The company delivered Little Nicky two weeks ago and was expected to publicly announce the news on Thursday. However, the cat's creation has raised heated debate. Many people have said they felt disgusted at the amount of money spent on cloning a cat. They said that she should have chosen one of the many cats without a home -- cats like this are a common problem in many countries. The woman has only told news reporters her first name, Julia, but she has already received nearly 100 frightening letters from angry people, who say that cloning is against nature. Little Nicky was not only expensive, but also, like all cloned animals, may have more health problems than an animal which was born in the usual way. GSC said it had to try 80 times before it succeeded in producing a cloned cat. The company is now using new techniques and soon they hope to produce cloned dogs as well as cats. GSC said that if people were not happy with the cloned cats or dogs, they could have their money back. At the moment the cost of cloning is very high, but the manager of CSC said he hoped that eventually it would go down, and that in five years, the cost should be $20,000 for a dog or $10,000 for a cat."	"[""People could get the money back if they aren't satisfied with the cloned pets.""]"

Which statement is compared by Mr. Last to the change from monkeys to apes, and apes to humans?	"By 2050, a completely new type of human evolve as a result of extremely new technology, behavior, and natural selection. This is according to Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute, who claims mankind is undergoing a major ""evolutionary transition"". In less than four decades, Mr. Last claims we will live longer, have children in old age and rely on artificial intelligence to do ordinary and boring tasks. This shift is so significant, he claims, it is comparable to the change from monkeys to apes, and apes to humans. ""Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,"" Mr. Last says, who believes we will spend much of our time living in virtual reality. Some evolutionary scientists believe this age could be as high as 120 by 2050. Mr. Last claims humans will also demonstrate _ , according to a report by Christina Sterbenz inBusiness Insider. This refers to something known as life history theory which attempts to explain how natural selection shapes key events in a creature's life, such as reproduction. It suggests that as brain sizes increase, organisms need more energy and time to reach their full potential, and so reproduce less. Instead of living fast and dying younger, Mr. Last believes humans will live slow and die old. ""Global society at the moment is a complete mess,"" he told MailOnline. ""But in crisis there is opportunity, and in apocalypse there can be transformation. So I think the next system humanity creates will be far more sophisticated, fair, and abundant than our current civilization."" ""I think our next system will be as different from the modern world, as our contemporary world is from the medieval world. The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,"" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology. The change is already happening. Today, the average age at which a woman in Britain has her first baby has been rising steadily stands at 29. 8. In the US, just one percent of first children were born to women over the age of 35 in 1970. By 2012, that figure rose to 15 percent. ""As countries become socio-economically advanced, more and more people, especially women have the option to engage in cultural reproduction,"" Mr. Last added. And as well as having more child-free years to enjoy leisure time, he believes artificial intelligence will make up the need for low-skill jobs. We may also spend a large amount of time living in virtual reality. ""I'm not quite sure most people have really absorbed the implications of this possibility,"" Mr. Last said. His views are detailed in a paper, titled ""Human Evolution, Life History Theory, and the End of Biological Reproduction"" published Current Aging Science."

She handed out sheets of paper shaped like giant ears. On his way home, Colin glared out of the school-bus window. Not fair, he thought. How could he collect enough sounds on his family's farm? If only he lived in the town. He got off the bus when it stopped at his mailbox. But he wasn't in the mood to wave as it drove away. ""I'm home!""Colin called when he pushed open the gate.

In the chicken house, Colin hurried two hens from their nests.He put their warm eggs into his jacket. The black cow napped in the sun. Colin woke her when he poured corn into her pan. ""Moo, thank you!""she seemed to say. Colin put the eggs in the kitchen, then climbed to his tree house as usual. He could see Dad's beehives by the field. Six hives usually meant plenty of humming noise. But today he couldn't hear it over the chattering sound of the sparrows,How could a person think? ""QUIET!""Colin shouted. Suddenly, he sat up straight. Cows mooed and young dogs yipped. Chickens crackled in their yard. When Astrid began woofing below, Colin smiled broadly. ""I hear you!""he called.

What do we know about the people who dedicated their lives to the cave before?	"Once upon a time, a man was walking on a mountain when he found an incredible cave with all kinds of treasure inside it. So he gave up his job, his home, and his friends, and spent all his time guarding the cave. He was so dedicated to it that he hardly ate or drank, and before long he fell ill. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he decided to share the treasure. He crawled into the cave to get a handful of jewels, but discovered, to his horror, that it was empty except for a small emerald . The man took it, and gave it to the first person he came by, a woman. Then an old man came by. ""What bad luck!"" the man said. ""Just a moment ago I gave a woman the last of the treasure I was guarding."" ""Are you sure there is nothing left?"" the old man asked. The man took him into the cave, where they found a chest with jewels and some bags of gold. The man was shocked, and the old man explained to him, ""At last! At last someone has broken the spell of this cave. This is the Cave of Treasure, and you're the first to have passed its great test. Many have dedicated their lives to this cave, only to end up realizing there was nothing here..."" ""And why does this happen?"" the man asked. ""This magic cave has only as many riches as your own heart. When someone discovers it, the cave is filled with treasure, but later, when they have devoted themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts empty, as does the cave. The only way to fill it is by filling your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving the woman that last jewel."" From that day on, the man understood that it was better to share than to keep. Thanks to the cave and the old man, he became noble and generous."	['They all found the cave empty at last.']
According to the passage, probably Gloria did the following excep _ .	"Singing had always been an important part of Gloria Estefan's life. ""Since I was three years old, I sang. I sang everything,"" Gloria said. ""Cubans,"" she added, ""are a musical people"". Gloria was born in Cuba in 1957. Her family left the country just before Fidel Castro came to power. In Miami, where the family settled, many people did not accept Cuban immigrants. In first grade, she spoke little English, but she worked hard to learn the language. Six months after she entered school, she won an award for reading in English! When Gloria was ten, her father returned from the Vietnam War. Soon, the family realized he wasn't well. They soon found out that he was badly ill. Her mother went back to teaching at school to support the family. Gloria cared for her father and her younger sister. She still made the honor roll, and she still had her music, but Gloria was lonely. However, when the band leader Emilio Estefan came to speak at her high school, Gloria sang for him. He asked her to join his band. It was the beginning of the Miami Sound Machine. Within a few months, the Miami Sound Machine was the top band in Miami. In 1978 Gloria and Emilio married. At first, the Miami Sound Machine was known only in Miami. Then the band signed with CBS Records. Estefan and his band became stars. Since then, the Miami Sound Machine has sold millions of records. Gloria has done more than just singing when Hurricane Andrew hit central Florida in 1992. She used only two weeks to organize an all-star concert that raised $2 million for the people who suffered in the hurricane. ""We needed a party after that _ ,"" she said. Gloria said, ""You have to stay true to the music you really love to do. There will always be people who will tell you, 'that won't work.' You've got to be firm in spite of difficulties. Stick to it--that's the main thing."""	['teaching at school to support the family']
The passage mainly tells us _ .	A blocked airway can kill someone in three to four minutes, but it can take more than eight minutes for an ambulance to arrive. So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger. There are many misconceptions surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do. You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes. The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives. Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt their head forwards and ask the person to pinch the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth. You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online. Remember: anyone can save a life	['some misunderstanding about first aid']

According to the research, the self-controlled people _ .	"Self-control can make you happier not only in the long-run, but also in the moment. The research showed that self-control isn't about giving up desires, but more about managing conflicting goals. Since most people consider highly self-controlled ones as being more task-centered, the scientists decided to find out the connection between self-control and people's happiness to determine if being self-disciplined leaves people feel less joyful. Through a set of tests-including one that assessed 414 middle-aged participants on self-control and another that randomly interviewed volunteers on their smart phones about their mood and any desires they might be experiencing, researchers found a strong connection between higher levels of self-control and satisfaction. The smart phone experiment also showed how self-control may improve mood. Those who showed the greatest self-control reported more good moods and fewer bad ones. But this didn't appear to be linked to being more able to resist temptation --it was because they exposed themselves to fewer situations that might inspire desires in the first place. They were doing a number of things that bring them happiness and avoiding problematic desires and conflicts. That became clear in the study's last experiment, which looked into how self-control affects the way people handle goals that conflict with one another. In particular, the researchers were interested in how self-disciplined and less-disciplined people differed when it came to choosing among ""virtues"" and ""vices"" like the pleasure of eating sugar cookie vs. the pain of gaining weight. Participants were asked to list three important goal conflicts they experienced regularly and were also questioned on how they managed to balance the goals. The highly self-controlled showed an obvious difference from those with less discipline over their lives. They tended to avoid creating situations in which their goals would conflict, and reported fewer instances of having to choose between short-term pleasure and long-term pain. As a result, they experienced fewer negative emotions. And self-control doesn't always mean _ : it may mean saving now to get big payoff later. For dieters, it means making choices to avoid entering a bakery since you are more likely to buy a cupcake. Granted, self-control isn't the best way to instant satisfaction, but it may bring something even better: long-term contentment."	['are better solving problems and conflicts']

Self-tracking was firstly come up with by _ .	"What Is Self-tracking All about Perhaps you've tracked how many kilometers you've run, how many hours you've slept or how much you've eaten in a day. If so, you've taken part in a popular movement called the ""Quantified Self Movement"" or ""Self-tracking"". Maybe you've wanted to change a bad habit but couldn't. Self-tracking may be your answer. The idea is to collect information about your everyday activities and analyze them to help improve and form a healthier lifestyle. Recently, tools such as smartphones, apps, along with newly published wearable things, are making self-tracking easy. Today, one can use Fitbit, the Jawbone Up, Google Glass or a smart watch to record personal data including sleeping hours, stress levels, heart rate and mood. So why does a person self-track? Someone may be trying to lose weight or improve their sleep. Another person feels tired after eating. Self-tracking could help him to know what foods make him sleepy and watch his diet. [:Z#xx#k.Com] Tracking daily activities isn't a new concept. In years past, athletes and their coaches kept notes food, training and sleep in order to achieve an athletic goal. Similarly, doctors have also helped patients to record parts of their lifestyles and eating habits to help fight health problems. However, it wasn't until 2007 that magazine writers Gary Wolf and Kim Kelly created the term ""Quantified Self"" or ""self-tracking"". Although self-tracking has many advantages, Dennis Nash, president of Data Speaks Health Solutions, says self-tracking has its disadvantages. Once people start tracking their daily activities, it can become an extra task people like to do often. Also, they might begin to worry too much about their health. Though self-tracking doesn't make sure that one's quality of life will improve, it can encourage people to make healthier choices."	['two magazine writers']
According to the passage, being a vegetarian helps _ .	I am a vegetarian . Many people are quick to think of vegetarianism as strange behavior. I treasure our Earth, and since we only have one, we should protect it and the wildlife that lives on it. But that's only one of the reasons to be a vegetarian. Vegetarians may live longer, healthier lives. There is a connection between red meat consumption and various diseases. From an economic standpoint, it requires less land, money and energy to produce foods for a vegetarian diet. While there are many benefits to being a vegetarian, only a handful of those who attempt to adopt this lifestyle succeed. The most important quality required to be a vegetarian is firmness since surrounded by the _ of meat, we tend to give up vegetarianism easily. Creativity is almost as important as commitment. It's easy to tire of eating nothing but salad. But with a little creativity and some soy products, almost any meal can become vegetarian-friendly. Not everyone wants to be vegetarian. Accepting this is part of being a vegetarian with style. Forcing your beliefs on others is disrespectful. Stylish vegetarians should also be able to turn down a meaty dish politely without annoying their hosts. Being a successful vegetarian has been easy for me, but it may not be so for others. A common mistake is quitting before your body has adjusted to the change. It can be difficult to keep the lifestyle in the beginning because of temptation. However, it fades over time. Another common mistake is quitting because you've been misinformed about the nutritional wisdom of being a vegetarian. That's why it is vital to be educated. Countless people will tell you that it's impossible to obtain the nutrients and protein your body requires without meat, but they are incorrect. People actually need only 44-55 grams of protein a day, and that is easily found in a vegetarian diet. Many meat eaters are consuming three times that amount, which is not beneficial. It leads to diseases. Vegetables can also supply all the vitamins, minerals and nutrients your body needs. However, if you're still not convinced, you can take a multi-vitamin.

How long should young boys and girls need to sleep a day?	"If you want to keep healthy, you should have good habits. What is a habit? It is something we do very often. We don't even think when we do it. It has become a part of our lives. ""Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."" This is an old English saying. Do you know what it means? It means that we must go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy, rich and clever. Is this true? Perhaps it is. We know the body must have enough sleep. Boys and girls need eight or nine hours' sleep every day. Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is a very bad habit. Then you will not think or do your work well. Of course, you can't be healthy, wealthy or wise. When we get up early in the morning, we can go out and do morning exercises. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running jumping, swimming, and playing ball games are all exercise. If we don't exercise, our body will become weak. Exercise helps the blood to move around inside our body. Blood takes food to all parts of our body. Our body also needs air to breathe. Without air, we will die. We must have lots of clean fresh air if we want to be healthy. That is why many people like to go out to do morning exercise."	['Eight hours or so.']

Which of the following description about Vancouver is NOT true according to the passage?	"Vancouver Natural Resources As a major centre for the global forestry industry, Vancouver is host to many international forestry conferences and events, and the natural home of the massive BC forestry business. Companies such as Canfor and West Fraser Timber Co., the second and third largest lumber producers in the world, are headquartered in Vancouver. Vancouver is also a major centre for the mining industry. International trade International trade is a key part for Vancouver's economy. The city has Canada's largest port and is one of North America's major gateways for Pan-Pacific trade. The Port of Vancouver ranks first in North America in total foreign exports and second on the West Coast in total goods volume. Banking and Financial The headquarters for HSBC Canada is located in the Financial District in downtown. Canada's third largest commercial entity , Jim Pattison Group is also based in Vancouver. International relation Vancouver is a major centre for diplomacy and foreign relations. Most countries of the world have consulate or general offices in the Central Business District. In fact, many major diplomatic conferences are hosted by the city - including the world famous G7 summit with President Clinton, APEC, and the World Trade Organization. Greenpeace has its world headquarters in the city. Therefore, Vancouver was among the first North American cities to declare itself a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone. Tourism Tourism is a leading industry to Vancouver. The Whistler-Blackcomb Resort is among the most popular skiing resorts in North America, and will be the site of the downhill events of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Vancouver's beaches, parks, waterfronts, and mountain backdrops and its multi- cultural character attract more and more tourists. Film Vancouver was the source of the sobriquet ""Hollywood North"", for hosting the production of about ten percent of Hollywood's movies. Many U.S. television and films series are shot exclusively in Vancouver. This has partly been because of the favourable Canadian dollar exchange rate."

Which of the following statements is NOT true?	Parents whose children show a special interest in a sport feel very difficult to make a decision about their children's careers. Should they allow their children to train to become top sportsmen and sportswomen? For many children it means starting schoolwork very young, and going out with friends and other interests have to take a second place. It's very difficult to explain to a young child why he or she has to train five hours a day, even at the weekend, when most of his or her friends are playing. Another problem is of course money. In many countries money for training is available from government for the very best young sportsmen and sportswomen. If this help can not be given, it means that it is the parents who have to find the time and the money to support their child's development and sports clothes, transport to competitions, special equipment, etc. All can be very expensive. Many parents are worried that it is dangerous to start serious training in a sport at an early age. Some doctors agree that young muscles may he damaged by training before they are properly developed. Professional trainers, however, believe that it is only by training when young that you can reach the top as a successful sports person. It is clear that very few people do reach the top, and both parents and children should be prepared for failure even after many years of training.	['Most children may become top sportsmen after a long period of training.']
That phone call on a summer day made the author very _ .	"It was a hot summer day. My dad and I were getting ready to go out for a ride on the boat. Just then the phone call came, the call changed that sunny and beautiful day into a cold and dark one. When I saw my father answering the phone, he was crying. I'd never seen my dad cry before. My heart sank. What possibly could happen? ""Max, I'm so sorry,"" I heard him say. That's when it hit me. I knew that Suzie had died. Max has been my dad's best friend for years. Suzie, his daughter, had a serious illness. She knew she was different from other kids. Although she couldn't live a normal life, she was still happy. When Suzie and I were little girls, we spent quite a bit of time together. When Suzie was ten, she had to live in a hospital. About eight months before she died, we talked at least twice a week on the phone until the end. Suzie was always so excited to talk to me and wanted to know everything I did and every thing I ate. When Suzie and I first started calling each other, I thought _ would be more of a burden on me, but I was completely wrong. I learned so much from her. She gave me more than I could ever give her. I will never forget her or the talks we had. I now know that I must never take anything for granted, especially my health and the gift of life."	['sad']
We may infer from the passage all of the following EXCEPT that _ .	"These young men were a different kind of prisoner from those we had seen before. They were brave, and hostile; they would not take orders, and shouted ""Amandla!"" at every opportunity. Their instinct was to confront rather than cooperate. The authorities did not know how to handle them, and they turned the island upside down. During the Rivonia Trial, I remarked to a security policeman that if the government did not reform itself, the freedom fighters who would take our place would some-day make the authorities miss us. That day had indeed come on Robben Island. In these young men we saw the angry revolutionary spirit of the times. I had had some warning. On a visit with Winnie a few months before, she had managed to tell me through our coded conversation that there was a rising class of discontented youths who were violent and Africanist in beliefs. She said I should be aware of them. The new prisoners were shocked by what they considered the inhuman conditions of the island, and said that they could not understand how we could live in such a way. We told them that they should have seen the island in 1964. But they were almost as sceptical of us as they were of the authorities. They chose to ignore our calls for discipline and thought our advice weak and unassertive . It was obvious that they regarded us, the Rivonia Trialists, as moderates .After so many years of being branded a radical revolutionary, to be seen as a moderate was a novel and not altogether pleasant feeling. I knew that I could react in one of two ways: I could scold them for their disrespect or I could listen to what they were saying. I chose the latter. Then some of these men, came into our section. I asked them to tell us about their movement and beliefs. Shortly after their arrival on the island, the commanding officer came and asked me as a favour to address the young men. He wanted me to tell them to behave themselves, to recognize the fact that they were in prison and to accept the discipline of prison life.I told him that I was not prepared to do that. Under the circumstances, they would have regarded me as a follower of the authorities.

Bad stress may happen when you are _ .	Are you ever so worried about something that you even have a headache or can't sleep at night? Do you ever feel a stomachache during a test? If so, then you know what stress is. Stress is what you feel when you are worried about something. When you are under stress, you may feel angry, sad, scared, or afraid --all this can give you a stomachache or a headache. In modern society, most people are under the higher stress than ever before. There are different kinds of stress. Some kinds of stress are good and others are bad. Good stress may happen when someone asks you to answer questions in class or when you have to give a report. This kind of stress can help you to finish things better. Under this stress, you will find yourself have more motivation and energy to study. However, bad stress can happen if the stress lasts too long. You may not feel well if a family member is sick, if you're having problems at school, or if anything else makes you upset every day. That kind of stress isn't going to help you. The best way to keep stress away is to have a balanced life. If you get enough sleep and food, and if you exercise and leave time for fun, you'll feel less stress.	['having problems at school']
In this passage, the author wants to tell _ .	I heard many parents complaining that their teenage children are rebelling. I wish it were so. At your age you ought to be growing away from your parents. You should be learning to stand on your own two feet. But take a good look at the present rebellion. It seems that teenagers are taking the same way of showing that they disagree with their parents. Instead of striking out boldly on their own, most of them are clutching at one another's hands for reassurance. They claim they want to dress as they please. But they all wear the same clothes. They set off in new directions in music. But somehow they all end up huddled round listening to the same record. Their reason for thinking or acting in thus-and-such a way is that the crowd is doing it. They have come out of their cocoon into a larger cocoon. It has become harder and harder for a teenager to stand up against the popularity wave and to go his or her own way. Industry has firmly carved out a teenage market. These days every teenager can learn from the advertisements what a teenager should have and be. And many of today's parents have come to award high marks for the popularity of their children. All this adds up to a great barrier for the teenager who wants to find his or her own path. But the barrier is worth climbing over. The path is worth following. You may want to listen to classical music instead of going to a party. You may want to collect rocks when everyone else is collecting records. You may have some thoughts that you don't care to share at once with your classmates. Well, go to it. Find yourself. Be yourself. Popularity will come -- with the people who respect you for who you are. That is the only kind of popularity that really counts.	['teenagers to try to pursue their real selves']
How long can the viruses live on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards?	The H1Nl virus has been spreading world-wide,it is important for us to know how to control it.Please pay attention to the following points: 1.Don't touch your face.Above all,keep your hands away from your eyes,mouth and nose,all of which serve pathways for the viruses to enter your body. 2.Wash your hands.If you have to touch your face,wash your hands,getting under the fingernails for 20 to 30 seconds with hot soap and water before.Soaps with surfactants can deal with flu viruses. 3.Cover your nose and mouth.When someone sneezes or coughs,liquid drops with flu viruses as far as three feet through the air and land on your nose and mouth,so it's best to keep at least an arm's length distance when talking to someone who shows signs of infection .In order to protect others,cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze,and clean your hands afterward.Viruses can live for hours,or even longer when on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards. 4.Consider buying a mask in case you need it in the future.Some research suggests that masks reduce the risk of getting the flu viruses by as much as 80%.But it also suggests that if you don't wash hands,the mask doesn't work well.So wash your hands and use the mask,especially wearing face masks in crowded places is also useful. ,.

People don't want to give up their independence because _ .	One of the most striking findings of a recent questionnaire in the UK is that of the people interviewed, one in two believes that it is becoming more difficult to meet someone to start a family with. Why are many people finding it increasingly difficult to start and keep close relationships? Does modern life really make it harder to fall in love? Or are we making it harder for ourselves? It is certainly the case today that nowadays couples benefit in different ways from relationships. Women no longer rely upon partners for economic security or status. A man doesn't expect his wife to be in sole charge of running his household and raising his children. But perhaps the knowledge that we can live perfectly well without a partnership means that it takes much more to persuade people to abandon their independence. In theory, finding a partner should be much simpler these days. Only a few generations ago,your choice of soul mate was limited by geography, social convention and family tradition. Although it was never clear, many marriages were essentially arranged. Now those barriers have been broken down. You can approach a builder or a brain surgeon in any bar in any city on any given evening. When the world is your oyster , you surely have a better chance of finding a pearl. But it seems that the traditions have been replaced by an even tighter restriction:the limitation of choice. The expectations of partners are made greater to an unmanageable degree:good looks, impressive salary, kind to grandmother, and so on. There is no room for error in the first impression. We think that a relationship can be perfect. If it isn't,it is intended to be thrown away. We work to protect ourselves against future heartache and don't put in the hard emotional labor needed to build a strong relationship. Twelve-hour work at the office makes relaxed after-hours dating difficult. The cost of housing and child-raising creates pressure to have a stable income and career before a life partnership.

Pet phrase can _ according to studies.	"You must have a favorite line or _ you repeat often in your conversations. Studies say that pet phrases can reflect our changing society and reveal information about a person's personality. Here are some of the most popular pet phrases among young people. ---nuts I love the word and use it whenever I think a person is stupid, or a behavior is crazy. I learned the term from one of my classmates. Once, we saw two high school girls wearing miniskirts on a very cold winter day and my classmate called the two girls ""nuts"".

Once, my classmates and I were discussing how amusing QQ is. One guy suddenly burst out, ""I have MSN too"". This comment had no relation with the topic we were discussing. I used this word and everybody laughed. I think it is a fantastic word that can change awkwardness to amusement. Mu Li, 20, journalism major at Beijing Normal University. ---I'm giddy! I use this word a lot---more often than my classmates. It has became a symbol of me, as my friends sometimes refer to me as the guy who often says the word. I am a person who wants to be different and this word gives me that feeling. Chen Zhou, 21, Nanjing University. ---stunning I only use this word with my friends. My parents don't understand it. The word, which is only used among people of my age, is intimate. I think it stands for being young and energetic. And I want to be young forever, so I like the word.

According to the passage, which of the following is right?	"The right to pursue happiness is issued to us all with our birth, but no one seems quite sure what it is. A holy man in India may think that happiness is in himself. It is in needing nothing from outside himself. In wanting nothing, he lacks nothing. We westerners, however, are taught that the more we have from outside ourselves, the happier we will be, and then we are made to want. We are even told it is our duty to want. Advertising, one of our major industries, exists not to satisfy these desires but to create them--and to create them faster than any man's money in his pocket can satisfy them. Here, obviously someone is trying to buy the dream of happiness and spending millions upon millions every year in the attempt. Clearly the happiness-market is not running out of customers. I doubt the holy man's idea of happiness, and I doubt the dreams of the happiness-market, too. Whatever happiness may be, I believe, it is neither in having nothing nor in having more, but in changing--in changing the world and mankind into pure states. To change is to make efforts to deal with difficulties. As Yeats, a great Irish poet once put it, happiness we get for a lifetime depends on how high we choose our difficulties. Robert Frost, a great American poet, was thinking in almost the stone terms when he spoke of ""the pleasure of taking pains."" It is easy to understand. We even demand difficulty for the fun in our games. We demand it because without difficulty there can be no game. And a game is a way of making something hard for the fun of it. The rules of the game are man-made difficulties. When the player ruins the fun, he always does so by refusing to play by the roles. It is easier to win at chess if you are free, at your pleasure, to cast away all the rules, but the fun is in winning within the rules. The same is true to happiness. The buyers and sellers at the happiness-market seem to have lost their sense of the pleasure of difficulty. Heaven knows what they are playing, but it seems a dull game. And the Indian holy man seems dull to us, I suppose, because he seems to be refusing to play anything at all. The western weakness may be in the dreams that happiness can be bought while the eastern weakness may be in the idea that there is such a thing as perfect happiness in man himself. Both of them forget a basic fact: no difficulty, no happiness."	['There is no fun without playing by the rules.']
How did Clemmons prove that her idea was reasonable?	"No one really knows how the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids. But Maureen Clemmons has a theory . She thinks the Egyptians may have used kites. ""If you look at ht top center of every monument , you see wings,"" Clemons said. ""I think the Egyptians have been trying to tell us in pictures for 3,000 years that this is how they built the pyramids."" She thinks that earliest Egyptian workers might make use of kites to lift the stones with the help of the desert wind. She got a team of aeronautic engineers to help her test the theory. Yesterday, in the Mojave Desert, they put their theory to the test using a nylon kite, three pulleys and an obelisk that weighs nearly four tons. The wind speed had to be just right. And amazingly, it worked. ""There's ly no evidence for kites in ancient Egypt,"" said Professor Carol Redmount of the University of California. ""There's no evidence of pulleys as we know them today."" Redmount says the historical evidence points to the ""Charlton Heston method,"" which basically relies on the theory of the muscle of slaves pushing and pulling huge stone blocks to create the pyramids. But the kite-lifting group will have none that. ""All I can remember from history is that Egyptians drank beer for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and as someone who has done field research on drinking beer, I know after I've had two beers and it's really hot. I'm not pushing or pulling anything,"" Clemmons said. ""So, I figured I'd try to think another way."""	['She had an experiment done to lift a large stone by using pulleys and a kite.']

Of course, this is a circular argument, because the more you read the more vocabulary you learn and the more words you know the more easily you can read. Don't make the mistake of reading with your dictionary beside you, looking up every single new or doubtful word. This is laborious and prevents you from practicing the skill of prediction. Sometimes in reading you find a word you know but the sense doesn't seem to fit in. This is not surprising because words have so many meanings and degrees of meaning. What is more, part of their meaning is shaped by the words around them. Keep looking at the surrounding words and asking yourself ""what sort of meaning would make sense here?"" The more that people study the reading process, the better they can pass on to language learners a range of advice to choose from. People have learned to read in all kinds of ways. Here is some information that could help you plan to be a better reader in the foreign language you are studying. 1)Work out the general meaning first When people read in a new language they often feel they must take a detailed approach, focusing on every word, particularly those they don't know. They read as if they were using a microscope, looking carefully at each of the small pieces(the individual words), but not necessarily seeing the whole picture at first. This is called the ""bottom-up"" approach. Other readers try to look first at the big picture(the ""top-down"" approach), attending to individual bricks only as necessary, a process that involves some intelligent guesswork. Generally this second approach is recommended by successful learners. 2)Interactive reading Another way of thinking about reading is to describe it as an interactive process, where the text brings something to you and you bring something to the text. Readers bring together all their knowledge of the world with what they see on the page in front of them. That is why, when reading in our own language, we don't need to read every word. We add meaning which is not actually stated. 3)From supported reading to independent reading Language learners start by needing considerable support as they read. Textbooks supply this support in the form of introductions that summaries the contents, glossaries, pictures, explanations of new grammar points. In your reading you need to move gradually from this support to reading more the text itself."	['trying to look first at the big picture']
The writer doesn't talk about _ in the passage.	"When you cut your skin, you bleed . If a person loses a lot of blood, he will become ill and may die. Blood is very important. People have always known that. At one time, some people even drank blood to make them strong! When doctors understand how blood goes around inside the body, they try ways of giving blood to people who need it. They take blood from the healthy people and give it to people who need it. This is called ""blood transfusion"". The blood goes from the arm of the healthy person into the arm of the sick person. But there are two problems. First, it does not always work. Sometimes people die when they have blood transfusion. Later, doctors find that we do not all have the same kind of blood. There are four groups--O, A, B and AB. We all have blood of one of these groups. They also find that they can give any kind of blood to people of group AB. But they find that they must give A-group blood to A-group people and B-group blood to B-group people. I have O-group blood and the doctor told me that I could give blood to anyone else safely. ks5u There is another problem. To give blood of the right kind, doctors have to find a person of the right blood group. Often they can not find a person in time. If they have a way to keep the blood until someone needs it, they can always have the right kind of blood. At first they find they can keep it in bottles for fifteen to twenty days. They do this by making it very cold. Then they find how to keep it longer. In the end they find a way of keeping blood for a very long time. We call a place where we keep money a ""bank"". We call a place where we keep blood a ""blood bank"". One day, when you grow up, you may decide to give blood to a ""blood bank"". In this way you may stop someone from dying. Or perhaps one day you may become ill. You may need blood. The ""blood bank"" will give it to you."	['where the blood bank is']
How do clinical psychologists respond when charged that their treatments are not supported by science?	"For years, there has been a bias against science among clinical psychologists . In a two-year analysis to be published in November inPerspectives on Psychological Science, psychologists led by Timothy B. Baker of the University of Wisconsin charge that many clinical psychologists fail to ""provide the treatments for which there is the strongest evidence of effectiveness"" and ""give more weight to their personal experiences than to science."" As a result, patients have no guarantee that their ""treatment will be informed by ... science."" Walter Mischel of Columbia University is even crueler in his judgment. ""The disconnect between what clinical psychologists do and what science has discovered is an extreme embarrassment,"" he told me, and ""there is a widening gap between clinical practice and science."" The ""widening"" reflects the great progress that psychological research has made in identifying the most effective treatments. Thanks to strict clinical trials, we now know that teaching patients to think about their thoughts in new, healthier ways and to act on those new ways of thinking are effective against depression, panic disorder and other problems, with multiple trials showing that these treatments -- the tools of psychology -- bring more lasting benefits than drugs. You wouldn't know this if you sought help from a typical clinical psychologist. Although many treatments are effective, relatively few psychologists learn or practice them. Why in the world not? For one thing, says Baker, clinical psychologists are ""very doubtful about the role of science"" and ""lack solid science training"". Also, one third of patients get better no matter what treatment (if any) they have, ""and psychologists remember these successes, believing, wrongly, that they are the result of the treatment."" When faced with evidence that treatments they offer are not supported by science, clinical psychologists argue that they know better than some study what works. A 2008 study of 591 psychologists in private practice found that they rely more on their own and colleagues' experience than on science when deciding how to treat a patient. If they keep on this path as insurance companies demand evidence-based medicine, warns Mischel, psychology will ""discredit itself."""	['They try to defend themselves.']

Why does the author write the passage?	If Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) is today one of the best-known and most popular figures of 20th-century Mexican art, it is undoubtedly because of her personality and the originality of a body of works. Her work is, above all, the expression of a life -- a tragic and stormy life, one that challenged all conventions. The mere mention of her name excites enthusiasm and admiration, but her work is rarely exhibited, and has not been shown in France for fifteen years. The selection to go on show at the Musee de l'Orangerie includes major works by the artist, with masterpieces from the Museo Dolores Olmedo. The life and work of Frida Kahlo cannot be separated from those of her companion Diego Rivera (1886-1957). Together they became figures of legend , and both have a place in the pantheon of 20th-century Mexican artists. Famous for his large wall paintings, Rivera's easel paintings, drawings and prints, which form a large part of his artistic production, are less well-known to the public in Europe. The exhibition aims to trace his artistic career from the early Cubist images, revealing his links with the Paris artists whose works are a key element in the Orangerie collections, to the paintings that established him as the founder of the 20th-century school of Mexican art. His travels throughout Europe influenced his vision and his skills without ever distancing him from his roots, thus confirming his place in history as the founder of the nationalist school. The exhibition devoted to the legendary couple Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo presents their works together, as if to confirm the impossibility of their divorce that was in fact finalised but reconsidered after just one year apart. It also gives us a better view of their respective artistic worlds, so different and yet so complementary , through the deep-rooted attachment they shared to their country.

When your colleague brings about a problem, you should _ .	"When something goes wrong, it can be very satisfying to say, ""Well, it's soandso's fault.""or ""I know I'm late, but it's not my fault; the car broke down.""It is probably not your fault, but once you form the habit of blaming somebody or something else for a bad situation, you are a loser. You have no power and could do nothing that helps change the situation. However, you can have great power over what happens to you if you stop focusing on whom to blame and start focusing on how to _ the situation.This is the winner's key to success. Winners are great at overcoming problems. For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you need to have your car examined more regularly. Or,you might start to carry along with you the useful phone numbers, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague causes you problems on the job for lack of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don't rely on this person. You should accept that the person is not reliable and find creative ways to work successfully regardless of how your colleague fails to do his job well. This is what being a winner is all about--creatively using your skills and talents so that you are successful no matter what happens. Winners don't have fewer problems in their lives; they have just as many difficult situations to face as anybody else. They are just better at seeing those problems as challenges and opportunities to develop their own talents. So,stop focusing on ""whose fault it is.""Once you are confident about your power over bad situations, problems are just stepping stone for success."	['find a better way to handle the problem']
Locally-grown fruits and vegetables taste good mostly because _ .	The Horn of Plenty is one of the largest natural health food stores within the Greater Hamilton area. We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept. Produce trucked in from far away may lose both taste and nutritional content. Community and home values When you buy direct from a farmer or buy locally-grown foods, you are engaged in a time-honored tradition between a grower and an eater. You also help keep dollars within your community.	['they are picked when they are fully grown']
When did the scientists make sure they found a new species of monkey?	The animal kingdom has a new member. On September 12, 2012, researchers made a report to the world that they discovered a new species of monkey. It is called the lesula. And it is only the second monkey species discovered in 28 years. Scientists first saw the lesula in June, 2007 in Congo, a country in Africa. The lesula lives in the rain forests. The monkey was first found as a pet in a local family. When researchers found it, the family told them that they caught the monkey in the wild and then kept it as a pet. The scientists have compared the lesula to the owl-faced monkey. The owl-faced monkey gets its name for having a long nose and a face that looks like an owl . The lesula and the owl-faced monkey are similar in size and both have a stripe on their nose. This shows the lesula and the owl-faced monkeys are close relatives, but different species. Scientists say the lesula usually weighs about twelve pounds. It has long blond hair. It eats like a vegetarian . Scientists say it is important to protect African rain forests because there may be other new species like lesula to be discovered in the future.	['In 2012.']
I didn't leave the window because I want _ .	"It was the end-of-year party. I had asked my mother to make us cookies. Mom's chocolate chips were the best. But two o'clock passed, and there was no sign of her. Most of the other mothers had come and gone, dropping off their cakes and chips. The party went on, but I wouldn't leave the window. The three o'clock bell soon took me away from my thoughts . I took my bag and walked out for home. The house was empty when I arrived. My heart was filled with anger . For the first time in my life, my mother had _ . I was lying on my bed when I heard her coming. ""Robbie,"" she called out. ""Where are you?"" She was looking for me from room to room, but I kept silent. When she came into my room, I didn't move, ""I'm so sorry,"" she said. ""I got busy and forgot."" She began to laugh. I couldn't believe it. I turned over and found that she wasn't laughing but crying. ""I'm so sorry. I let my boy down."" she cried like a little girl. I had never seen my mother cry. ""It's OK, Mom,"" I said, ""We didn't need those cookies. There was plenty of food to eat. Don't cry. It's all right."" We held each other in a long hug ."	['to see my mother coming']
According to the writer, what matters least when someone wants to talk?	"People like to tell me rubbish. Not just friends, but strangers ,too. Once, at the airport, my husband stepped off an escalator before me. When he realized I wasn't with him, he looked back and saw me hugging ( ) a stranger. I'd asked the man behind me: ""Did you have fun in Vegas?"" His answer broke me heart. After 50 years away, I'd come to say goodbye to the lover of his life, _ was dying of cancer. ""I should have married her 50 years ago,"" he said. I hugged him, and then he was gone. Moments later, my husband said: ""He told you all that on the escalator?"" I nodded. ""Maybe he just needed to tell somebody, And I happened to ask."" When someone wants to talk, you just need to ask a question. The words don't matter. It's the tone in your voice and the look in your eyes and the caring in your heart that count. Sometimes I think the whole world is crying out to be heard. And yet, we don't ask the question or say the things we need to say to those who matter most to us while there is still time, and a chance, to do so. Recently I heard from a reader who shared with me the eulogy she'd written after losing her mother. I wish her mother could have read it. I can only hope her mother knew all the things her daughter wrote about her--that she was known so well and loved so much. I like to think people will say a few nice things about me when I'm gone. But given a choice, I would rather hear those things before I go. Wouldn't we all? That started me thinking. I need to tell my children I am proud of them. They know it, but it can't hurt to say it again. I need to tell my sister I will forever in her debt . I was the one who left. She was the one who stayed, who's ""been there"" for our family--for our mother, our dad, our brothers and me. And to my husband, I need to say, well, he puts up with a lot. In fact, I need to say a lot of things to whole lot of people. Maybe you do, too. You can tell me, if you want. But maybe you should tell them first."	['The question you ask.']
Why does Devin think common seasonal Christmas music is annoying? _ .	"Everybody is familiar with Christmas music; its played everywhere. Whether it's the music from a grocery store or random songs on the radio, holiday music remains to flood in the air from the day after Thanksgiving to the beginning of December. Christmas music gets extremely over- played through the Holiday season. ""'I think the common seasonal Christmas music is annoying because it keeps being played over and over.""said junior Devin McFarland. The Christmas music still played today is what she heard in her childhood. Some famous Christmas songs have never been changed. The original music is played so much that in some cases people dream about or even sing Christmas music in their sleep. She wishes that there was a wider variety of songs. She likes the newer Christmas songs that bands either re- make or write themselves. ""They have a fresher sound to Christmas songs, and they add their own characteristics to them so that they are more like their own songs. "" McFarland explained. Christmas is known as a happy and homecoming festival, so the holiday season is meant to be spent happily with your family. It is recognized that the music media wants to get the point across and add to the festival atmosphere. But isn't the music being pushed to the public too much? Most grocery stores play the music non-stop ,Christmas song after Christmas song, disgusting the customers who don't like that kind of music. You can walk through stores and attempt turning off the music, but sometimes it's impossible to do so. On the other hand, almost everyone has witnessed random persons walking along happily and either singing or whistling to the tune of the song that's played throughout the store."	['Because the music is played too much']
What would be the best title for the text?	Programs may already be installed on the computers at your school or university. If not, you can consider looking at catalogues to see what is available on CD-ROM. Some people question whether computers can really help you to read, any better than picking up a book. There is some justification for this, but listen to the arguments from people who believe that computers have something to offer. The first argument relates to motivation. Anything that makes you spend more time reading will be helpful, so if you are someone who likes to turn on your computer as soon as you walk into your room, then you could find yourself motivated to spend more time on your foreign-language reading if it appears on your screen. There is more to computers than motivation, though. You need to make use of all the technical possibilities, because good programs allow things to happen which are not possible with a book. This leads on to the idea of autonomy in language learning. We have already seen many times in this book that you, the language learner, will make a far bigger difference to your ultimate success than your teacher will. With a computer, you can decide how many repetitions to have and how to respond to the commands. In some programs you also shape the direction of the story you are reading by the selections you make. In other words, you don't have to move along at the pace of the rest of the class, which you may find too slow or too fast. The flip side of learner autonomy is learner misuse of programs. Some programs allow short-cuts which give you a sense of having finished, but without actually having done much learning. _ At the end of a session using well-designed materials, you should learn more than some new vocabulary and sentence patterns; you should also learn more about the reading process. As with all aspects of your language learning, you can finish your session with a critical eye to what you have learned from the program. This will include thinking about whether to repeat it or move on to another level.	['Computer-AssistedReading']
Who lives in John Williams' house?	More than 40 years ago, John Williams gave away all of his belongings and went off to the mountains to live the way people lived 100 years ago. For food he traps wild animals, fishes in the rivers, and plants whatever he can. John lives in a cabin he made by hand, out of trees he chopped down with an ax. Though he has no s he knows of, he does have a deer he raised from a fawn. The deer lives in the house in the winter and goes with John when he goes into the forest for food. Nobody lives within fifty miles of his cabin in the mountains and John has not been out of the mountains during the entire forty years. One day last year I hiked in to see how John lives. It was like going back in time. There were no roads, no stores, no noise, no pollution, not even a post office. Most notable of all, there were no people and that's just the way John Williams wants to keep his part of the world--without people. But there is a paradox in his story. John is an educated man. He has books and nobody knows how he got them. Mostly he reads about his world, the forest, the animals, the plants, and the mountains. He has seen airplanes flying overhead but does not want to know about them. For him, electricity is lightning, not light bulbs, refrigerators, televisions, or washing machines. John Williams is 85 years old and had not had a sick day in his life. He attributes his long life to the fact that it has nothing to do with people and in order that he might enjoy many more years of health, happiness, and solitude, I will not tell you where his kingdom lies. There is no room there for you or me.	['John Williams himself.']
The author let Seema pick out one of her dresses because she wanted to _ .	"I still remember the day when my mom said, ""Let's get you some new clothes."" You can imagine that to any little girl that would mean the world, but to me it meant the universe, because we were not very rich. After she said that, all I could think about was what kinds of clothes I would choose. To my surprise, my mom allowed me to pick out three dresses: a pink one, a blue one and a yellow one. The yellow one was my favorite. I had a best friend named Seema, whose family was even poorer than ours. We played and studied together, and spent the best days of our childhood laughing at the silly stories we made up. I was excited to show her my three beautiful new dresses. She loved them all and was happy for me, but tearfully explained to me that her father could only afford to buy her clothes for her birthday. I felt sorry, and then did something that surprised even myself: I asked her to pick out one of my dresses for herself. To my disappointment, she picked up my favorite--the yellow one. Please remember, I was only seven years. My heart almost popped out of my chest. But as she held it against her body, and I saw how brightly she smiled, I stopped feeling any hurt. I told her it looked lovely on her. I'll always remember Seema's smile, and how at that moment nothing mattered more. When you value your friendships, nothing else matters! We're still best friends today."	"[""show her pity for Seema's family""]"

What's the passage mainly about ?	"In 1988, Mary Anderson was at the Miami airport checking in for a flight to Norway to be with her husband when she was told she wouldn't be able to check her luggage without paying a $100 surcharge . Mary had no money as her new husband had left for Norway and she had no one else to call . "" I was completely desperate and tried to think which of my things I could manage without ,"" says Mary . As tears ran down her face , a voice behind her said , ""That's okay, I'll pay for her ."" Rather surprised , Mary turned around to see a tall man whom she had never seen before . He had a gentle and kind voice that was firm and decisive . Although this happened twenty years ago , Mary still remembers the authority that radiated from the man . Mary was pleased to bring her luggage to Norway and told the stranger she would give his money back . The man wrote his name and address on a piece of paper and gave it to Mary . She thanked him repeatedly . When she finally walked off towards the boarding gate, he waved goodbye to her . That man turned out to be Barack Obama . Mary paid the money back to Obama the day she joined her husband . At that time he had just finished his job as a poorly paid community worker in Chicago , and had started his law studies at Harward University . In the spring of 2006 , Mary's parents heard Obama was considering a run for President . They wrote a letter saying that they would support him. At the same time , they thanked Obama for helping their daughter 18 years earlier . And Obama replied , "" I want to thank you for the lovely things you wrote about me and for reminding me of what happened at Miami airport . I'm happy I could help her then , and I'm delighted to hear that your daughter is happy in Norway . Please send her my best wishes . Sincerely , Barack Obama, United States Senator ."""

Girls can do the following in the first Barbie shop in Shanghai except _ .	Fifty-three years ago Barbie Millicent Roberts first appeared in the world of toys. Since then, Barbie doll, as everyone called her, has become the most successful toy doll in history. Her parent, the Mattel Company, said that 90% of all American girls between 3 and 10 have at least one Barbie at home. However, Barbie is facing some trouble at present . There are many similar dolls on the market in competition with her. Another doll named Bratz, for example, came to life thirteen years ago. She looks more like today's pop stars with heavy makeup and miniskirts. And her company offers more kinds of clothes too. It seems that Barbie has lost her magic among older girls. 'For younger girls, playing with a Barbie is much fun. But when you get older, you want something smarter and more modern,' says Vera Shepherd, a shop assistant in a New York toy store. It is good news that on the international market, Barbie is still No. 1. Although Mattel is selling fewer barbie in the United States these years, sales in other countries are still going up. In January 2009, Mattel opened its first Barbie store in Shanghai, where girls can shop, eat, drink or even become _ for their own Barbies. Mattel is planning big celebrations for Barbie's 53rd birthday. She has called Fashion designers from all over the world to make new dresses for Barbie. How long will Barbie stay popular in the world of toy dolls? It is hard to say, but 53 is surely not the age to retire .	['taking photos']
Why don't people browse around the shops to buy Christmas presents thus year?	With only two weeks to go before Christmas, buying presents is a lug priority for a lot of people. However, this year not so many people are leaving their homes to browse around the shops. These days lots of people do their shopping in the comfort of their own home with the help of the Internet. Online shopping is becoming more and more popular for a number of reasons: prices are often lower online, you don't have to queue up in busy shops and you can buy almost any product imagin- able with just a few clicks of your mouse. Computer trends are often man-dominated but this year women are expected to do more shop-ping on the Internet than men. It seems .that women are now more attracted to the convenience of on-line shopping than they used to be. Average spending online this Christmas by women will rise to $240 compared to the slightly lower average $233 for men, while the average spending per person on the high street is only $197. 70% of lnternet users, male and female, are now buying their Christmas gifts online. In the past a lot of people were unwilling to shop online. Many were worried about the security of entering their card details on the Intemet and the reliability of the Internet but as shopping; online has become more widespread, these worries have begun to disappear. 45% of Internet users still do have security worries but it hasn't slowed the ever-increasing numbers of online shoppers. One victim of the online shopping boom is the UK high street. Christmas trading can represent up to 60% of turnover for some stores. Many companies are concerned that not enough shoppers are coming through their doors in the run-up to Christmas. As a result there are lots of special offers in the shops. Most shops traditionally have sales after Christmas but this year the bargains have come early.	['Because they go shopping on the lnternet.']
What is not the cause for people to leave their homeland?	The USA is a land of immigrants. Between 1815 and 1914, the world witnessed the greatest peaceful migration in its history: 35 million people, mostly Europeans, left their homelands to start new lives in America. Why did these people risk everything by leaving their homes and families? First, what forced emigrants to make the decision to leave? One major cause for European farmers to leave was the rise in population which in turn led to land hunger. Another was politics. There was an increased taxation and the growth of armies, and many young men fled eastern Europe to avoid being forced to join the army. Physical hunger provided another pressing reason. Following the collapse of the economy of southern Italy in the 1860s, hundreds of thousands decided to start a new life in America. Religion also encouraged millions to leave the Old World. In short, people chose to leave their homes for social, economic and religious reasons. As a result, by 1890 among a total population of 63 million, there were more than nine million foreign-born Americans. But what were the attractions? First of all, there was the promise of land which was so scarce in Europe. Next, factories were calling for workers, and pay conditions were much better than back home. Men were needed to open up the West and build the long railroads, and new towns needed settlers to live in and to develop business. There was the space for religious people to practice their faith in peace. This immigration meant that by around the 1850s Americans of non-English had started to be more than those of English. As we know, there were losers. To start with, there were those unwilling immigrants, the slaves who had been used as a source of cheap labour. Nor should we forget the equally unlucky American Indians. By 1860 there were 27 million free whites, four million slaves and a mere 488,000 free blacks. Nowadays, the USA is still seen by millions as the Promised Land. As always, it remains an attractive place to those who think it will offer them a second chance.	['The search for adventure.']
Where did the story take place?	"Charlie was spending his summer holidays by the sea. One day he climbed over some rocks. He was looking for some crabs for supper. He took off his shorts and put them on a rock. The afternoon went quickly. Time was flying by. Look! The sea was coming in fast. It was over some of the rocks now. Charlie looked up. ""It's getting late. Oh dear! Look at the sea. Where are my shorts now?"" he thought. He saw them on a rock. Oh dear! The rock was an island! Now he must swim and got them. Charlie jumped into the sea and started swimming. He reached the rock and put his shorts on his head. Then he started swimming back. Oh no! The sea was too strong for Charlie.

_ go to evening classes after school in Singapore.	How much do you know about school life in Singapore? In Singapore, many middle school students spend a lot of time on their studies. People there always think that good schooling is the ticket to success . So, many of these students try their best to get good results in their exams. They have a lot of homework every day and exams are usually a big problem to them. Sometimes, a few even have to go to evening classes after school. Schools have many activities outside school hours. The students can join in sports and games, music and dance, swimming and rock-climbing. They also join in community service. In their free time, most students like to listen to pop music. Hollywood movies, Hong Kong and Singapore movies are very popular, too. Some of them also spend their free time searching the Internet, e-mailing their friends, playing computer and video games. They sometimes go to cafes, fast-food restaurants, shopping centers and big bookstores. So life for middle school students in Singapore is not easy but rich and colorful.	['A few of the students']
The writer hesitated to cook potato pancakes probably because _ .	"When the one-year anniversary of my mother's passing came around, I found myself in the kitchen preparing some of her favorite dishes. As I poured myself into cooking, some of the deep sadness I was experiencing at this one-year mark moved through me. I loved my mom's turkey soup. I remembered the time she made some especially for me. It was summer then and I had a terrible head cold. She arrived unexpectedly one afternoon at my work place with a huge jar of her turkey noodle soup. At the thought, I began to feel a little more relieved in the pain of losing her. It was then that I realized I was reconnecting with my mother through food. I laughed a bit at myself when I reflected on all the dishes I had cooked that week. Without knowing it, I had created a beautiful ceremony to honor my mother and to comfort myself at this vulnerable time. I suddenly felt my mother at hand and was filled with her presence. I was so uplifted and excited that I began talking to her, imagining she was there. ""What else should we make?"" I asked of us both, wanting to keep the ceremony from ending. ""Irish Potato Pancakes,"" was the reply. I hesitated. The thought of these brought up another loss. The last time I made potato pancakes was two and a half years ago. I had taken off my engagement ring and never found it again. Since then, I resisted using that recipe even though I really liked those pancakes as if it were partly to blame. My mom should know better than to suggest these, I thought. She knew how upset I was about losing my ring. But despite these hesitations, I found myself caught up in the joy and celebration of the moment, and I reached for the cookbook without another thought of the ring. My mom did love Irish things. I opened the cookbook and turned to the pancake recipe. At once, something at the bottom of the page caught my eye... It was shining! Amazingly, there, pressed into the pages of this book, was my diamond ring! That day, I made potato pancakes in the shape of hearts."	['they reminded her of the loss of her ring']
What's the purpose of the Fit Fridays program?	"Students at New Market Elementary School had a fitter lifestyle last week. About 50 students participated in a 30-minute workout after school on Friday in the school's gym. This was a Fit Fridays program introduced at the school by Families Plus, a non-profit group that provides programs to enrich the lives of families and children in Frederick County. The free program aims to encourage students from kindergarten through fifth grade to be physically active by having them participate in various age-appropriate activities designed to promote a love of exercise, according to Kim Ragan, head of the program. The program, which started at the school on Nov.9, 2012, has since become a hit, Ragan said. Emily Liston, 37, said the program allows students to focus on fitness as a priority in their lives. ""There're so many things to stop them from being active,"" she said. ""So, anything to keep them moving is good, especially in the winter months"". Jennifer Mitchell, 40, whose daughter Alexandra, 7, participated in the Fit Fridays program, said that learning the importance of being active isn't the only thing students are learning from the new program. ""It's a great opportunity for them to get some exercise and also to learn to get along and socialize, to learn teamwork,"" she said. ""In school they have to do activities like this but they want to do it."" Riley Glynn, 9, a fourth grader at the school, said his favorite part of the program is getting to spend more time with his friends. ""It's fun to play with people,"" Riley said. ""It's like physical education after school but it really helps you."" ""You learn how to make yourself stronger,"" said Megan Hummel, 7, a first grader. Ragan said she plans to expand the program to include other schools in the county, but she has been having trouble finding fitness instructors to participate. ""As soon as I can get instructors to teach we'll expand,"" she said."	['To keep students active through exercise']
"Which of the following is a ""pain in the neck""?"	"We all know what it is like to be unable to turn your head because of a cold in the muscles of your neck, or because an unexpected twist has made your neck ache and stiff. Your whole body feels tight. The slightest move makes you jump with pain.Nothing could be worse than a pain in the neck. That is why we use the phrase to describe some people who give you the same feeling. We have all met such people. One is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands--often at the wrong time--during a performance in the theater. He keeps you from hearing the actors. Even worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins. They come hurrying down to your row of seats. You are comfortably settled down, with your hat and heavy coat in your lap. You must stand up to let them pass. You are proud of your self-control after they have settled into their seats... Well, what now... Good God, one of them is up again.He forgot to go to the men's room, and once more you have to stand up, hanging on to your hat and coat to let him pass. Now, that is ""a pain in the neck"". Another, well-known to us all, is the person sitting behind you in the movies. His mouth is full of popcorn; he is chewing loudly, or talking between bites to friends next to him. None of them remain still. Up and down, back and forth, they go for another bag of popcorn, or something to drink. Then, there is the man sitting next to you at a lunch counter smoking a smelly cigar.He wants you to enjoy it too, and blows smoke across your food into your mouth. We must not forget the man who comes into a bus or subway car and sits down next to you, just as closes you will let him. You are reading the newspaper and he leans over and stretches his neck so that he can read the paper with you. He may even turn the paper to the next page before you are ready for it. We also call such a person a ""rubber-neck"", always stretching his neck to where it does not belong, like neighbors who watch all your visitors. They enjoy invading your privacy. People have a strong dislike for rubber-necks. They hate being spied upon."	['Someone who throws trash   out of his car window on the highway.']
The best title for the passage should be _ .	Don't you think your schoolbag is too heavy to bear? The e-schoolbag will free you from the weight. It is said that e-schoolbags are going to be brought into use in Chinese middle schools soon. An experiment with several hundred e-schoolbags will begin in seven cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang. And the e-schoolbags are going to cover all over China if the experiment proves to be successful. In fact, the e-schoolbag should perhaps be called an e-notebook. It is a small hand-held computer for school students. Heavy schoolbags have long been a serious problem for school students. The average schoolbag of middle school students weighs up to 5 kilos. But the e-schoolbag will change everything. It is much lighter than a usual schoolbag, weighing under 1 kilo. Also, it is no bigger than a usual book, but it can still hold all the things for study, such as a textbook, a notebook and exercise book. They could be made into chips that are as small as a stamp. The students can read the text page by page on the screen. They can still take notes using a special electronic pen. If they want to know the meaning or the pronunciation of a new word, or even e-mail their teachers, it's just a press of a button. In some foreign countries, it is becoming common. But it is hard to tell when people will receive this new form of study. Some say that e-textbooks can be easily broken, some say that it is not good to students' eyesight to look at the screen for long. But only time will tell.	['A New Invention, A New Schoolbag']
Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	Motorists over the age of 75 face compulsory tests of their eyesight and ability to drive under proposals being considered by ministers. The biggest _ of motoring law in a generation could also lead to all drivers having to give assurances of their fitness to get behind the wheel every 10 years. Other changes under consideration include issuing daylight driving licenses for motorists with night blindness, together with stricter checks on all drivers whose medical condition brought a threat to other road users. It is understood that the proposals will be part of a review of the law governing the medical fitness of drivers that will be announced publicly by the summer. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is dealing with a rising number of motorists who are concerned that they have conditions---from failing eyesight to epilepsy---that could affect their driving. In 2006, the DVLA dealt with 600,000 motorists whose physical ability to drive needed to be recertified , a 20 per cent rise on the previous year. With an ageing population, the biggest challenge is dealing with the rising number of elderly motorists. By 2021, there will be an estimated three million drivers over the age of 70 on Britain's roads. Drivers must renew their licenses at the age of 70 and every three years thereafter. The applicant is legally required to tell the DVLA of any conditions that could weaken their ability behind the wheel. Ministers have ruled out a compulsory maximum age for driving but will instead rely on tightening up the checks on motorists over the age of 75. The most likely option would be tests to ensure motorists were fit to drive. They would include an eyesight test and a cognitive test that would prove a driver's ability to react to road signs, driving conditions, pedestrians and vehicles. However, checks are likely to be tightened at all ages. The strictest controls are expected to be imposed on motorists of any age who have had a heart attack or stroke. They could have to produce a doctor's approval to resume driving. Anyone making a false declaration would be guilty of a criminal offence.	['Drivers at all ages will be expected to provide their medical condition.']
How many secret things does the passage tell us?	"The Secret World of Disneyland The cat It is not easy to keep the park clean.

When Iron Man was fighting an army of Hammer's Iron Man robots, people in the theater were _ .	Compared to Iron Man 1, which I really like, Iron Man 2 has more action, better special effects and is funnier. In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces two enemies--a weapon producer named Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a horrible-looking Russian who wants revenge for something related to Tony's father. Besides the two enemies, Tony is also facing his own death. His man-made heart, which gives his Iron Man suit its power, is also harming his body. My favourite part of the movie was when Iron Man uses his laser against an army of Hammer's Iron Man robots. Everyone in the theater was cheering. My favourite special effects scene was the fight scene at a car race. Ivan tore Tony's car apart piece by piece. A funny part in the movie is when Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is inside a boxing ring with Happy Hogan (played by director Jon Favreau). Happy Hogan tries to hit Natalie Rushman. However, he is the one who ends up on the floor. The only problem I had with the movie was that I didn't understand why Ivan had so much hate toward Tony. I loved Iron Man 1 very much, and I expected Iron Man 2 to be much better. And after watching the movie, I'd like to say it is even better than I expected.	['excited']
At the age of twelve, Sally Ride _ .	"When Sally Ride was ten years old, she had no idea that she would some day grow up to be one of America's first woman astronauts. In fact, if you had asked her then what wanted to be, she would have said, "" I want to play shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers."" Sally collected baseball cards by the boxful, and she knew the name and batting average of every player in the National League. But major league baseball didn't seem much of a possibility for a girl, even an athletic one like Sally, so her father and mother talked her into taking tennis lessons when she was twelve. At first she hated to trade in her baseball bat for a tennis racket, but it wasn't long before she started to win tournaments in her new sport. "" Tennis became much more fun when I started winning,"" Sally remembers. Soon a row of trophies replaced her box of baseball cards, and tennis star Billie Jean King replaced Dodger shortstop Maury Wills as her sports idol. Sally first became interested in the space program in 1962 when astronaut John Glenn orbited the earth in his Mercury space capsule. Sally was ten years old at the time, but she remembers the launch and the splashdown as if they happened yesterday. The girl who used to memorize batting averages became a space fan. She quickly learned the name of every NASA astronaut(there were only eight of them in 1962), the date of every launch, and the name and number of every spacecraft from Freedom 7 to Skylab 3. She could tell you the speed of light (186,300 miles per second), the distance to the moon (238,860 miles), and the names of the three nearest stars( the Sun, Alpha Centauri, and Barnard's Star). By the time she was sixteen, Sally had decided to become an astrophysicist, a scientist who studies space. She had also become a nationally ranked tennis player. She remembers yawning through an important tennis match on June 20, 1969, after staying up all night to watch Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon. Sally lost the match. As Sally got older, many of her friends started playing professional tennis. Some of them tried to talk her into quitting school to join them on the professional tennis circuit. But Sally said no. "" Black holes are more interesting to me than backhands,"" she told them. Now she knows that she made the right choice, but in 1970 Sally had no way of knowing that NASA would open the space program to women."	['was persuaded into taking tennis training']

All the following statements are reasons for allowing old people to continue working EXCEPT that _ .	"There have been discussions about retire age limit recently. Does it make sense to make people retire at a particular age, say, 55? 60? Some people work well into their 70s and 80s, running families, countries or corporations while other people, despite being fit and highly talented, are forced to retire in their fifties or even earlier. Here I will examine whether people should be allowed to continue working as long as they want or whether they should be encouraged to retire at a particular stage. Some people think there are several reasons for allowing older people to continue working. Firstly, older employees are more experienced and their knowledge can be lost to his company or business if they are made to retire. Secondly, older employees are often extremely loyal and more willing to carry out company policies than younger staff. Another point is related to our society's attitudes to the old. To force someone to retire at 50 or 60 indicates that the society does not value the contribution of these people, which may be regarded as age discrimination. However, others believe that allowing older people to work indefinitely is not a good policy. Age alone is no guarantee of ability. Old people are ambitious workaholics. Many young employees are more skillful than older staff, who may have been stuck in one area or unit for most of their working lives. _ . In addition, without age limits, many people would continue to work purely because they did not have any other plans. Another reason is that older people should be rewarded by society for their life's labor by being given generous pensions and the freedom to enjoy their leisure. We now have youngsters who can't find jobs because old people refuse to retire. This new generation of ""old people"" may think they will never die due to modern advances in medicine. With many young people unemployed or frustrated in low-level positions, older workers are expected to retire. However, this can affect their right to work. I feel that giving workers more flexibility and choice over their retirement age will benefit both society and the individual."	['they can be ambitious workaholics']
Why should Dr. Malone come to ISM early?	Because I will be away for a few days after Spring Break, I am writing this during the actual holiday, when I can use time to catch up on a number of purely administrative items. First of all, you should have received the letter I sent out on April 2 advising of the transition arrangements to new leadership at ISM (International School of Moscow). In that letter I pointed out that Dr. Paul Malone will be arriving in Moscow on Monday, May 4th, and that I will work with him during that week to ensure smooth transition. My last day at ISM will be Friday, May 8th. Several people have asked me why I required Dr. Malone to come early. There are many problems facing ISM at the moment which have major implications for the future, and it makes sense for the new director to come aboard before the end of the school year. This will give him the chance to play a major role in the planning process for 2014--2015 and beyond. The fact that Paul Malone is able to arrive in early May is good for the school. I have been working closely with him, and will do everything possible to see that he can move in easily when I leave. From here I will go to Hong Kong for a couple of weeks to spend time in my new situation, and then I will return to the United States for a few weeks' vacation. In the most recent edition of the Compass(a kind of paper of ISM), I wrote briefly what I consider to be the major challenge for ISM in the future. I am sure that the new leadership of the school will be able to face those challenges in an active manner, which will ensure a strong future for the school. I shall certainly watch the progress of the school with interest. The results of the school for the past few years have been quite outstanding, and I fully expect that level of performance to continue.

According to the passage, which of the following statement is true?	"Riding was the favourite activity of Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. He usually rode good horses. One day, he was riding outside Washington, when a jockey came near. He did not know the President, but his professional eye was attracted by Mr. Jefferson's horse. He stopped and said that he wanted to buy the horse, but Mr. Jefferson politely refused his offer. The jockey offered more money for the horse, because the closer he looked at the horse, the more he liked it. All of his offers were refused, which made him angry. He then became rude, but his rudeness left as little an impression as his money, for Jefferson had a very good temper. At last, he hit Mr. Jefferson's horse with his whip, getting it to run suddenly. This would have thrown a less skillful rider to the ground, but Jefferson stayed on his seat, and controlled his horse well. The jockey then gave up. He rode with Mr. Jefferson side by side and began to talk with him about politics. Jefferson joined in the conversation. When they got into the city and came close to the gate of the presidential mansion , Mr. Jefferson stopped, and politely invited the man to enter. The jockey was surprised and asked, ""Why? Do you live here?"" ""Yes"" was the simple reply. ""Why, stranger, what's your name?"" ""My name is Thomas Jefferson."" Embarrassed, the man quickly left, while the President looked at him with a smile and then rode through the gate."

Cholera can be treated by _ .	Cholera is a water-borne disease that is spread through polluted water and food. Cholera is an illness caused by the bacterium. It produces a poison that causes a painless , watery diarrhea( ) that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not given. Most persons infected with cholera do not become ill, although the bacterium is present in their waste for 7-14 days. When this illness does strike, more than 90% of the time is not severe and is difficult to tell from other types of diarrhea. Less than 10% of sick persons develop cholera with signs of moderate or severe dehydration. A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food polluted with the cholera bacterium. The disease can spread rapidly in areas without the proper treatment of drinking water. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in dirty rivers and coastal waters. Shellfish eaten raw have been a source of cholera. Therefore, the disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another. Cholera can be simply and successfully treated by immediate replacement of the fluid and salts lost through diarrhea. Patients can be treated by being given a mixture of sugar and salt to be mixed with water and drunk in large amount. Antibiotics shorten the course and decrease the severity of the illness. To avoid cholera, we should eat well-cooked food instead of raw food.	['eating a lot of water mixed with sugar and salt and using antibiotics.']
Which university had the best work-ready graduates last year?	"Cambridge graduates are the most employable in the world,according to a global league table.The ancient university is the best at producing graduates who are'ready to work',a poll of major employers found. Oxford slipped to fourth place in the rankings having taken top spot last year.Harvard and Yale--part of the US'Ivy League'of universities--were second and third respectively. Five British universities were ranked in the top 20--one more than last year--and 12 were in the full list of 150. But the UK as a country came third--behind the US and Germany--when companies were asked to name the best nation for producing work--ready graduates. The table--the Global Employability University Ranking published by the International New York Times--also showed that universities in Asian countries were rapidly _ on their western counterparts . Asian universities claimed 20 percent of the top 150 places in 2014 compared with only 10 percent when the tables were first published in 2010. The other British universities in the top 20 were University College London,in 14th place,Imperial College London,in 15th,and Edinburgh,18th. The table showed the gap between a small number of top UK universities and less famous institutions. Laurent Dupasquier,managing partner at Emerging,a French human resources consultancy,said:""The top tier players.global brands (which tend to be all American and British).continue to lead,while other Anglo--Saxon universities,those that are mainly regional players,tend to develop less well,with an average of five places lost in comparison with last year."" ""Like the Premier League ,the champions have an international community of students and think internationally,unlike their more locally oriented counterparts."" The table was made following a survey of 2,500 major companies in 20 countries.Employers were asked to rank universities against a range of criteria including their production of graduates who are ready to work and their links with business. The study claimed that'the days of ivory towers are over'."	['Oxford.']
What is the writer's attitude towards the phenomenon?	"It appears that the police now have a device that can read license plates and check if a car is unregistered, uninsured or stolen. We already know that National Security Agency can dip into your Facebook page and Google searches. And it seems that almost every store we go into these days wants your home phone number and ZIP code as part of any deal. So when Edward Snowden -- now cooling his heels in Russia -- revealed the extent to which the NSA is spying on Americans, collecting data on phone calls we make, it's not as if we should have been surprised. We live in a world that George Orwell predicted in 1984. And that realization has caused sales of the 1949, dystopian novel to spike dramatically upward recently -- a 9,000% increase at one point on Amazon. com. Comparisons between Orwell's novel about a tightly controlled totalitarian future ruled by the everywhere-present Big Brother and today are, in fact, quite similar. Here are a few of the most obvious ones. Telescreens -- in the novel, nearly all public and private places have large TV screens that broadcast government propaganda , news and approved entertainment. But they are also two-way monitors that spy on citizens, private lives. Today websites like Facebook track our likes and dislikes, and governments and private individuals hack into our computers and find out what they want to know. Then there are the ever-present monitoring cameras that spy on the ordinary people as they go about their daily routine. The endless war -- In Orwell's book, there's global war that has been going on seemingly forever, and as the book's hero, Winston Smith, realizes the enemy keeps changing. One week we're at war with Eastasia and friends with Eurasia. The next week, it's just the opposite. There seems little to distinguish the two opponents, and they are used primarily to keep the people of Oceania, where Smith lives, in a constant state of fear, thereby making disagreement unthinkable -- or punishable. Today we have the so-called war on terror, with no end in sight, a generalized societal fear, suspensionof certain civil liberties, and an ill-defined enemy who could be anywhere, and anything. Newspeak -- the fictional, stripped-down English language, used to limit free thought. OMG (Oh my God), RU (Are you) serious? That's so FUBAR (Fucked Beyond Ail Recognition). LMAO (Laugh My Ass Off). Memory hole -- this is the machine used in the book to change or disappear embarrassing documents. Paper shredders had been invented, but were hardly used when Orwell wrote his book, and the concept of wiping out a hard drive was years in the future. But the memory hole foretold both technologies. So what's it all meant? In 1984, Winston Smith, after an intense round of ""behavioral modification"" -- read: torture-- learns to love Big Brother, and the difficult world he was born into. Jump forward to today, it seems we've willingly given up all sorts of freedoms, and much of our right to privacy. Fears of terrorism have a lot to do with this, but dizzying advances in technology, and the ubiquity of social media, play a big part. There are those who say that if you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to be afraid of. But the fact is, when a government agency can monitor everyone's phone calls, we have all become suspects. This is one of the most frightening aspects of our modem society. _ Unless you spend your life in a wilderness cabin, totally off the grid, there is simply no way the government won't have information about you stored away somewhere. What this means, unfortunately, is that we are all Winston Smith. And Big Brother is the modem surveillance state."	['Concerned.']
"The best title for the passage is "" _ ""."	"In Yemen, you always see one type of vehicle on the road: the water truck.They travel mountain roads and cross deserts to bring Yemenis the goods more valuable than oil.It is one that only the rich can afford, with the supply regularly being cut off.Others must rely on scarce rain or charity to fight thirst. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.""In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, "" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. ""There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,"" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food."

Young British people live in their parents' home until around 30 because _ .	The British aren't having as many children as they used to. One reason is that people are having children much older than before, meaning they have fewer years in which they can have them. After years at university, they need a few years of work experience before they can get the job they want. They might then get married, but it's incredibly expensive to buy a house in the UK. The above explains why young British people now don't move out of their parents' home until they are around 30 years old on average. It is not until they are 30 that they can afford their own home. Increasingly, it is not until that age that they can afford to get married and start a new life in a new home. It's only after this age that many young people start thinking about having a child. So a British person manages to get a job, get a home and get married. Why isn't he or she then having at least two children on average? The main reason is that it is quite expensive to bring up a child in the UK. Why is it expensive? Well, these days, both parents need to work just to pay for their home and living expenses. Because both parents are at work, that means they then need to pay someone to look after their child during the day. Paying for this childcare is nearly always expensive. The recent financial crisis is making things even harder for families, since unemployment is rising and even fewer people can afford to have children. With so much pressure on families, is it any surprise that the divorce rate is so high? So what is Britain doing to try and save the British family? The government is trying to make it cheaper to have children. For example, there have been increases in money families can claim from the state each month. Also, there are increasing government _ for nursery schools, so that parents do not need to pay so much for child care. The government is also trying to reduce the number of hours British parents have to work to earn enough money to pay their bills. If parents didn't have to work so many hours, they'd have more time to spend with their children and wouldn't need to spend so much on childcare. On average, a Briton works 49 hours a week, which is the most in Europe. The state is now considering introducing laws to encourage companies to improve their employees' work-life balance. Let's hope they're not too late to save the British family. Otherwise, the British will always be too tired, and won't have enough time and money, to have children.

The passage mainly tells us _ .	What's a good friend like? One may have different answers to this question at different ages. When he is very young, he may think a good friend must be together with him all day. And they can share everything together. If his friend doesn't give him food to eat once, he doesn't think they are good friends any more. But they will play together happily again very soon. When he grows older and studies in a middle school, his idea about a good friend changes. He thinks a good friend should be helpful and honest. A good friend should always help him with his lessons. A good friend should come to him when he is sad. And he is always ready to tell everything to his friend. If his friend tells others about his secrets, he may hate the friend. When he grows up, he may not think it's necessary for a good friend to be always honest. Everyone has his secrets. If the truth may hurt the friend, it's better to keep it secret from him than tell him about it. And he may think a good friend can give him some good advice when he has problems. He comes to understand that he shouldn't just ask friends for help and that he should also learn to do something for his friends.	['what a good friend means for a person at different ages']
The Star left London for _ .	"Holmes said, ""Somebody sent a letter with five pips in it from India, and arrived seven weeks later to kill John's uncle. Then they sent five pips from Scotland and arrived three days later to kill John's father. Now they have sent five pips to John from London!"" ""The letters are all from sea ports . The writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters,"" I replied. ""Very good, Watson! And John's enemy is in London already!"" ""Well, I hope they won't kill young John,"" I said. But they did. The next morning, we read in the newspaper that a policeman found him die near Waterloo station. Holmes was very angry about it. ""He came to me for help and those men murdered him! I'm going to find them, if it's the last thing I do!"" he said to me, and he hurried out of the house. At night, when he came back, he was tired, but pleased, he said, ""I know the names of John's enemies! And now I'm going to send them a surprise! This will frighten them!"" He took five pips from an orange and put them in an envelope . On it he wrote ""S. H. for _ "" ""I'm sending the pips to captain James Calhoun. His ship is called the Star. He and his men are sailing back to Georgia, USA."" ""How did you find him, Holmes?"" I asked. ""Ship's papers,"" he said, ""I've looked at hundreds of them today. Only one ship, the Star, was in the three ports at the right times, this morning the Star left London to sail back to Georgia. I found out that the captain and two of his men, all Americans, weren't on the ship last night, so I'm sure they killed John. When they arrive in America, they'll get the pips and then the police will catch them!"""	['America']
What is the best title for the passage?	"Last week, we explained that the planet Mars has passed ""opposition. ""It passed a point opposite the Sun. This week, we tell about the planet's surprising motion among the stars. For thousands of years, people have recognized that planets travel among the stars. The planets generally follow the path taken by the Sun through the sky. The Sun's path is called the ecliptic. The groups of stars along the ecliptic are called the Zodiac. The motion of the planets can be confusing at times. Everyone knows the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But this is caused by the turning motion of the Earth. Planets generally move from west to east. However, Mars will appear to move backward for about two months this year. This happens because the Earth is overtaking Mars on its way around the Sun. Mars began its backward, or westward, motion on May 11th, It will start moving eastward again on July 19th. Mars' apparent motion has been a mystery to astronomers for hundreds of years. Most early theories of the solar system argued that the Sun and planets turned around the Earth. But the sudden westward motion of Mars presented a problem. Why would Mars move west for two months when it nears ""opposition""? In 1543, a Polish church worker named Nicolas Copernicus published a different theory. His theory said the Earth and planets moved around the Sun in perfectly circular orbits. Copernicus' theory was simpler. But his Sun - centered system still did not explain the observed motion of Mars very well. Finally, a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler published a complete theory of the motion of the planets in 1619. He had carefully studied the motion of Mars for many years. Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets do not move in circular orbits around the sun. Instead, they travel in flattened orbits called ellipses. Mars' elliptical orbit is the cause of its unusual brightening this year and its apparent large size. During the next several weeks, you can see for yourself why the mysterious motion of Mars has caused so many people to wonder."	['The Surprising Motion of Mars']
Which son thought the tree was ugly?	"Many years ago, there was an old man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So he told them to go and look at a pear tree. It was far away from his home. The first son went in winter, the second in spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in autumn. When the sons came back, the old man asked them to say what they had seen. The first son complained the tree was ugly. The second son said the tree was covered with buds and full of hope. The third son said the tree was full of green leaves. They looked so beautiful, and it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen. The youngest son said that the tree was bowed down with heavy fruits. It was full of life and fulfillment . The man explained that all of his sons were right, but each of them had seen just one season of the tree. He told them that they couldn't judge a tree or a person by only one season. ""If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the hope of your spring, the beauty of your summer, and the fulfillment of your autumn."" said the old man. It is true that we shouldn't let the hard season break the happiness of the other seasons. Never give up during the difficult days and better times are sure to come some day."	['The first one.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"Winston Churchill was born into a famous family.His father was a successful politician.However, as a boy, Churchill was considered a slow learner in school.Later he entered the Army and saw action in various countries. In October 1900, Churchill began his political career.For the next sixty years Churchill's work as a great politician was both brighter and more difficult than his father's had been.In 1939 German attacked Poland.Churchill prepared to fight.In 1940 he became the Prime Minister of English. France fell.The Germans fought their way through Western Europe.It looked as if Britain was about to lose the war.Was it now possible to ask for peace, and listen to Hitler? Churchill spoke: ""I have nothing to offer but blood, hard work , tears and sweat... You ask what is our policy? I will tell you, it is to fight, by sea , by land and air, with all our force and with all the strength that God can give us.You ask what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory."" The Germans began moving their armies to the French coast and prepared to go to war with British.The British had not enough guns to go around.Churchill gave the answer: "" We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.We shall fight on the coast ; we shall fight on the landing grounds; we shall fight in the fields and in the streets; we shall fight in the hills; we shall never give up."" By his courage and hard work, Churchill _ his people and other nations fighting together against Hitler.Victory finally came when the Germans lost World War II. Churchill died in 1965 and was given a state funeral.This was a fitting payment to one of all the greatest men the world had ever seen."	['Churchill was not so clever as his father.']

According to the passage, what is the right attitude to mistakes?	When you make a mistake, big or small, cherish it like it's the most precious thing in the world, because in some ways, it is. Most of us feel bad when we make mistakes, beat ourselves up about it, feel like failures, get mad at ourselves. And that's only natural. Most of us have been taught from a young age that mistakes are bad, and we should try to avoid mistakes. We've been scolded when we make mistakes--at home, school and work. Maybe not always, but probably enough times to make feeling bad about mistakes an unconscious reaction. Yet without mistakes, we could not learn or grow. If you think about it that way, mistakes should be cherished and celebrated for being one of the most amazing things in the world. They make learning possible; they make growth and improvement possible. By trial and error--trying things, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes--we have figured out how to make electric light, to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, to fly. Mistakes make walking possible for the smallest _ , make speech possible, and make works of genius possible. Think about how we learn:We don't just consume information about something and instantly know it or know how to do it. You don't just read about painting,or writing,or computer programming,or baking, or playing the piano, and know how to do them right away. Instead, you get information about something, from reading or from another person or from observing usually...then you construct a model in your mind...then you test it out by trying it in the real world...then you make mistakes...then you revise the model based on the results of your real world experimentation...and repeat, making mistakes, learning from those mistakes, until you've pretty much learned how to do something. That's how we learn as babies and toddlers, and how we learn as adults. Mistakes are how we learn to do something new--because if you succeed at something, it's probably something you already knew how to do. You haven't really grown much from that success--at most it's the last step on your journey, not the whole journey. Most of the journey is made up of mistakes, if it's a good journey. So if you value learning,if you value growing and improving,then you should value mistakes. They are amazing things that make a world of brilliance possible.	['We should treat mistakes as good chances to learn.']
What is the main idea of the passage?	"Music is often thought of as ""easy"" or ""play time"", but it's not that at all. Music plays a very important part in our education. Students who learn music learn a lot of music history at school. This includes ""modes "",which were used in churches during the development of music. They are still used today. Students learn about the historical events that were taking place when the music they play was written. They learn what the music was used for. So much of our culture is in music and has been for centuries. Music also helps with science. Students use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't. Students also need science to understand something called the ""overtone series"", which is about how music is produced by vibration and why. Students learn a lot about languages. Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones. Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. Some songs are famous poems or short works set to music. Students learn a huge amount of coordination through music, so parts of the body can work better together. Students must use fine motor skills in order to play an instrument. Singers and players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play. Students learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important works of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music. Music education also brings higher thinking to our children. It allows them to think about complex patterns (How can I make my part sound better?How do this music and these different parts fit together?). Students have to know absolutely what every other musician does at all times. In that way, it develops teamwork. As one can see, music is very important to education besides bringing us fun."	['The importance of music education.']
The main idea of the whole passage is that _ .	The United States is one of the greatest fruit-growing countries in the world. Fine red apples come from Washington and New York. Golden oranges come from Southern California and Florida. Fruit grows in all parts of America. The kind of fruit that is grown depends on the weather in each place. Orange trees cannot be grown where temperatures drop below freezing. Southern California and Florida are far from each other, but their weather is much the same. They do not often have freezing temperatures. In Washington, apple trees are planted near the Atlantic Ocean. In New York, they grow near the Great Lakes. Apple trees are often planted near water. Water temperature changes more slowly than land temperature. Near water, temperature does not drop so fast. There is less chance of frost in late spring or early autumn. Frost can kill apples. America has many kinds of weather. It has many kinds of soil. Because of this, they grow and eat more fruit than any other country in the world.	['different fruits grow in different weather']
According to the passage, we know that _	Have you ever heard the story of the four-minute miles? Many years ago, people believed that it was impossible for a human Being to run a mile in less than four minutes until Roger Banister proved it wrong in 1954. What happens if you put an animal in a pond? Any animal, big or small, will swim its way through. What happens when someone, who doesn't know how to swim, falls in deep waters? They drown. If an animal who has not learnt swimming could escape by swimming, why not you? Because you believe you will drown while the animal doesn't. Have you ever wondered why the letters are organized in a particular order on your keyboard? You might have thought it is to increase the typing speed. Most people never question it. But the fact is that this system was developed to reduce the typing speed at a time when typewriter parts would jam if the operator typed too fast. These three cases show the power of our beliefs. There is no other more powerful directing force in human behavior than belief. Your beliefs have the power to create and to destroy. A belief delivers command to your nervous system. I used a snake in my workshops for children to show them how unrealistic some of their beliefs are. Students of a school in India, said snakes are slippery and slimy and poisonous. After doing an exercise for changing beliefs, they handled my snake and found it to be dry and clean. They also remembered that only three types of poisonous snakes exist in India. Did this story end the way you thought? Review your beliefs now and find out which ones you need to change?	['Roger Banister was the first person who ran a mile in less than four minutes.']
We can infer that warmer ocean temperatures _ .	"Although hurricane season doesn't begin until June 1, a Pacific storm has already struck. El Salvador, which was ruined by a Caribbean storm in 1995, was hit by Hurricane Adrian on Friday. This is the first Pacific-born hurricane to ever reach land in this Central American country. Some 14,000 people left from the western coast of El Salvador. The storm weakened as it crossed land, heading east. Heavy rains created deadly flooding problems in the hurricane' s wake. Adrian is the first Pacific storm of the season. It reported maximum continuous winds of 75 miles per hour, the minimum strength of a hurricane. A Category 3 hurricane, Adrian also caused damage and flooding in Honduras. It is expected to break up before reaching the Caribbean Sea on the eastern coast of Central America. Hurricane season typically begins June 1 and lasts through November 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted seven to nine hurricanes for the 2005 season. ""It is difficult to make any kind of an exact prediction of how many of these will strike land,"" NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said. He predicts two to three hurricanes will strike the U.S. this season. Last year, six of nine hurricanes reached Category 3 strength or higher. Four of those hit Florida within a six-week period. Altogether, Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne caused more than $40 billion in damage in the Sunshine State. This year' s forecast is based on ocean temperatures. Warmer temperatures produce more tropical storms, which can then turn into hurricanes. ""The issue, really, this year is the unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic,"" said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane Center."	['are mo re likely to cause the hurricanes']

Which statement is true?	"One day a man was walking in the street when he met a penguin .It was a handsome and very brave bird. It seemed to take an immediate liking to the man, because it walked up to him and then followed him wherever he went.This was funny for a while but in the end became rather embarrassing . ""Go away, you silly bird, ''the man said to the penguin, but the bird ignored him. It simply would not leave him alone.Wherever he went, the bird went too. At last, in desperation the man walked into a police station.""Excuse me, officer."" he said. ""I need some advice. I met this penguin in the street and I don't know what to do with it."" A bored policeman looked up from what he was writing and said, ""Just take it to the zoo, sir.'' ""Oh,all right.''said the man. The next day the man was walking along the street, still accompanied by the penguin, when he met the policeman he'd spoken to the day before.The policeman was not pleased to see them.""I thought I advised you to take that animal to the zoo, "" he said. ""Well, yes, officer, you did.And I did take him to the zoo, "" the man explained. ""And we had a great time. But we can't go to the zoo every day.I thought today I'd take him to the movies.''"

Where does lava come from?	Scientists have searched for many years for a method to tell whether a volcano explosion will be small or large. Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this. They did the research on Mount Unzen on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. Mount Unzen exploded in November, 1990. Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today. The scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones. The scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones. The scientists say if they had known this two years earlier, they could have warned the people living in the area near Mount Unzen and saved many lives.	['It is from deep part in the earth.']
What kind of animals can guard a house?	Can animals do work for us? Some scientists think that animals may do a lot of jobs. They say that we may see many elephants, monkeys, dogs, bears and other animals do a lot of things. Animals can get something to eat if they do some work for people. Some scientists say that many different animals may do lots of jobs if they know they will get something to eat. Of course, dogs can guard a house, and elephants can do some heavy jobs. And we can also teach animals to work in factories. In America apes can help people make cars. Scientists believe that these big monkeys may drive cars.	['A dog']
The theme of this article is .	According to the latest research in the United States,men and women talk such different languages that it is like people from two different cultures trying to communicate.Professor Deborah Tannen of Georgetown University has noticed the difference in the style of boys' and girls' conversations from an early age.She says that little girls' conversation is less definite than boys' and expresses more doubts.Little boys use conversations to establish status with their listeners. These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship. Some scientists who are studying speech think that the brain is pre-programmed for language.As we are usually taught to speak by women,it seems that the brain must have a sexual bias in its programming,otherwise male speech patterns would not arise at all.

What is the official suggestion of drinking alcohol?	"In Britain,it's bottoms up from the week before Christmas till the last firework explodes in the sky announcing the new year,.The last Friday before Christmas popularly known as'Mad Friday'--is one of the busiest periods for the country's pubs and clubs.

The charity Alcohol Concern is running a campaign of restriction by encouraging people to have a dry January. Jackie Ballard,the charity's Chief Executive,believes the campaign has been successful in recent years.She says:""More than two-thirds of people even six months later are drinking at reduced levels having had a month off drink.But also a study has shown the impact it has on people's health reducing their blood pressure and blood sugar levels."" The study by the University of Sussex followed up nearly 900 participants in Alcohol Concern's Dry January campaign and found out that 72%of them had kept harmful drinking sessions down and 4%were still not drinking. Moderation seems to be the key to everything.The official recommendation for women is not to regularly drink more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day.The limit for men is 3 to 4 units of alcohol--no more than a pint of 5.2%ABV lager,beer or cider."

What's the author's purpose of writing the passage?	"Before your child's final exam: and the graduation announcements, you face a significant task together: choosing the right college or university. There is no ""one size fits all"" approach to selecting a college--it's a very personal process for most teenagers. Consider a wide range of factors to help your child make the best possible choice.

Which of the following statements is not true about Dr Johnson's dictionary?	The first English dictionary was published in 1604. The dictionary was actually nothing more than a list of about 3, 000 difficult words, each followed by a one-word definition. The author, Robert Cawdrey, made no attempt to include everyday words in his dictionary. No one, he reasoned, would ever have to look up a word in a dictionary if he already knew the meaning of the word. During the 1600's more dictionaries were published. Each followed Cawdrey's lead and presented a few thousand hard words. Around 1700 one dictionary maker, John Kersey, did define easy words as well as hard words. But until the 1750's all the dictionaries were rather crude and not very valuable. A man named Dr Samuel Johnson changed all this. In 1755 Dr Johnson produced the first modern dictionary. He included in his dictionary all important words, both easy and hard, and he gave good meanings. He also gave good sentences to show how each word was actually used in speech and in writing. By the end of the 1700's most dictionary makers had followed Johnson's example. Dictionaries were getting better and better. The 1800's saw the greatest improvement in the quality of dictionaries. In England scholars planned and prepared the Oxford English Dictionary, a twenty-volume (;;) work. One of the most interesting features of the Oxford Dictionary is its word histories. It traces (;) the history of each word from its earliest recorded use up to the time of the printing of the dictionary.	['It was not very valuable.']
What can we infer from News 3?	Here is some news of the future. March 20. 2035 There was a lot of news around the life extension drugs that hit the market a decade ago. They didn't promise that you would live forever. but they gave you a chance to extend your life an extra five to ten years. Even though the life expectancy rate at birth has increased greatly. the life expectancy for seniors hasn't improved that much. Basically. you have a greater chance to become a senior, but you will not have a much longer lifespan, and this is where the anti-aging drugs intend to kick in. So ,do the anti-aging drugs work? Well. it is too early to tell. But the sales so far are very good. April 19, 2035 Of the total US population of 378 million, people over 65 years of age now make up 20% for the first time. The senior ratio was only 4.1% by year 1900. and l2.4% 30 years ago. The number of people above 65 compared to those of what is considered working ages. between 15 and 64. is currently 33.7%. This is up from l85% since year 2005. which means that for every retired person there are now two workers. compared to four workers 30 years ago.

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Can people change their skin color1 without suffering like pop king Michael Jackson? Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1. The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science. Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1. It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes. Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng. ""Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,"" said Cheng. The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin color1 without damaging it like chemical treatment did on Michael Jackson. ks5u"	['nowadays people who want to change their skin color1 have to suffer a lot from the damage caused by the chemical treatment']
What happened to the students after they read the list?	"One day, a teacher asked her students to list the names of their classmates on two pieces of paper, leaving a space after each name. Then she told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of them. That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the names and the words of each student on a separate piece of paper. On Monday she gave each student the list. Before long, the students were smiling. ""I never knew that I meant anything to anyone! And I didn't know others liked me so much."" most students said. No one ever mentioned anything about the paper in class again, but it didn't matter. The students were happy with themselves and one another. Several years later, one of the students, Mike would graduate from Harvard University and his teacher and some former classmates attended the commencement . Mike came up to her. ""I want to show you something,"" he said, taking a wallet out of his pocket. He carefully took out two pieces of notebook paper to the teacher without looking at the paper. ""Thank you so much for doing that."" Mike said. All of Mike's former classmates started to gather around. Charlie said, ""I put mine in my album."" I think we all treasured our lists.""

A student who likes reading about heroes will probably read _ .	"Once upon a time, a doting mother asked Albert Einstein what she should read to her son to help him grow up as brilliant and intelligent as the famous scientist. ""Fairy-tales,"" he said, wisely nodding his head. Why? Why would Albert Einstein -- the Nobel Prizes winning physicist recommend reading fairy-tales? Was he joking? All the evidence suggests he was deadly serious. He also said, ""When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than any talent for abstract, positive thinking."" Childhood is one of the factors that blur the distinctions between the self and other objects. Thus fantasy stories appeal to children and appear to make sense to them. There are several commonly accepted genres of fantasy, ""Animal Fantasy"" which centers around the lives of lovable talking animals and ""Modern Fantasy"" which focuses on adventures in other worlds and magical events. I am inclined to add a third genre ""Human and Animal Fantasy"", which mixes human and animal characters. Another genre of fantasy may be ""High Fantasy"" which features heroes who combat evil and save the world from destruction. Fantasy feeds a child's imagination and encourages creativity. The enjoyment that the genre engenders promotes reading and enhances literacy. Moreover, the fantasy genre may be used for teaching purposes. For example: A story about cruelty to animals would limit appeal to a child; however a fantasy celebration of closeness between the children and their pets may give an element of excitement as the children are able to save animals from someone with cruel intentions. Children love the Harry Potter series, and if they only see the movies they miss a great opportunity to develop their reading skills by spending time with the lovable young wizards and witches of the Hogwarts community."

According to the passage, how many calories does a man need a day on average?	"Inprefix = st1 /Chinahe's known as ""the Flying Fish""; inAmericathey call him ""the Baltimore Bulet"". Whatever you call him, American swimmer Michael Phelps looks destined to become a household name across the world after breaking the Olympic record for most gold medals in a single Games. Phelps's total of eight gold medals in Beijingput him one ahead of Mark Spitz's previous record set in 1972. Now people are already calling him the greatest Olympian of all time. But whether he is or not, what is it that makes Michael Phelps so good? A good place to start might be his physique . Phelps has the perfect body shape for a swimmer: his arm span is longer than his height, he has very flexible joints, huge lungs, and his incredibly large feet (size 14 in the US, size 49 inChina) act like flippers in the water. To feed his huge swimmer's body, Phelps eats an astonishing 12,000 calories a day, six times the average for a man of his age. He then owes it to a swimsuit which has been making waves in the world of swimming. Designed by NASA, the American space agency, the suit is made of a special material which is said to help athletes swim 2% faster. Michael Phelps should spare a thought for his mum, who first pushed him into swimming as a way of making friends, and who believed in him when one teacher said he would never be a success. Whatever the reason for his success, Phelps admits there was perhaps also a bit of luck involving in winning his eight medals. ""I guess eight is a lucky number for me, too, now. The opening ceremony started on 8/8/08. Maybe it was meant to be,"" he said."	['2,000']

Bees are hard to study because _ .	"All across California, honeybees are flying away from their hives and dying. Empty hives are causing a lot of worry about some important food crops. Bees give us a lot more than delicious honey. They are pollinators --they enable plants to produce the fruits and nuts we enjoy by carrying pollen from one plant or flower to the next. The wind pollinates oats, corn, and wheat, but many other plants (like apple and cherry trees and melon vines) depend on insects, bats, and birds. In the U.S., millions and millions of bees kept by human beekeepers fly around doing a lot of this important work for food crops. ""Bees are worth protecting because their work adds so much to our diet,"" says Dr. Jeff Pettis of the Bee Research Laboratory. California's almond crop alone depends on about half the bees in the country. But now the almond crop and many others could be in trouble with so many bees dying. Researchers at government and university labs all over the country are trying to figure out why so many bees are dying. However, bees are hard to study. Most die away from the hive, so researchers don't have dead bodies to examine. And when researchers return to a hive after two weeks, about half the bees they studied on their first visit will be dead, replaced by new ones in the natural life cycle of bees. ""It isn't like studying a large animal like a cow that doesn't move around much and is easy to find out in the cow field,"" says Pettis. Researchers have some ideas about what could be affecting bee health. They could be sick from poisons widely used to kill insects, or they might not be getting enough good food to stay strong. Also, tiny insects called mites feed on bees. ""A virus or bacteria could also be doing the killing."" explains Pettis."	['they move around too much']
We can infer from the passage that the birthplace of Sweetest Day is _ .	"Sweetest Day in America is always the third Saturday in October. This holiday is much more important in some regions than in others (Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo being the biggest Sweetest Day cities). It is a holiday that is gaining in popularity every year throughout the country. Sweetest Day is celebrated on the third Saturday in October as a day to make someone happy. It is an occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to remember not only the sick, aged, and orphaned, but also friends, relatives and associates whose helpfulness and kindness we have enjoyed. Over 60 years ago, a man in Cleveland, believing that the city's orphans and shutins too often felt forgotten and neglected, thought of the idea of showing them that they were remembered. He did this through the distribution of small gifts. With the help of his friends and neighbors, he distributed these small remembrances on a Saturday in October. During the years that followed, other Clevelanders began to participate in the celebration ceremony, which came to be called ""Sweetest Day"". In time, the Sweetest Day idea of spreading cheer to the underprivileged was broadened to include everyone, and became an occasion for remembering others with a kind act or a small remembrance. And soon the idea spread to other cities all over the country. Sweetest Day is not based on any single group's religious affection or on a family relationship. It is a reminder that a thoughtful word or deed enriches life and gives it meaning. Because for many people remembering takes the form of giftgiving, Sweetest Day offers us the opportunity to show others that we care, in a practical way."	['Cleveland']
There are _ people in this story.	"Blue Ocean Aquarium is a great place for families to take a holiday. Children love to see the sea animals and watch movies about sharks in it. Last Saturday morning, Mr Jackson took his wife and two little sons to the aquarium. At the ticket office, he asked, ""How much shall I pay to get in?"" The woman at the ticket office answered, ""The price is 20 dollars for each adult or any kid older than five. We let kids in free if they are five or younger. How old are your kids?"" Mr Jackson said, ""The older one is six and the younger one is thee. I think I must buy three tickets. "" The woman was surprised. She said, ""Sir, don't you want to save 20 dollars? If you tell me your older son is five, I won't know the difference. "" Mr Jackson said with a smile, ""Yes, that sounds right, but my kids will know the difference. "" From Mr Jackson' s story, we know _ is very important in the modem society. We should tell the truth to the people around us, especially to the kids."	['5']
Which statement is TRUE about Jack's first playing with a real electric guitar?	Since the invention of Guitar Hero and similar computer games, it is no longer necessary to imagine what it would be like to play along with the Beatles--you can come together with them in the virtual world. Bill Wyman, former bass player in the Rolling Stones, has pointed out that music video games discourage kids from learning to play real instruments. My own opinion suggest quite opposite. Last year, I bought Guitar Hero III for our 14-year-old son, Jack. Jack quickly mastered the process and entered an intense period of playing the game. A few months later, while I was away on tour, a couple of his friends came around with a real electric guitar. Playing Guitar Hero had taught them how to play along the track. Now they wanted to see if they could apply that to the real thing. Jack's friends taught him how to play along to his favorite songs using just his index finger on the bass string. He got it right away. Guitar Hero had helped him over the first difficulty for guitar players--how to strum the strings with one hand while making chord shapes with the other. He never plays Guitar Hero now, preferring to rock out in the garage with his mates. Despite my attempts at getting him to learn an instrument, it was Guitar Hero that taught him the basics of playing and built up his confidence to the extent that he was able to make a recognizable sound the first time he played it. So let's not complain about a game that encourages kids to become music fans and, in our son's case, gives them the basic skills needed to learn how to play guitar.	['He did it successfully.']
From the passage we can learn that _ .	"Extracurricular School Activities Many schools today provide various extracurricular activities. Some activities are before school, some are after school, and a few may even take place on weekends. Many parents like their children to take part in these activities. Yet some parents are still a little _ it. Actually, these activities have many advantages for students. It is a wise choice for parents to allow students to get involved in extracurricular activities at school. It can help students to develop many working skills, people skills, and more. When students get involved in extracurricular activities, they get involved in different interests. These activities allow them to develop various interests that they may have. It also helps to raise the self-esteem of students. Many students feel worthless or there is nothing they are good at. Everyone wants to find something that they are really good at, and extracurricular activities provide the opportunity for them. Students can also learn relationship skills. They need to get involved in social activities and learn how to act properly in social situations. These activities give them a chance outside of school to do this, while they are still supervised by adults. Of course, while there are many excellent benefits of extracurricular activities for students, you need to consider how much is too much. It can be a great choice to get involved in a few different activities, but too many activities can have negative effects. If students take part in too many activities, they often have problems in their studies. They may not get enough rest. They may not have time to relax. It's important for students to set some limits to extracurricular activities. Students can pick out a couple of their favorites and make sure they can handle them. Some kids feel like they have to take part in many activities to be a success, and this is not good to them. When students get involved in extracurricular activities, there are certainly excellent benefits that they'll enjoy. They are doing it for their future success. It's important that students don't try to ""do it all""."	['extracurricular activities are supervised by adults']
"Which of the following has the same meaning as the sentence""... reassuring those who might be anxious about the safety of the soon-to-be world's tallest building"""	"SHANGHAI--The Shanghai World Financial Centre will be the tallest land-mark in the world after its completion this century in Pudong, according to the project's Japanese investors. The building will be located in the prime Lujiazui Zone in Pudong , on a 30,000-square-metre site. The building was originally designed to be a 94-floor office tower with a height of 460 metres. The project broke ground in 1997 but was later halted as a result of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia. ""As the economy warms up, we are more confident about Shanghai and the whole prefix = st1 /Chinaand we are working hard to get the Project restarted as soon as possible,"" said Katsuyuki Takeuchi, vice-president and general manager of the Shanghai World Financial Centre Company. Its parent company, Japan-based Moil Building Co. Ltd, established the Shanghaisubsidiary as the operator responsible for this ambitious project. The design, which is undergoing revision in apian, will accommodate international high-tech businesses, department stores, art galleries, clubs and a five-star hotel. Unlike the gloomy economies of theUnited States, Europe andJapan,Chinaenjoys a strong growth with brighter prospects, Takeuchi said. More capital and businesses are expected to flow into Shanghai, which aims to become a world centre for trade and the financial industry--with Lujiazui as its showpiece. The layout of Luijiazui includes three tall buildings, one of which is the completed JinmaoTower, each rising above 400 metres, as designed by local government after holding an international design competition early last decade. Other buildings nearby fall in height gradually, creating a special shape against the skyline. The Shanghai World Financial Centre will be built as the peak of the mountain.

Are there many adults learning English in China?	Many students in China are learning English. Some of these students are small children. Others are teenagers . Many are adults . Some study at school, others learn by themselves. A few learn English language over the radio, on TV, or in the films. One must work hard to learn another language. Why do all these people want to learn English? It is difficult to answer that question. Many boys and girls learn English at school because it is one of their subjects. They study _ and maths and English. Some people learn English because it is useful for their work. Many people often learn English for their higher studies, because at college or university some of their books are in English.

Which sentence is NOT true?	"Father's Day is the third Sunday in June. It is a day to thank fathers. On that day, fathers usually receive greeting gifts and cards. On the cards, children will write, ""Thanks, father."" ""Best wishes for Father's Day"" and so on. Father's Day is also a day families get together at home as well as in the restaurants. Where does the idea for the holiday come from? We should thank an American. In 1909 she wrote letters to some important persons. In her letter she advised to make Father's Day on the third Sunday in June. In June in 1910, people celebrated the first Father's Day in Washington. People whose parents are dead often decorated their parents' graves with flowers on these days. These are days of family fun and creating good feelings and memories."

Why did Russia have so many fires in one month in 2010?	Today there are many fires than in the past. Over 100,000 wildfires burn each year in America. Russia has 20,000 to 35,000 wildfires every year. Australia has on average 60,000 each year. These fires destroy huge areas of forests and burn hundreds of homes. Many experts believe there are several reasons for this sudden increase in fires. The first reason is climate change. Recent weather has been warmer and drier. This leads to dangerous fire conditions. When lightening strikes ,dry grass easily catches fire. Hot winds add to the problem. The wind spreads a fire quickly. In 2010, Russia had the hottest and driest summer in a century. In just one month, 500 fires destroyed over 2,000 homes. Some people lost their lives. Traditional fire-fighting practices are another reason for the increase in fires. In America, firefighters used to quickly put out every fire. They didn't allow the grass and trees to burn. As a result, today many forests have thicker vegetation .Thicker vegetation means more fuel for fires. Also, without fires from time to time, forests become overcrowded and unhealthy. Some trees are dead. The dead wood then easily catches fire. So surprisingly, America has many more fires today partly because of its past fire-fighting practices. Scientists now understand that a fire can be a natural part of a healthy forest. As a result, countries like Australia allow more fires to burn naturally. Sometimes, fire fighters even start fires to get rid of dead wood. Of course, they carefully control the fires. The fire thins out old trees. This allows sunlight to reach the ground. As a result, fires help new trees to grow. Therefore, if a fire is not a serious threat to people, firefighters may let it burn naturally.	['Because it was unusually hot, dry and windy.']
It can be inferred that Colin's sister hoped that Colin would _ .	"There are many idioms in English. An idiom is a phrase that we can't understand from the meaning of each word. The following are some of them. As the crow flies When a bird flies from place to place, it takes the most direct route. But when people drive, they have to follow roads and often go farther. When people give a distance ""as the crow flies"", they mean the shortest distance between the two points, not the distance you would have to travel by following roads. As Dan and his mum drove along the river, they could see the beach on the opposite side. Dan asked ""How far is it to the beach?"" ""It's only about a quarter of a mile as the crow flies"" his mother said. Blow hot and cold In one of Aesop's Fables, a man blows on his fingers to warm them up and then blows on his soup to cool it down. In both cases, the man is opening his mouth, but what comes out is different. If a person says one thing and later says the opposite, we say that the person is blowing hot and cold. ""Is Felicia going to try out for the soccer team this year?"" Stacy asked. ""I don't know,"" Tricia replied."" Last week she was saying yes, but this week she's saying no. She's really blowing hot and cold."" Break the ice Nowadays people use the phrase to refer to ending an awkward silence by beginning a conversation. It was the first day of summer camp. The four girls began to make their beds in silence. None of the girls knew each other, and no one knew what to say. Finally, one of them broke the ice by saying"" Hey, where's everybody from?"" Bury the hatchet In native American culture, when two nations agreed to end their war, they buried the hatchet. So to bury the hatchet is to make peace with someone else.

Why will the White House visitor records be open to the public?	"WASHINGTON -- It is announced Friday that White House visitor records will be opened up on a regular basis for the first time in modern history, providing the public an unusually detailed look at who gets the opportunity to help shape American policy at the highest levels. ""Americans have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process,"" the president said in a written statement issued by the White House while he vacationed with his family at Camp David. By the end of the year, the White House will begin posting online every month the names of the people who visited in the last 90 to 120 days. Each person's full name will be listed, along with the date and time they entered and left and the name of the person they visited. About 70,000 to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, and the records will include tourists as well as people conducting business. The White House pointed out several exceptions to the policy: ""purely personal guests"" of the Obama family; those cases in which the disclosure of visitors' names ""would threaten national safety interests""; and those who come for ""particularly sensitive meetings,"" like candidates for a Supreme Court nomination . Officials said only a ""small number"" will fit in the latter category , and their names would eventually be disclosed after they are no longer secret, like after a nomination is publicly announced. Moreover, they said, the number of undisclosed visitors will be disclosed, to make clear how few they are."	['To let the public know who are influencing the policies.']
Project X is intended for helping the young African immigrants to _ .	"As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder. Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage. Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X. Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme. ""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities. One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti. Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."""	['overcome tough problems']
What is the main idea of this article?	"We always want to prepare ourselves to the changes we may face when we go to a different country. Well, I have to say that for me, even after living in the US for one year and a half, I am still not used to the changes of weather, or how to manage my money well. There are many things that can give us culture shocks, but it is up to us whether to make it a big shock or a small one. I know that changing schools was a big thing for me. It helped me to be stronger and open towards meeting new people. Sometimes it feels like everybody is already in a group. This makes it harder for someone else to go in. But, it is not that hard. Actually many people know that you are from another country. They feel curious about your ""history"", and would often think you are a different man. Another thing that can produce a shock to me is the sudden change of weather. During the last couple of days, there was an ice-snow storm. It was the biggest in 15 years in the state of Missouri. It was raining ice, really, and you could hear sounds outside the window like little pieces of rocks hitting it, of course it was the ice.

At this time of the year they admire the laziness of their European cousins, particularly the French. Studies show that the average American gets only four weeks of paid leave a year compared with seven for the French and eight for the German. In Paris many shops close down for August; in Washington, where the weather is really hot, they remain open, some for 24 hours a day. But when it comes to the young, the situation is just opposite. American children have it easier than most other children in the world, including the supposedly lazy European children. They have one of the shortest school years anywhere, a mere 180 days compared with an average of 195 for OECD countries and more than 200 for East Asian countries. German children spend 20 more days in school than American ones, and South Koreans over a month more. Over 12 years, a 15-day deficit means American children lose out on 180 days of school, equal to an entire year. Americans also divide up their school time strangely. They cram the school day into the morning and early afternoon, and close their schools for three months in the summer. The long summer vacation acts like a mental eraser, with the average child reportedly forgetting about a month's worth of instruction in many subjects and almost three times that in mathematics. American academics have invented a term for this phenomenon, ""summer learning loss"". It is leaving American children ill-equipped to compete. They usually perform poorly in international educational tests, coming behind Asian countries that spend less on education but work their children harder. California's state universities have to send over a third of their classes to take some extra courses in English and math."	['are usually considered to be lazy']

You should keep down next to the floor because _	Fire can be very dangerous. We should be careful with it. This is what to do in a fire: *Shout out.

There is less smoke down there, so it's easier to breathe and see where you are going. *Test the door. If the door is cool, open it carefully. If the door is hot, do not open it! Try to find a different way out. *Get out. Do not stop to pick up anything. A fire can become very big in a few seconds! *Don't use the lift.

According the passage, The Pines is a _ .	While in Banff, make time for a walk around town. A special treat is to go up the mountainside on the Banff Gondola for a surprising view of the valley below. Here is The Pines, whose cook has developed a special way of mixing foreign food such as caribou, wild boar, and reindeer with surprising sauces. Best time to visit is during the off-season, from early May to mid-June, or in October. This way you can avoid sharing the highway with mobile homes which can be pulled by cars. But whatever the season, take some lunch with you from Banff, because there are only a few food stops on the road. Forty minutes north of Banff, side by side with the Banff National Park, sits world-famous Lake Louise. This surprisingly small body of water is attractive with towering mountains around it. Glaciers, huge masses of ice, moving very slowly against rocks, produce what is called glacier rock flour, making its water dark to see. It is worth taking a walk around the grounds of the Chateau Lake Louise, another beauty, proud of its early 20th century history. Back on the road, and it's time to continue north past the astonishing Columbia Icefield, then turn off the highway and take the short road to the base of the Athabaska Glacier. You can rent ice cleats and do some climbing or do a more pleasant snowmobile tour. Either way, you can enjoy endless beautiful sights. Finally you'll reach Jasper, the usual turning around the place for the Banff-Jasper loop . It's worth riding the Jasper Skytram, and be sure to visit the wonderful Jasper Park Lodge, also dating back to the 1920s. If you can have lunch there, do it. The restaurant has an adventurous menu and their wine list would put a smile on any visitor's face.	['restaurant where you can ask for some special kinds of food']
If there are 30 lost wallets with a photograph of a cute baby, how many of them will probably be returned?	"If you lose your wallet, how often do you think someone will be kind enough to return it to you, with cash and credit cards? Some people may be greedy, and others are simply too lazy to bother with the trip to the post office to send back a wallet to a stranger. But according to a psychology study by Dr. Richard Wiseman, there's one thing that'll greatly increase your odds of being reunited with a lost wallet: a photograph of a cute baby. In the study, hundreds of wallets were scattered around the streets of Edinburgh, Scotland. The psychologists wanted to see how many strangers would take the trouble to return them to the addresses listed on the drivers' licenses inside--but more than that, they wanted to find out what would make a person more likely to help out a stranger. To finish this, they included personal things in most of the wallets: some included a photo of a happy elderly couple, some contained a cute puppy, some contained a family portrait, and some held a photo of a lovely baby. Others had receipts showing that the wallet's owner had recently donated to a charity . Some contained no personal details. As the psychologists soon discovered, the sight of a smiling baby is enough to warm nearly any heart: only one in ten of the strangers who _ such wallets did not return them. In contrast, the second most successful image, the puppy, had a 53% return rate. When the wallet included no photograph, it stood only a one in seven chance of being returned to the owner. The success of the baby photograph shows a human compassion for the young that's been passed down through the ages, according to Dr. Wiseman. ""The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people, which is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective ,"" he told theTimes. To ensure our species' survival, scientists think that we must feel empathy and compassion for our young. Scientists say that this study supports the argument that we won't feel compassion only for our own babies, but for any that we see--hence, the strong desire a stranger would feel to return a wallet to the baby's parent. On a more basic level, the study also provides a great tip to help ensure that if your wallet is ever lost, you're more likely to get it back. ""If you want to increase the chances of your wallet being returned if lost, gain a photograph of the cutest baby you can find and ensure that it is clearly displayed,"" said Dr. Wiseman."

If a person lives from hand to mouth, he must be very _ .	"People use their mouths for many things. They eat, talk, shout and sing. They smile and they kiss. In the English language, the word ""mouth"" has many meanings. But some of them are not so nice. For example, if you say bad things about a person, the person might protest and say ""Do not bad mouth me."" Sometimes, people say something to a friend or family member that they later regret because it hurts that person's feelings. Or they tell the person something they were not supposed to tell. The speaker might say, ""I really put my foot in my mouth this time."" In other words, he might feel sad for saying the wrong thing. Sometimes when one person is speaking, he says the same thing that his friend was going to say. When this happens, the friend might say, ""You took the words right out of my mouth!"" Some people have lots of money because they were born in a very rich family. There is an expression for this, too. You might say such a person ""was born with a silver spoon in his mouth."" This rich person is the opposite of a person who lives ""from hand to mouth."" This person is very poor and only has enough money for the most important things in life, like food. ,."	['poor']
Which of the following CANNOT be used to describe Hillary Kinsey's feelings about studying abroad?	"Each year about a quarter of a million Americans study abroad. For many of them, a summer or a semester in a foreign country now involves more than just sitting in classrooms and hanging out with other American students. Instead, they are encouraged and sometimes required to be involved in the local communities they are studying in. ""It's ly important that they know something about how people in other parts of the world live and think, and how they behave,"" says William Finlay, head of the sociology department at the University of Georgia. In 2008, he co-founded a study abroad program with South Africa's Stellenbosch University. It combines traditional academic in-class learning with community involvement. ""We've been working with a non-government organization in the township. Our students typically either work with little children in day care centers or work in the library and teach very basic computer skills to young children,"" says Finlay. The three-week program proved to be an unforgettable experience for Hillary Kinsey. She says, ""It was interesting to learn the history of the area and then talk to these people and see what the social dynamics were, and how certain groups felt about other groups."" When Hillary Kinsey returned home from South Africa, she and other students in the program established a non-profit group. Kinsey says the group wants to contribute to advancing education and development in South Africa. ""One of the purposes of the group is that we hope to raise money and awareness about the situation where those people live and help to promote any sort of educational development that we can, "" Kinsey added. While many study abroad programs focus on helping Americans to learn foreign languages, others take a more intensive approach. ""In all of our locations, we place students with local roommates,"" says Mark Lenhart, director of CEF Academic Programs, which sends more than a thousand students to China, Korea and other countries each year. He says American students benefit from such one-on-one interactions, in spite of the challenges they face. Lenhart says, ""They have to adjust to the local life. This will enable students to become more employable when they graduate."""	['Surprised.']
When your waist size becomes larger than the figures given in the text, _ .	Take control of your health by learning these four numbers. They'll help with everything from losing weight to protecting your heart. Your daily calorie needs This is not technically a measurement, but it can have a huge influence on your health. Most women need 2,000 calories a day for good health, and men generally need about 2,550. One way to work out your daily calorie needs is to multiply your weight in pounds by 13 to 15, depending on your activity level. But roughly, that's 300 to 400 calories for breakfast, 500 to 600 for lunch, and 600 to 700 for dinner. Trying to lose weight? Eat about 500 calories less. Your waist size Waist size is one of the best ways to measure whether your weight is affecting your heart health. When body fat is packed into your abdomen ,your risk of heart attack increases. For women, health risk begins to rise when your waist is more than 35 inches. For men, risk increases with a measurement when your waist is over 40 inches. Your blood pressure Blood pressure rises and falls normally during the day. When it remains high, you have high blood pressure and this carries a higher risk or heart disease and stroke. A reading of 140/90 mm Hg or more is considered high, and if it's between 120/80 and 139/89, you may still be at risk and should be taking steps to prevent the development of high blood pressure. Your morning pulse rate Your pulse rate is the number of times your heart beats in one minute. A normal resting pulse rate is 60 to 90 beats per minute. People who are fit tend to have lower resting pulse rates because their heart muscles are in good shape. But if you don't exercise regularly and your heart rate is lower than the normal range, tell your doctor--it could be a sign of heart disease.	['the chance of heart disease rises']
In the first sentence of the passage, the writer implies that _ .	"The HOPE IS A GAME--CHANGER PROJECT will deliver unbreakable soccer balls to kids who, all too often, see things horrible, broken and not survive the simplest of circumstances. The project started taking form well before anyone knew where it would lead -which is to test the power of like-minded people working together to turn inspiration into action. Four years ago Bobby was in Rwanda offering help to the people there and taking photos of a child soldier named Moise with his ""soccer ball"",which was a pile of rubbish tied together with a string. This ""ball"" was the only thing Moise could call his own --- no family, no home, no place to go. Forced to fight in the Congo and having killed three people at the unbearably young age of seven, the boy's spirit was broken. And Bobby knew, as he took one photo after the next, that he'd never forget him. In fact, he returned the following year to tell Moise he had stayed deep within his heart ---but he was gone. I recently helped Bobby launch his new bookThe Power of the Invisible Sunwhich features a photo of Moise, his ball, and kids from war-torn areas around the world. All of his earnings go towards the HOPE IS A GAME-CHANGER PROJECT for the kids he visited over the past decade. They caught the emotional landscape from heartbreak to joy, but share the undeniable longing for recovery and hope. Bobby and I share the unchangeable belief that delivering hope is really a game-changer, especially to a child. We believe that each indestructible ball will come to represent a lasting symbol of hope. A light no matter how small---The Power of the Invisible Sun. This holiday season, I ask you to think about whether you are doing enough to help someone else in the world. Or as Bobby likes to put it, consider _ , which added together, can create transformational change. It's my great hope that the HOPE IS A GAME-CHANGER PROJECT will change the lives of children the world over --- one book, one ball at a time."	['kids live an unsafe life in parts of the world']
Mirna Hazim called her brother one night when _ .	Alejandra Pachecho:No. Why not?That is because in this world some people drive very crazily. So most people who use cell phones to talk in the car usually pay more attention to what they are talking about than to driving. One of the reasons that I feel this way is that my friend had a car accident while using a cell phone. He lost his life and his friends did, too. Rodrigo Cruz:That depends. The advantages of using a cell phone while driving are that you can call the police if there is a car accident, call for help when somebody's car breaks down, and call when somebody needs something before arriving home or at the office. The disadvantage is that people get distracted when they are driving at the same time they are talking on a cell phone. It can cause car accidents. Carl Khalid:No. I would recommend if you want to use a cell phone while you're driving, pull over and take your time. You will avoid a lot of trouble. There are many advantages of using cell phones in cars. In emergencies such as accidents, a flat tire or engine problem, the cell phone is useful for calling 911 for help. Using the cell phone while driving can save time, but using it while driving can also cause a lot of problems such as missing a red light or signs, not watching cars, or not paying attention to the speed limit. It causes a lot of problems. All these problems could cause loss of concentration. Mirna Hazim:Yes. A cell phone is helpful; it is one of the most important communication devices. For example, if you want to talk with somebody for an important reason, you can. One time when I was coming back from work at 10 o'clock at night, I had a problem in my car. It wouldn't move. I was scared to go into a store to call my brother because I didn't know the places there. I thought it could be dangerous. That night I found out that owning a cell phone is important.

According to the text, which of the following statements is TRUE?	"Nearly a quarter-century after a German boy threw a message in a bottle off a ship in the Baltic Sea, he's received an answer. A 13-year-old Russian, Daniil Korotkikh, was walking with his parents on a beach when he saw something lying in the sand. ""I saw that bottle and it looked interesting,"" Korotkikh told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ""it looked like a German beer bottle and there was a message inside. "" It said, ""My name is Frank, and I'm five years old. My dad and I are traveling on a ship to Denmark. If you find this letter, please write back to me, and I will write back to you."" The letter, dated 1987, included an address in the town of Coesfeld. The boy in the letter, Frank Uesbeck, is now 29. His parents still live at the letter's address. The Russian boy and the German man met each other earlier this month through an internet video link. The Russian boy said he did not believe that the bottle actually spent 24 years in the sea. He believed it had been hidden under the sand where he found it for a long time. Uesbeck was especially happy that he was able to have a positive effect on a life of a young person far away from Germany. ""It's really a wonderful story,"" he said. ""And who knows? Perhaps one day we will actually be able to arrange a meeting in person. """	['Daniil Korotkikh and Frank Uesbeck have got in touch with each other.']
The ban on all cellphone use by drivers was put forward _ .	"A federal agency on Tuesday called for a ban on all cellphone use by drivers -- the most far-reaching recommendation up to now -- saying its decision was based on a decade of investigations into distraction-related accidents, as well as growing concerns that powerful mobile devices are giving drivers even more reasons to look away from the road. As part of its recommendation, the National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to ban drivers from using hands-free devices, including wireless headsets. No state now has made laws to ban such activity, but the Board said that drivers faced serious risks from talking on wireless headsets, just as they do by taking a hand off the wheel to hold a phone to their ears. However, the concern was heightened by increasingly powerful phones that people can use to send e-mails, watch movies and play games. ""Every year, new devices are being on sale."" she said. ""People are attracted to update their Facebook page, to play music with cellphone, as if sitting at a desk. But they are driving a car."" The agency based its recommendation on evidence from its investigation of numerous crashes in which electronic distraction was a major contributing factor. Ms. Hersman said she understood that this recommendation would be unwelcome in some circles, given the number of drivers who talk and text. But she compared distracted driving to drunken driving and even smoking, which required wholesale cultural shifts to change behavior. ""It's going to be very unpopular with some people."" she said. ""We're not here to win a popularity contest. We're here to do the right thing. This is a difficult recommendation, but it's the right recommendation and it is time."" The agency's recommendation is not required for states to adopt such a ban. And it won't likely be agreed upon by state lawmakers who are unwillingly to anger those who have grown accustomed to using their device behind the wheel. The ban also deserves attention because it is the first call by a federal agency to end the practice completely, rather than the partial ban that some lawmakers have put in place by allowing hands-free talking."

Which year was the most critical to her career and life?	"Mary Cassatt is one of the first great women American painters. At first her father did not want her to become an artist. But she followed her dreams and became an artist.She was born on May 22, 1844, and lived in Europe for several years as a child. Her family returned to the United States and, at age 16, Mary attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Four years later she decided she couldn't learn anything fresh and practical in Philadelphia, so she returned to Europe. There she studied the skills of the masters in Rome, Seville, Antwerp, and Paris. Mary received the chance of a lifetime at the age of 33 when the famous French painter, Edgar Degas, asked her to join a group of painters that included now-famous artists like Manet and Renoir. Their style of painting is called Impressionism. They used primary colors and short brush strokes in their work. They recognized Mary 's spirit and powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows. Mary painted what she saw: gardens, and paintings of persons , especially of mothers and children involved in everyday living. One of her paintings, ""Young Mother and Two Children,"" was given to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today. Mary never married and, in 1877, her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her. Mary devoted much of her time to them for the next 18 years to their care. Mary painted until 1914 when her failing eyesight made it impossible to continue. She spent the later years of her life in Paris. She died in 1926 at the age of 82. Unfortunately,all her life, she refused to accept students."	['1877']

Who did the girl clean the shoes for?	"Today, I felt terrible. My head was full of problems and confusion . I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where to go. The most special thing happened when I was out for this walk. I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least 70 years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me. Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, ""Grandfather, may I polish your shoes?"" That old man took pity on her, smiled and gave her a shoe to polish. The girl told him she needed money to buy her brother a new school uniform. ""Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a uniform."" Then they walked to a market , and he bought her brother a uniform. The girl said ""thanks"" to him and left, leaving the old man smiling. He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, ""You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!"" As I walked away, I looked back and I could see him still smiling. I was blown away by the kindness I had just seen. Someone who had so little was so generous! Amazing! My own sadness had completely disappeared, chased way by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation of what I have by following the example of the old man. He only had a little, but shared it so beautifully with someone who had nothing."	['the old man']

What is the text mainly about?	"Have you ever had a doctor write you a prescription for three laps around a local trail ? How about a prescription for sit-ups? These treatments may not be as typical as the drugs that are usually used to treat our problems, but maybe they should be: a new report shows that regular exercise can be just as effective as prescription drugs for patients with depression and anxiety. ""Individuals who exercise report fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, and lower levels of stress and anger, "" said the paper's co-author, Jasper Smith, director of the Anxiety Research and Treatment Program at Southern Methodist University. "" Exercise may help patients with depression re-establish positive behaviors. For patients with anxiety disorders, exercise reduces their fears of fear and related bodily sensations such as a racing heart and rapid breathing."" In a separate study, published in Physical Therapy journal, scientists studied 161 women who' d recently given birth to babies, and decided them into two groups. New mothers tend to develop post-partum depression , and the scientists wanted to find out whether exercise could prevent such problems. One group of women was given specialized exercises as part of an eight-week parenting education program, while the other was given only written education. The physical element seemed to do the trick; the researchers report that the number of women identified as ""at risk"" for post-partum depression was reduced by half in the exercising group. Another recent study shows that even when a patient has a chronic illness like cancer or a heart condition, regular exercise can dramatically increase wellbeing by reducing anxiety. Researchers from University of Georgia analyzed 40 clinical trials involving almost 3,000 patients, and found that the patients who reported exercising regularly had a 20% reduction in symptoms of anxiety compared to those who didn't exercise. As a result, they were more likely to follow their recommended treatment plan. Of course, there are still some situations where prescription drugs are necessary, and we recommend you leave it to your doctor to determine when that may be. But in many cases, the best medicine may simply be to get up off the couch and go for a walk."	['Regular exercise can reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety.']
What can we learn about the invention of Wu Chenghua from the passage?	"With the press of a button, a person with severe spinal cord injuiy is able to walk again, thanks to the Walking Assistive Exoskeleton Robot (WAER). Powered suits that could help paralyzed people walk and others lift and carry heavy loads with ease have been a dream since late 19th century. But they can realize their dreams in the 21st century. The 20-kilogram robot has four battery-powered motors that can run for up to three hours. Inventor Wu Chenghua, from Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute, says it has successfully been in tests on 12 patients. ""We have learned from our research process that patients whose injuries are below the fourth chest joint are able to use our robot to stand, walk and sit down,"" he said. Since walking contributes to muscle exercise, Wu says patients receive some additional benefits. ""In the clinical process, we would check their bone mineral density ,and we found that the bone mineral densities of these patients had been improved."" he said. Wu says his exoskeleton may be available for consumers by 2018.

According to the research, if you want to be happy, you'd better have more _ .	"Happiness is _ , researchers reported on Thursday. The more happy people you know, the more likely you are yourself to be happy. And getting connected to happy people improves a person's own happiness. Researchers have been analyzing a collection of facts from tracking sheets dating back to 1971, following births, marriages, deaths, and divorces. Volunteers also listed the information of their closest friends, co-workers, and neighbors. They assessed happiness with a simple, four-question test. ""People are asked how often during the past week, one, I enjoyed life, two, I was happy, three, I felt hopeful about the future, and four, I felt that I was just as good as other people,"" Fowler said. The 60 percent of people who scored highly on all four questions were regarded as happy, while the rest were considered unhappy. People with the most social connections -- friends, spouses , neighbors, s -- were also the happiest, the data showed. ""Each additional happy person makes you happier,"" Christakis said. And happiness is more infectious than unhappiness, they discovered. If a social contact is happy, it increases the possibility that you are happy by 15 percent. A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent. A happy third-degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent. But every extra unhappy friend increases the possibility that you'll be unhappy by only 7 percent. The finding is interesting and useful. Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced death rate, pain reduction, and improved heart function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to promote a healthier society. Other data suggested having extra $5,000 increases a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent. A happy friend is worth about $40,000."	['social connections']
In the text, Dr. Robert Cantu expressed his concern about _ .	"The nation's largest group of pediatricians on Monday urged its members to ""firmly oppose boxing for any child or adolescent."" In a statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said thousands of boys and girls take part in the sport in North America, despite risks of serious brain and facial injuries. The group's position was approved by some experts. ""There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,"" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries. "" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing."" He said. According to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade. Pat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students. "" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,"" Russo said. ""Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble."" Dr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids. "" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,"" he said. ""For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,"" said Cantu. "" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live. They are far safer in the ring , even taking blows to the head, than they are out in the neighborhood."""

The author writes this passage to introduce the fact that _ .	Every year in America, high-school students who want to go to college take a national examination called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT in a shortened way. Their score is an important factor in determining which colleges will admit them or whether any will be admitted at all. The Scholastic Aptitude Test measures one's mathematical ability and use of the English language. Traditionally, the English portion involved grammatical questions and paragraphs that test reading comprehension. But the SAT folks have added a single question, to be answered in an essay, hand-written on the spot. That's an interesting way to test writing ability, put content aside, have you ever seen young people's handwriting lately? Or anyone's for that matter, in this age of computer keyboards? Students write numbers and sign their names on bank checks. They _ class notes in what can generously be described as the written word. And they hand-write, or more often print, a word or two of identification on luggage and lunch bags. Otherwise penmanship -- once taught so morally and easefully by second-grade teachers, has gone the way of the dodo bird which has died out. Yet today's kids are asked to write, thoughtfully and legibly , for several minutes on this SAT Test. Good luck to the text scorers who must work out difficultly the scrawl of young people who've been typing on computers since the age of three! Teachers insist that good handwriting can not only help one's score on the SAT, but also, later on in life, impress potential employers and earn bigger tax refunds because the tax inspectors can actually read the computations . And don't forget, we all have to turn to handwriting from time to time, as computers go down when power goes out.	['students should practice handwriting more often']
What does the passage mainly tell us?	Reading is a good hobby for all kinds of reasons. First, reading is fun. You can always keep yourself happy if you like reading.

What do you think of the Masai ?	"At the beginning of the 20th century there were more than a million lions worldwide. Today there are less than 30,000 in the wild. The remaining lions are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, hunting and activities to protect farms and cattle. For generations, Masai tribesmen on the large African plains in southeastern Kenya have hunted lions -- to protect their farms and cattle. Today they celebrate the lions' life. Noah is an elder in the Masai community. ""We have decided as a community of the Masai to lay down our spears, and there will be no more killing of lions in our community."" He is part of a group of Masai visiting the United States promoting the Predator Compensation Program. Conservation International's Frank Hawkins explains, ""The Masai have been living with wildlife for many generations and it has been a conflicting ( ) relationship in many ways. They compete with the animals for food as lions eat their cattle. We're trying to find ways in which the wildlife will become something useful to them."" They had the Predator Compensation Fund founded in 2003. After much discussion, a group of Masai farmers agreed to protect lions. In turn, if lions or other predators kill their cattle, the Masai owner will be paid market value for the dead animals from the fund. One man said that in the past, when a lion killed cattle, they killed it immediately. And now, after the start of the program, the Masai see the lion population growing. Since 2003, only four lions have been killed here."	['Wise.']
Which of the following was NOT written by Fitzgerald?	"When people think of Hollywood, they think of the city where dreams come true. This did not apply to F. Scott Fitzgerald, a screenwriter who had his share of ups and downs in this land. Fitzgerald was not a successful Hollywood writer because he was not good at the career path he chose. He was an amazing novelist, but his efforts of turning them into screenplays ended in disappointment and confusion. It was because of a lack of potential for screenwriting as well as his addiction and desire to be famous. Growing up as a boy, Fitzgerald went to movies a lot. He wanted to write stories that would eventually turn into movies. The problem was: just because Fitzgerald wanted to do something didn't necessarily mean that he was good at it. He made his attempts, but most of these efforts ended in disappointment because he thought about the change from script to screen too much. His plot was too detailed and complicated; his tone was too serious or his dialogue too sentimental . Fitzgerald's quick rise to fame also led to his fall. In life, things are not meant to happen all at once, all that the same time but it did for Fitzgerald. At his best time, three of his early stories were made into short films, including The Great Gatsby and Babylon Revisited. As the twenties approached, he was gradually forgotten by the reading public. He became drunk and constantly took pills both to sleep and wake up. His marriage was destroyed and his wife broke down mentally. He seemed unsure about his life. Fitzgerald had another chance at success when many opportunities came his way, including revisions of Emlyn William's play The Light of Heart and production of one of his own scripts, Cosmopolitan. However, these were all put aside and he was right back where he started, left behind and called a ""ruined man"". Fitzgerald simply wanted too much in his life. He wanted ""to be both a great novelist and a Hollywood success, to write songs like Cole Porter and poetry like John Keats"". His addiction to fame held him back and led to his failure as a Hollywood writer."	['The Light of Heart']
Where does she now think her feeling of unhappiness came from?	When I was 16 years old, a boy gave me an important gift. It was a smile. It was the early autumn of my first year at a junior high school, and my old school was far away. As a result, no one knew who I was. I was very lonely, and afraid to make friends with anyone. Every time I heard the other students talking and laughing, I felt my heart break. I couldn't talk about anyone with my problems. And I didn't want my parents to worry about me. Then one day, my classmates talked happily with their friends, but I sat at my desk unhappily as usual. At that moment, a boy entered the classroom. I didn't know who he was. He passed me and then turned back. He looked at me, without a word, a smile. Suddenly, I felt the touch of something bright and friendly. It made me feel happy, lively and warm. That smile changed my life. I started to talk with other students and made friends. Day by day, I became closer to everyone in my class. The boy with the lucky smile has become my best friend now. One day I asked him why he smiled, but he couldn't remember smiling at me!It doesn't matter because all the dark days have gone. I believe that the world is what you think it is. If you think it lonely, you might always be alone. So smile at world and it will smile back.	['From herself']

The letter before the. P. S. was _ .	Sarah Williams went to a boarding school. Here is one of the letters she wrote to her parents from the school. Wentworth Girls' School Beachside July 20th Dearest Mom and Dad, I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer. The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed. This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all. As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away. Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire. There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning. The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital. The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars. I'm very sorry about this. Much love, Sarah P. S. None of the above is true, but I have failed my exams. I just want you to know how bad things could have been!	['completely untrue']
According to the author, once the Indians moved into square houses, _ .	"I came to live here where I am now between Wounded Knee Greek and Grass Greek. Others came too, and we made these little grey houses of logs that you see, and they are square. It is a bad way to live, for there can be no power in a square. You have noticed that everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything tries to be round. In the old days when we were strong and happy people, all our power came to us from the respectful circle of the nation, and so long as the circle was unbroken, the people were getting rich. The flowering tree was the living center of the circle, and the circle of the four quarters nursed it. The east gave peace and light, the south gave warmth, the west gave rain, and the north with its cold and strong wind gave strength and continuous power. This knowledge came to us from the outer world with our brief. Everything the Power of the World does is done in a circle. The sky is round, and I have heard that the earth is round like a ball, and so are all the stars. Birds make their nests in circle, for theirs are the same as ours. The sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle. The moon does the same, and both are round. Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves. Our places were like the nests of birds, and these were always set in a circle, the nation's circle, a nest of many nests, where the Great Spirit meant for us to nurse our children. But the ""white people"" have put us in these square boxes. Our power is gone and we are dying, for the power is not in us any more. You can look at our boys and see how it is with us. Where we were living by the power of the circle in the way we should, boys were men at twelve or thirteen years of age. But now it takes them very much longer to grow up."

Why is Mrs. Reed bitter towards Jane?	Jane arrives at Thornfield, having been met at the George Inn. Mrs. Fairfax confuses her a little at first, because _ is so informal and welcoming. But in due course Jane discovers that Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. Jane's pupil, Adele Varens, is the eight-year-old French child under the legal protection of Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner of the house. (We learn later that her mother had claimed she was his illegitimate daughter. Mr. Rochester is not convinced by this claim, but felt he could not leave the little girl poor when her mother died.) Adele is a pleasant little girl, even if she is not a particularly eager student. Life goes on very peacefully for three months, until the return of Mr. Rochester. Jane first meets him on his horse, and her description of him is quite fanciful. He takes a fall and Jane helps him, although she does not know who he is until they are both back at Thornfield. It is obvious to the reader, although not to Jane, that the reason why Mr. Rochester stays at Thornfield much longer than usual is that he finds her company enjoyable. Jane, unknowingly at first, falls in love with him. Their closeness is very apparent. There is something about Thornfield that is mysterious. Jane is encouraged to focus her attention on the servant Grace Poole, who is Mr. Rochester's mad wife Bertha Mason's keeper at Thornfield, and whose drunken carelessness frequently allows Bertha to escape and do something violent. It is clear to the reader, though, that Mr. Rochester's emotional engagement is immense. When his bed is set on fire, Jane rescues him, but does not understand why the matter is not pursued, despite Mr. Rochester assuring her the criminal is Grace. The next morning Grace behaves as though she has done nothing wrong. Eventually, Mr. Rochester leaves, to go to a house party. He brings everyone at the party back with him, transforming the atmosphere in the house, and delighting Adele. One of the guests is Blanche Ingram, whom Mr. Rochester is confidently expected to marry. However, it is clear from the way she is portrayed in the book that she is too proud; our sympathies are not with her. Mr. Rochester is called away from the house, and when he returns he chooses to play the role of a fortune teller. It is clear to the reader that one of his motives is to try to turn Blanche against the idea of marriage to him. While he has clearly bothered her, he is unsuccessful. One afternoon, Jane hears that her cousin John Reed is dead and Mrs. Reed, who is probably on her deathbed, has been asking for her. With strict instructions from Mr. Rochester to return quickly, she sets off to Gateshead. On arrival, she realizes she no longer hates her cousins. However, Mrs. Reed is still bitter towards her, owing to the fact that Jane's mother was Mr Reed's favourite sister and this resulted in him apparently favouring Jane over his own children. A short time later, Mrs. Reed gives Jane a letter from her uncle, John Eyre, that was written three years earlier. It explains how he planned to adopt Jane and allow her to inherit his fortune. Mrs. Reed never handed the letter over because of her bitterness. Jane tries once more to seek reconciliation , but without success; her aunt dies that night.	['Because Mr. Reed loved Jane more than his own children.']
The writer's team learned a lot from the game. They got to know how to _ .	We were going to play against a team from a country school. They didn't come until the last minute. They looked worse than we had thought. They were wearing dirty blue trousers and looked like farm boys. We sat down for a rest. We felt that we didn't need any practice against a team like that. The game began. One of us got the ball and he shot a long pass to our forward . From out of nowhere a boy in an old T-shirt stopped the ball and with beautiful style he shot and got two points. Then another two points in a minute. Soon the game was all over. We were beaten by the country team. After that, we thought a lot. We certainly learned that even though your team is very good, you can't look down upon the others and still need to do you best. And the most important lesson we learned was: One can't judge a person or a team only by their clothes.	['do better from then on']

Bonnie Riggs,a restaurant expert with NPD has studied Americans'restaurant habits for almost 30 years.She says one reason why Americans like fast casual food is that it's new.It is creative,it is something different and people like to try new things.Her study shows Americans made 61 billion visits to restaurants last year.Three out of four visits were to fast food restaurants,like McDonald's.Fast casual is still a small percentage of restaurant visits,but it has developed fast.Just as Ms.Riggs says,""It's growing by _ ,because they meet consumers'needs.They know it's being prepared while they wait,it's fresh,quality food,good tasting food at what they say are reasonable and affordable prices.""

From the passage we can infer that in the US schools _ .	"More than 6,000 children were expelled from US school last year for bringing guns and bombs to school, the US Department of Education said on May 8. The department gave a report to the expulsions as saying handguns accounted for 58 percent of the 6,093 expulsions in 1996--1997, against 7 percent for rifles or shotguns and 35 percent for other types of firearms. ""The report is a clear sign that our nation's public schools are cracking down on students who bring guns to school,"" Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a statement. ""We need to be tough-minded about keeping guns out of our schools and do everything to keep our children safe."" In March 1997, an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy using handguns and rifles shot dead four children and a teacher at a school in Jonesboro, Arkansas. In October, two students were killed and seven wounded in a shooting at a Mississippi school. Two months later, a 14-year-old boy killed three high school students and wounded five in Dasucah, Kentucky. Most of the expulsions, 56 percent, were from high schools, which have students from about age 13. 34 percent were from junior high schools and 9 percent were from elementary schools, the report said."

"The sentence "" Trying to take care of everything at once can be too much for you and as a result, you may not achieve anything"" is close to the meaning of _"	"Although there is no possibility of living completely free of stress , it is possible to prevent stress as well as reduce its effect when it can't be avoided. The US Department of Health and Human Services offers the following suggestions for the ways to deal with stress. Try physical activity When you are nervous, angry or upset, try reducing the pressure through exercise of physical activity. Running, walking, playing tennis or working in your garden are just some of the activities you might try. Physical exercise will relieve your anxiety and worry and help you to relax. Your body and your mind will work together to ease the stress in your life. Share your stress It helps to talk to someone about your anxiety and worries. Perhaps a friend, family member, teacher or even your leader can help you a better view of what is troubling you. If you feel your problem is serious, you might seek professional help from psychologist or a doctor. Knowing when to ask for help is an important step in avoiding serious problem later Take care of yourself You should make every effort to eat well and get enough rest. If you easily get angry and cannot sleep well enough, or if you are not eating properly, it will be more likely that you will fall into stressful situations. If stress repeatedly keeps you from sleeping, you should consult a doctor Make time for yourself Schedule time for both work and entertainment. Don't forget, play can be just as important to your over-all well-being as work. You need a break from your daily routine to just relax and have fun. Go window-shopping or work on a hobby. Allow yourself at least a half hour each day to do something you enjoy. Make a list of things you need to do Stress can result from disorganization and a feeling that ""there is so much to do, and not enough time."" Trying to take care of everything at once can be too much for you and as a result, you may not achieve anything. Instead, make a list of everything you have to do, then do one thing at a time, checking off each task as it is completed. Set out to do the more important tasks first. Go ahead and cry A good cry can a healthy way to bring relief to your anxiety. It might even help you avoid a headache or other physical effect of anxiety and stress"	['More hurry, less speed']
The study showed that _	"""Children need more geography field trips. Schools should organize geography field trips to stop pupils from sitting before computer screens for a long time. And children should be encouraged to see the natural world and study geography,"" says Michael Palin. The famous actor and writer, Michael Palin, made the comments days after a study showed that pupils in the UK were less likely to take part in science field trips than in most other developed countries. The study found that 13% of schools in the UK failed to take children out of the classroom regularly. Mr. Palin said that field trips were an important part of geography and that he was interested in geography because he had a good geography teacher and he had many opportunities to ""get out of the school building"". In an interview, Mr. Palin said, ""It was important for children to see things for themselves and learn about the rest of the world. You have to show them a mountain, show them a factory, show them a power station."" Mr. Palin had been to the North and South Poles, the Himalayas , the Sahara and Eastern Europe. ""Geography is about the study of the earth. It is a _ subject,"" he said. ""It's related to everything we do: what we eat, what transport we take to work, where we live, what houses are made of, and so on."" He said children needed to get basic geography knowledge first and that once they had the basic knowledge they could move on to deeper problems, such as population and pollution. ""Today's children will need to deal with a lot of problems when they grow up. They have to learn geography today,"" he said."

When crossing the Chilkoot Trail, the author _ .	"Standing in front of the ""Chilkoot Trailhead"" sign for 15 minutes, I didn't take one step. I was afraid of bears. That's what was keeping me from walking the trail alone. I had hiked through black-bear country back home in Colorado, but now I was in Alaska, home to the fierce brown grizzly bear. Fortunately, a friendly couple arrived and asked me to take their picture. We started talking and soon were walking the trail together. I was relieved. Ron and Carol were from Alaska and they taught me how to stay safe in bear country. I had finally started my hike along the famous Chilkoot Trail, where more than 115 years ago, thousands of gold miners had walked. I was writing a book about the Klondike Gold Rush, and I wanted to follow in the footsteps of the miners to know what it was really like. Ron, Carol, and I walked through the forest. As I was looking around at the beautiful scenery in the forest, I tripped over a big tree root and injured my ankle . Fortunately, my ankle felt better in the morning, and we followed the trail. We went to bed early that night because the following day would be the toughest hike of all. At dawn, we started hiking up the steep , green valley. Icy glaciers covered the mountains above. Soon we were as high as the clouds and could see only 20 feet in front of us. Finally, we reached the top of the Chilkoot pass and saw a Canadian flag moving in the heavy wind. Hours later, we arrived at our campground. The following morning, my ankle was feeling fine, and my fear of bears had mostly disappeared. I said good-bye to Ron and Carol and walked alone for the next two days. Without seeing any bears the entire trip, I finally arrived at Bennett Lake. I rode the old train down to the town of Skagway and checked into my hotel. While relaxing in my comfortable bed in the hotel, I thought of the miners from the Klondike Gold Rush. When the miners reached Bennett Lake, they had to cut down trees, build boats, and travel 500 miles down dangerous rivers and lakes. Then, when they finally reached the goldfields, they had to start digging."	['hurt himself by accident']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"Chengdu No.7 High School has formed a bright character and good tradition in school operation in the long period education and teaching practices. It mainly focuses on compulsory subjects, with a combination of selected subjects.

Which is true according to the passage?	"When a handheld video game runs out of power, all you have to do is plug it in and charge it up. Within a few years, some of you might do the same thing with mom's car. Automobile companies are developing vehiclesthat will plug into electricsockets , just like many laptops, digitalcameras, cell phones and small video game players do. Called ""plug-inhybrids ,"" these cars will get most of their power from electricity. Their drivers will rarely haveto stop at gas stations. The technology is more than just cool. In our automobile-filled world, plug-in vehicles could reduce the amount of gasoline we use. That gas is made from crude oil, which has been kept rising in cost. Plus, driving around in these hybrids may even help the environment. Gas-burning cars produce a lot of carbon dioxide, a type of greenhouse gas. These gases stay in the atmosphere, where theytrapheat and cause global warming. The first company-produced plug-in hybrids could hitthe roads by 20l0. But engineers still have a lot of work to do to make the technology practical and inexpensive. Batteries are the biggest challenge. In the plug-in-hybrid world, Li-ion batteries are getting the most attention. These batteries can store a large amount of energy in a small package, and they last a ly long time between charges. Li-ion batteries are standard in laptops, cell phones, heart devicesand similarportabledevices. But because cars are so big and heavy, it would still require a suitcase-sized Li-ion battery to power about l2km of driving. What's more, the batteries are extremely expensive. ""A car filled with batteries could go a long distance,"" says Ted Bohn, an electrical engineer in prefix = st1 /Chicago. ""But it couldn'thaul any people, and it would cost $l00,000."" So researchers need to figure out how to make batteries smaller and cheaper, among other questions. ""The answers don't exist yet,"" Bohn says. ""As a kid I thought someone someplace knows the answer to everything. All of these questions haven't been decided. That's what engineering is about -- making a guess, running tests and fine-tuningresults."""	['Drivers of plug-in hybrids will spend less money on gasoline.']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"If parents bring up a child with the aim of turning the child into a genius , they will cause great damage to him. According to several leading educational experts, this is one of the biggest mistakes that some parents make. Generally, the child will understand very well what the parents expect, and will fall. Unrealistic expectations of the parents can cause great damage to children. However, if parents are realistic about what they expect their children to do, and are hopeful in a sensible way, the child may succeed -especially if the parents are very supportive to their children. Michael Li is very lucky. He is very fond of music and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts and let him attend piano and violin lessons. Although his father is a good musician, he never makes Michael enter music competitions if he is unwilling to. Michael's friend, Winston Chen, however, is not so lucky. Both his parents are successful musicians, and they set too high a goal for Winston. They want their son to be as successful as they are and so they enter him for every piano competition held. They are very unhappy when he does not win. ""When I was your age, I used to win every competition I entered."" Winston's father tells him. Winston is always afraid that he will disappoint his parents and now he is always quiet and unhappy."	['how parents should bring up their children']

What lesson can we learn from the story?	"I woke up this morning. There is an empty feeling that I have had so many times before and it seems to be coming back into my mind. What is it? I can't figure it out. I got ready for work. On the way I decide to stop and get a cheese from the little shop just down the road. I have never been there before but I was hungry and it would be 5 hours before I got off work. The owner of the store took my order. He asked me what I wanted and I told him I heard he made a great cheese. He seemed pleased to hear that. As I was sitting in the small space,there was an elderly gentleman finishing his breakfast. He paid the waitress, received this change and made a small joke. As he turned to get up, which was quite a difficult feat for this gentleman, he looked over at me. I gave a small smile. He looked again in my direction for a moment and said to me, ""Has anyone ever told you, you have the most beautiful brown eyes?"" Seeing as I have blue eyes, I can't say I have ever heard that before. I humored him and said, ""No, I can't say anyone has ever told me that before."" He smiled, and said,""Well since they are blue you wouldn't have heard that, but you have beautiful blue eyes."" I laughed and said thank you very much. He began to tell me a few one liner jokes so I smiled and laughed at his jokes. He tried to get up to leave again and looked at me and said""Your smile really brightens a room, do you know that?""I said,""Thank you very much."" He proceeded to get up, which took him quite some time. As he got up he said,""Take care of that smile."" I felt a sense of comfort wash over me and I reflected on my morning and that empty feeling I had. For a moment in time it seemed to be filled."	['We should laugh off our worries in life']

What is the passage mainly about?	"People in the UK spend their free time in different ways. They usually use it to relax. They spend a lot of their free time at home. The most popular activity is watching TV. People in the UK watch TV for about 25 hours a week. They often record programs so they can watch them later. Reading is also a popular way of spending free time. People in the UK spend a lot of time reading newspapers and magazines. Many people in the UK have pets. They like playing with their pets in their free time. In summer, gardening is popular. And families often have a ""day out"" on the weekend. They often go to a festival or see a show. Young people like to go to clubs, and people of all ages like to go to the cinema. In winter, ""do-it-yourself"" is popular. People often spend their free time repairing houses. Some free time activities are with friends. Asking friends for a drink or a meal at home is the most usual one. Sometimes people and their friends have dinner in a restaurant. On the weekend, people in the UK like to spend their free time doing sports. The popular kinds of sports are soccer, horse racing, swimming, tennis, skating, climbing and hill walking. ."

While watching TV with others, women usually talk a lot because they _ .	When women sit together to watch a movie on TV, they usually talk simultaneously about a variety of subjects, including children, men, careers and what's happening in their lives. When groups of men and women watch a movie together, the men usually end up telling the women to shut up. Men can either talk or watch the screen--they can't do both--and they don't understand that women can. Besides, women consider that the point of all getting together is to have a good time and develop relationships--not just to sit there like couch potatoes staring at the screen. During the ad breaks, a man often asks a woman to explain the plot and tell him where the relationship between the characters is going. He is unable, unlike women, to read the subtle body language signals that reveal how the characters are feeling emotionally. Since women originally spent their days with the other women and children in the group, they developed the ability to communicate successfully in order to maintain relationships. For a woman, speech continues to have such a clear purpose: to build relationships and make friends. For men, to talk is to relate the facts. Men see the telephone as a communication tool for sending facts and information to other people, but a woman sees it as a means of bonding . A woman can spend two weeks on vacation with her girlfriend and, when she returns home, telephone the same girlfriend and talk for another two hours. There is no convincing evidence that social conditioning, the fact that girls' mothers talked to them more, is the reason why girls talk more than boys. Psychiatrist Dr Michael Lewis, author of Social Behaviour and Language Acquisition, conducted experiments that found mothers talked to, and looked at, baby girls more often than baby boys. Scientific evidence shows parents respond to the brains of their children. Since a girl's brain is better organized to send and receive speech, we therefore talk to them more. Consequently, mothers who try to talk to their sons are usually disappointed to receive only short grunts in reply.	['think they can have a good time and develop relationships']
What's the main idea of the passage?	"The election is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for prefix = st1 /USpresident-elect Barack Obama has begun. The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest place because he was against the war inIraqand he planned to fix the difficult economy. But what will the first African-American president do for race relations? Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes, musicians and pop stars for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, ""Kobe (the basketball player) doesn't have to be everyone's role model anymore."" A USA Today survey found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites ""will eventually be worked out"". This is the most hopeful answer since the question was first asked in 1963. However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will solve many of the social problems facing low-income black families. It's unlikely that Obama will be able to _ such trends overnight. However, Bil Banks, an expert of African-American Studies, says that young blacks need to find role models to follow. ""That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,"" he told the Los Angeles Times. ""It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence."" In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US."	"[""Obama's victory has inspired young black people.""]"
Why does the writer NOT make sure whether there is love between her parents?	"Sometimes I really doubt whether there is love between my parents. Every day they don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV. In their opinion, ""I love you"" is too luxurious for them to say. Sending flowers on Valentine's Day is even more out of the question. One day, my mother was sewing a quilt . ""Mom, I have a question to ask you."" ""What?"" she replied, still doing her work. ""Is there love between you and Dad?"" My mother stopped her work and raised her head with surprise in her eyes. Then she said, ""Susan, look at this thread. Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt. The _ really makes the quilt strong and durable. If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread. Love is inside."" I listened carefully but I couldn't understand until the next spring. At that time, my father suddenly got sick seriously. After they were back from the hospital, my mother helped him walk slowly on the beautiful country road every morning. My father had never been so gentle. But after two months he still couldn't walk by himself. All of us were worried about him. ""Dad, how are you feeling now?"" I asked him one day. ""Susan, don't worry about me, ""he said gently. ""To tell you the truth, I just like walking with your mom. ""Reading his eyes, I know he loves my mother deeply. Once I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses. But from this experience, I understand that love is just a thread in the quilt of our life. Love is inside, making life strong and warm. ,."	['All of the above.']
What might be the most suitable title for the passage?	"The European Union announced plans on Tuesday to temporar-ily ban the use of animal cloning for food production, while allowing imports of food derived from the offspring of clones from the United States and elsewhere. The report from the European Commission followed a call by EU lawmakers in July for a total ban on food derived from cloned animals and their traditionally bred offspring, citing ethical concerns over the industrial production of cloned meat. The Commission said a temporary five-year EU ban on cloning for food production was justified on animal welfare grounds, but said banning imports of food from the offspring of clones was unnecessary and would disrupt global trade. ""Food from cloned animals is safe. In fact, the scientific opinion is that it cannot be differentiated in any way from food normally bred animals. The issue is animal welfare,"" EU Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli told reporters. Food derived from the offspring of clones presents no such animal welfare issues, and banning its sale and import would be impossible because the origin is untraceable, Dalli said. ""Such a prohibition would lead to a ban of imports of any food of animal origin (meat, milk and processed products)from third countries allowing the cloning technique,"" the report said. ""We're not going to regulate for the world,"" Dalli added. But animal welfare groups criticized the Commission's decision, saying it had bowed to pressure from third countries. ""We do not accept the Commission's position that it would be impossible to enforce a ban that includes the offspring of cloned animals, as (other) meat traceability systems are already in place,"" said Sonja Van Tichelen, director of the Eurogroup for Animals."

From the text, we can see that _ .	"We have dreams almost every night. Do you ever notice the colors of your dreams? Do you dream in black and white or do you dream in yellow, red and green? New research suggests that the type of television you watched as a child has a great effect on the color of your dreams. While almost all people under 25 dream in color, thousands of people over 55, all of whom were brought up with black and white TV sets, often dream in monochrome . ""It suggests there could be a critical period in our childhood when watching films has a big impact on the way dreams are formed"", said Eva Murzyn, a psychology student at Dundee University in Britain who carried out the study. Research from 1915 through the 1950s suggested that the vast majority of dreams are in black and white. But the tide turned in the sixties, and later results suggested that up to 83 percent of dreams contain some color. Since this period also marked the transition between black-and-white film and TV and Technicolor ,an obvious explanation was that the media had been painting people's dreams. However, there weren't any firm conclusions. But now Miss Murzyn believes she has proven the link. She made a survey of more than 60 people, half of whom were over 55 and half of whom were under 25. She asked the volunteers to answer a questionnaire on the color of their dreams and their childhood exposure to film and TV. She then analyzed her own data. Only 4.4 percent of the under-25s' dreams were black and white. The over-55s who had had access to color TV and film during their childhood also reported a very low proportion of just 7.3 percent. But the over-55s who only had access to black-and -white media reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time. Even though they would have spent only a few hours a day watching TV or films, their attention and emotion would have been heightened during this time, leaving a deeper imprint on their mind, Miss Murzyn told the New Scientist. ""The crucial time is between three and ten when we all begin to have the ability to dream"", she said."	['watching TV or films probably affects dream color']
What is the best title for the passage?	"A 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile late on Tuesday, cutting power and leading to small landslides and a tsunami . Four men and one woman died --two who suffered heart attacks and three who were crushed . About 300 prisoners escaped from the northern port city of Iquique in the immediate aftershock . The quake struck at about 8:46 p.m. local time, some 60 miles northwest of Iquique. It had a depth of 12.5 miles. Chile's National Emergency Office asked coastal residents to leave for safe places. ""The fact is, we will know the extent of the damage as time goes by and when we inspect the areas in the light of day,"" Chile's President Michelle Bachelet said early on Wednesday. ""The country has faced these first emergency hours very well."" Residents in the port city of Antofagasta walked calmly through the streets to higher ground as traffic became heavy in some places. ""Many people are fearful after experiencing the powerful earthquake in 2010, so they immediately rushed to higher ground when they heard the tsunami warning,"" said a government official.""There have been lots of aftershocks and communications have been cut off in many of the affected areas. So people are waiting in the dark hills, not knowing what is to come, and hoping they will be able to return to their homes safely."" The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center sent our several tsunami warnings, but called off all of them by early Wednesday. Tsunami waves of more than six feet caused by the earthquake washed ashore on the coast of Pisagua. Iquique, with a population of more than 200,000, saw seven-foot waves."

Do you point to words with your finger as you read? 3. Do you move your head from side to side as you read? 4. Do you read one word at a time? If you answer ""yes"" to any of these questions, start at once to break the habit. If you move your lips, hold your fingers over them, or hold a piece of paper between your lips while you are reading. Then if your lips move, you will know it and can stop them. If you point to words, hold the two sides of your book, one side with your left hand, the other side with your right hand. Then you will not have a free finger to use in pointing while reading.

What was the matter with Ms. Thatcher after she resigned?	"On April 8th, 2013, the world felt sorry because of the death of former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who died at the age of 87. Besides being the country's longest leader (1979-1990) in the 20th century, she was the first woman to lead Britain. She worked hard and did well in her work, so she was called ""Iron Lady"". Whatever you think of Margaret Thatcher, the thing everyone does agree on is that she was a woman with great decisions. When she took over Britain in 1979, she led a country that was in economic trouble. She faced a lot of problems because of the poor economic position. In order to make the country become strong again, Ms. Thatcher had to make some hard and special decisions like raising interest rates and even taxes at a time when most British people were living a hard life. In this way she led Britain to run out of economic troubles. Early in her second term, just as things were looking a little better, she faced another problem -- a strike by the British Miners Union. Once again, the Iron Lady stood her ground to stop the longest strike in the country's history. In 1982, Argentina said that they had owned the Falkland Islands since the 19th century. Britain, however, considered the islands to be one of their overseas dependent territories . Margaret Thatcher tried to talk about the problem with Argentines. But Argentines didn't agree with her ideas, so Ms. Thatcher did what any strong leader would do -- send in the British Army. It took 74 days, and on 14th June 1982, the Argentine army finally failed and Britain controlled the Falkland Islands again. When Ms. Thatcher resigned in 1990, she left behind a country that was very strong. Unluckily, during the last few years of her life, something was wrong with her mind. She hardly remembered anything that was happening around her and even what she had done during her wonderful lifetime."	"[""She almost couldn't remember anything.""]"
How did the men working on the road treat Bobby?	"On a cold winter morning in the late 1930s, Bobby awoke early. It was a day that Bobby would never forget. Bobby, his brother and his mother were once again abandoned by his father. When times got hard, the man left home. Bobby wasn't surprised. He must take the responsibility for caring for his family. He put on the warmest clothes he had and pulled on his old socks and torn shoes. After thinking of a way to keep his feet dry, he went outside looking for work. Coming across some men working on the road, he joined in and worked hard for hours. Suddenly, rain poured down. ""Go home and get out of this weather,"" the men shouted, giving him a few coins. Bobby used the money to buy as much food as he could afford in the nearest store. While holding a small bag of food ,Bobby stopped to adjust the thick paper in his shoes. A man, who was a member of the Salvation Army, saw Bobby's problem. He bought Bobby a new pair of shoes. I wasn't there on that cold day. But I've heard the story many times and can always imagine my father, as a child, dancing and wearing a pair of new shoes home. Several years later, Bobby joined the navy. He continued to support his family and meanwhile worked for the Salvation Army so that another little boy somewhere might receive a new pair of shoes for Christmas. The tradition lasted until my father became too ill. Daddy died six years ago. While the new shoes kept his feet warm in the 1930s, Daddy's act of giving back for tens of years warmed his heart in a greater way."	['They gave him some money']
What will certainly happen when visitors come to Key West?	Key West, Florida is a wonderful place to spend a vacation. It is a truly charming and fun city for the whole family. And of course you will get the good weather of Florida, with which you have plenty of time to enjoy the outdoor activities. Key West is the most southern city in the continental USA. That is why their sunsets are so amazing. The sun is brighter there at sunset than anywhere else. It's so beautiful that everyone gathers every evening at Mallory Dock to watch it. And there you will see jugglers and musicians entertaining in the streets. The houses surrounded by trees and flowers are lovely in Key West, and many are restored and absolutely charming. There are too many hotels, inns, guest houses and restaurants to talk about. They all look great and their prices change according to seasons, and you can find something to suit every pocketbook and every taste. At the seaport you will see various boats. It's very interesting. The city is rich in history and was home to Ernest Hemingway. Harry Truman chose it for his winter White House. There are so many public transportation--taxis, tour trains, trolleys, bikes--and you can even walk if you choose. There are beautiful coral reefs. The deep reefs are farther off shore and are best visited with an experienced guide. However, there are shallow reefs close in where snorkelers can explore to their heart's content. At Key West Marine Park you can do some good snorkeling. In Key West you can go diving, fishing and do all sorts of water sports. The problem with Key West is that no one ever wants to leave. Be sure to take your camera with you because you will want to snap everything you see. And whatever you do, be sure to take in the sunset because it is nothing like anything you have ever seen.

What did the little girl in Vietnam say to Butler?	"Bob Butler lost his legs in 1965 in Vietnam. Later he returned to the USA and began his life in wheelchair . One day he was working in his yard when he heard a woman calling for help. He began moving towards the woman's house, but something on the ground stopped his wheelchair going through the back door. So he got out of his wheelchair and started to crawl . When Butler got through the back door of the house, he found there was a little girl in the pool. She had no arms and couldn't swim. Her mother was calling for help crazily. Butler got into the pool and pulled the little girl out of the water. Her face was blue, and she was not breathing. Butler did CPR on her right away. As Butler continued doing CPR, he talked to the mother. ""Don't worry,"" he said. ""It'll be OK. I was her arms to get out of the pool. I am now her lungs. Together we can make it."" Soon the little girl coughed and began to cry. The mother asked Butler how he knew it would be OK. ""I didn't know,"" he told her. ""But when my legs were blown off in the war, a little girl in Vietnam said to me in broken English, 'It'll be OK. You will live. I'll be your legs. Together we make it.'

Why was the smile an important gift?	Sixteen years ago a boy gave me an important gift. It was a smile. It was the early autumn of my first year at a middle school, and my old school was far away. As a result, no one knew who I was. I was very lonely, and afraid to speak to anyone. Every time I heard the other students talking and laughing, I felt my heart break. I couldn't talk with anyone about my problems. Then one day, when my classmates were talking happily with their friends, I was sitting at my desk unhappily as usual. At that moment, a boy entered the classroom. I didn't know who he was. He passed by me and then turned back. He looked at me, with a smile. Suddenly, I felt the touch of something bright and friendly. It made me feel happy and warm. That smile changed my life. I started to talk with other students and made friends. Day by day, I became closer to everyone in my class. The boy with the lucky smile has become my best friend now. One day I asked him why he had smiled, but he couldn't remember doing so! It doesn't matter because all the dark days have gone. I believe that the world is what you think it is. If you think it is lonely, you might always be alone. So smile at the world and it will smile back.	['Because the writer felt lonely and had no friends and it made her feel happy and warm.']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"To get an extra 14 years of life, don't smoke, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly and drink alcohol in a proper amount.That is according to a study published this Monday in the Public Library of Science Medicine Journal. After tracking more than 20,000 people aged 45 to 79 years in the United Kingdom from about 1993 to 2007, Kay-Tee Khaw of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues found that people who adopted these four healthy habits lived all average of 14 years longer than those who didn't. ""We've known for a long time that these behaviors are good things to do, but we've not seen this benefit before, ""said Susan Jebb, head of Nutrition and Health at Britain's Medical Research Council.""The benefit was also seen regardless of whether or not people were fat and what social class they came from."" Study participants scored a point each for not smoking, regular physical activity, eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day and moderate alcohol intake. Public health experts said they hoped the study would inspire governments to introduce policies helping people to adopt these changes.But because the study only observed people rather than testing specific changes, it would be impossible to conclude that people who suddenly adopted these healthy behaviors would surely gain 14 years. ""We can't say that any person could gain 14 years by doing these things, ""said Dr.Tim Armstrong, a physical activity expert at the World Health Organization.""The 14 years is an average across the population of what's theoretically possible."" ""Most people know that things like a good diet matter and that smoking isn't good for them, ""Susan Jebb said.""We need to work on providing people with much more practical support to help them change."""

Which of the following might be the best title for the passage?	"United States President George W. Bush is expected to issue a directive in the next few weeks. It will give the US Air Force a green light for the development of space weapons, US media reported last week. This would potentially start a new global arms race, some experts have warned. To keep that from happening, last Wednesday the White House explained that it was not considering putting weapons in space. It said it was making a shift inprefix = st1 /USspace policy to allow for protection of satellites. But some defense analysts and arms control advocates argue that the policy will pave the way for the US to put both defensive and offensive ( ) weapons in space. ""No one should be fooled,"" said Theresa Hitchens, an American weapons expert. The USis now restricted by a 1996 directive signed by President Bill Clinton. Plans for space weapons were vetoed by the Clinton cabinet. The directive emphasized the peaceful use of space , in agreement with almost unanimous ( ) global opinion. The USmilitary has placed importance on space and has sent up numberous satellites for troop communications and to provide intelligence and data to guide bombs to their targets. The US Air Force wants to develop space- based weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world within 90 minutes of receiving the order to open fire. These new weapons under development cover a wide range. They include hunter- killer satellites and orbiting weapons. And they use lasers, radio waves, or even dense metal tubes, known as "" Rods from God"", dropped from space to do the damage. There are many barriers to the setting up of this kind of program, experts say. First is the coast. It is estimated that the budget may be US $220 billion to US $ 1 trillion . The technical difficulties of developing reliable space weapons are also a problem. And, the program will draw strong criticism from around the world. Experts worry about starting a space arms race."

Why does the writer write this passage?	Where has the Time gone? is the hottest song that has moved thousands of Chinese. Chinese parents give their children endless love and want nothing from them. However, sometimes, daughters and sons are too busy growing up and forget that their parents are getting older and older. What should we do? Let's have a look at a letter of a father's. Dear son, One day if you see me old and I am not myself, have patience and try to understand me. If I get dirty when eating.. ., if I cannot dress.. ., have patience. Remember the hours I spent teaching it to you. If, when I speak to you, I say the same things one thousand and one times, do not stop me and listen to me. When you were small, I had to read to you one thousand and one times the same story until you get to sleep. When I do not want to have a shower, neither shame me nor scold me. Remember when I had to chase you with a thousand excuses I made, in order that you wanted to bath. When you see me meet something new, give me the necessary time and don't laugh at me. I taught you how to do so many things _ to eat well, to dress well... to face life. If I do not want to eat, do not force me. I know well when I need to and when not. When my legs do not allow me to walk, give me your hand the same way I did when you gave your first steps. When sometimes I lose the memory during our conversation, let me have the necessary time to remember. And if I cannot do it, do not become nervous because the most important thing is not my conversation but to be with you and to have you listen to me.

According to the text,Rocky and Kelly _ .	"Rocky Lyons was five years old when his mother,Kelly,was driving along the country road with him.He was asleep on the front seat of their truck,with his feet resting on her lap.As his mom drove carefully down the winding country road,she turned onto a narrow bridge.The truck hit a rock and slid off the road.She attempted to bring it back up onto the road by pressing hard on the gas pedal and turning the steering wheel to the left.But Rocky's foot got caught between her leg and the steering wheel and she lost control of the truck. The truck fell into a 20foot ravine .When it hit bottom,Rocky woke up.""What happened,Mama?"" he asked.""Our wheels are pointing toward the sky."" Kelly was seriously wounded and blinded by blood.""I'll get you out,Mama,""announced Rocky,who had surprisingly escaped injury.He climbed out from under Kelly,slid through the open window and tried to _ his mother out.But she didn't move. ""Just let me sleep,"" begged Kelly,who was out of consciousness.Rocky insisted,""Mom,you can't go to sleep."" Rocky managed to push Kelly out of the truck and told her he'd climb up to the road and stop a car to get help.Fearing that no one would be able to see her little boy in the dark,Kelly refused to let him go alone.Instead they slowly moved up to the road.The pain was so great that Kelly wanted to give up,but Rocky wouldn't let her. Rocky kept repeating the inspirational phrase,""I know you can,I know you can.""When they finally reached the road,Rocky broke into tears seeing his mother's torn face clearly for the first time.Waving his arms and shouting, ""Please stop!"" the boy stopped a truck.His mother was sent to hospital.

What is one of the most attractions for the visitors?	China Science and Technology Museum was opened to the public in September 1988. But the second project was completed in May 2000. Its main task is to spread knowledge of science and technology among the public. The activities of China Science and Technology Museum include popular science exhibitions, Astro-vision film shows, training education programs and experiment exhibition programs. The museum has an area of 40,000 square metres, of which 16,000 square metres is for exhibition halls. The Astro-vision Theatre is one of the museum's major attractions and also one of the largest Astro-vision theatres in the world. It makes visitors feel they are in actual events rather than see a film. Many great science activities are often held at the museum, and the museum wants to be an important window to the world.

The grandfather gave his grandson a lesson by _ .	"An old farmer lived on a farm with his young grandson. Each morning Grandpa was up early to read his Bhagavat Geeta. His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to imitate him in every way he could. One day the grandson asked, ""Grandpa! I try to read the Bhagavat Geeta just like you but I don't understand it, What good does reading the Bhagavat Geeta do?"" The Grandfather quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied, ""Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water."" The boy did as he was told, but all the water leaked out before he got back to the house. The grandfather laughed and said, ""You'll have to move a little faster next time,"" and sent him back to the river with the basket to try again. This time the boy ran faster, but again the same took place. He told his grandfather that it was impossible to carry water with a basket. The old man said, "" You're just not trying hard enough,"" So the boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran hard, but when he reached his grandfather the basket was again empty. he said, ""See Grandpa, it's useless!"" ""So you think it is useless?"" The old man said, ""Look at the basket."" The boy looked at the basket and for the first time realized that the basket was different. It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket into a clean one inside and outside. ""You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read it, you will be changed, inside and out. That is the work of Krishna in our lives."""	['asking him to carry water with a basket']
What makes Cyprus different from the other two places?	"Prague is an ancient European city, featuring one of the most magnificent Old Towns in Europe, along with delicious food, inexpensive shopping and friendly people. Prague is also famous as being home to one of the most famous 20th century writers, Franz Kafka. The famous Czech beer is also one of the reasons to visit Prague. The narrow streets of the older parts of the town are appealing the visitors to take nice long walk and settle in some of the many restaurants, which offer top-quality foods at a low price. The buildings there are mostly tower-shaped,and so Prague is called ""city of a hundred ."" Mauritius Also known as the Paradise on Earth, Mauritius lies about 560 miles (900 km) east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. It is a place of magnificent natural beauty coupled with excellent customer service, which makes for an unforgettable romantic experience at the edge of the world's warmest ocean. There are lots to see and do in Mauritius: the coral reefs surrounding the island offer stunning beauty and great underwater adventures to those who want to dive into the precious waters. The nature of Mauritius mostly resembles that of Paradise, allowing every couple visiting this island to feel like Adam and Eve. That is an experience nobody would want to miss! Cyprus The very name Cyprus, it has been said, glitters with an age-old myth. Today, history and hedonism are comfortably mixed on the island. Some five-star resorts within walking distance of well-preserved Greek and Roman ruins offer the convenience the modern traveler has come to expect. Cyprus features a romantic history, as it was Anthony's gift to his beloved Cleopatra during the glorious days of the Roman Empire. Maybe that is why you feel always a little special once you set foot on Cyprus. For more information about many other most romantic places in the world, just log on at http://www.jurgita.com."

Why did the man have salty coffee all his life?	"He met her at the party. She was so outstanding, with many boys around her, while he was so normal, with nobody paying attention to him. At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him. She was surprised, but due to being polite, she agreed. They sat in a nice coffee shop. He was too nervous to say anything, and she felt uncomfortable, thinking, ""Please let me go home."" Suddenly he asked the waiter, ""Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee."" Everybody stared at him---so strange! His face turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously, ""Why do you have this hobby?"" He replied, ""When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing in the sea, and I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood. I miss my hometown so much. I miss my parents who are still living there."" While saying that, tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell about his homesickness must be a man who loves home, cares about home, and has a good sense of responsibility. Then she also started to speak, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands: he was kind-hearted, warm and careful. He was such a good person but ! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married the prince, then they were living a happy life...And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee. After 40 years, he passed away, leaving her a letter which said, ""My dearest, please forgive my whole-life lie. This was the only lie I said to you ---the salty coffee."" ""Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time. Actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead."" ""I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything."" ""Now I'm dying, I'm afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee. What a strange and bad taste! But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life!"" ""Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for a second time, I still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again."" Her tears made the letter totally wet. Someday, someone asked her, ""What's the taste of salty coffee?"" ""It's sweet,"" she replied."	['To keep his word.']
"According to the text, what might be the percentage of no ""El Nino"" this year?"	"The UN weather agency warned on Tuesday there was a good chance of an ""El Nino"" climate phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean this year, bringing droughts and heavy rainfall to the rest of the world. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said its modeling suggested a ""fairly large potential for an El Nino, most likely by the end of the second quarter of 2016"". The El Nino phenomenon occurs every two to seven years, when the trade winds that circulate surface water in the tropical Pacific start to weaken. WMO pointed out Tuesday that since last December, trade winds had weakened and there had been a significant warming of the waters below the surface in the central Pacific. ""While there is no guarantee this situation will lead to an El Nino event, the longer the trade winds remain weakened, and subsurface temperatures stay significantly warmer than average, the higher chances are,"" it said. Two thirds of climate models predicted that the phenomenon would begin sometime between June and August, with one-fifth suggesting it could start as early as May, and the remaining predicting no El Nino this year, it said. It is often followed by a return swing of La Nina, which is characterized by unusually cool ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. ""El Nino has an important warming effect on global average temperatures,"" Jarraud cautioned, stressing that combined with warming from greenhouse gases such events had ""the potential to cause a sharp rise in global average temperature""."

Why did Albert Einstein hate school?	"When Albert Einstein was young, he was a quiet child who spent much of his time alone. He was slow to talk and had difficulty in learning to read. When Albert was five years old, his father gave him a compass. Albert was filled with wonder when he discovered that the compass needle always pointed in the same direction ---- the north. He asked his father and his uncle what caused the needle to move. Their answers were difficult for Albert to understand. Yet he spent a lot of time thinking about them. He said later that he felt something must be hidden behind things. Albert didn't like school. The German schools of that time were not pleasant. Students couldn't ask questions. Albert said he felt as if he were in prison.. One day Albert told his uncle Jacob how much he hated school, especially mathematics. His uncle told him to solve mathematical problems by pretending to be a policeman. ""You are looking for someone,"" he said, ""but you don't know who he is. Call him X. Find him by using your mathematical tools."" Albert learned to love mathematics. He was studying the _ mathematics of calculus while all his friends were still studying simple mathematics. Instead of playing with his friends he thought about things such as ""What would happen if people could travel at the speed of his light?"" Albert wanted to teach mathematics and physics. He graduated with honors, but it was a pity that he could not get a teaching job."	['Students were not allowed to ask questions.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"""USA? Britain? Which country is better to study in?"" We often hear such discussions. As China opens its doors, studying abroad has become a dream for many Chinese students. They want to learn about the world. It's true that studying abroad can help students develop themselves. Language skills will improve and it may be easier to find jobs. But there are problems that should be considered. Language is the first. Students must spend a lot of time learning another language and getting used to a different culture. Students must also learn to live without parents' care and deal with all kinds of things they haven't had to do before, like looking after themselves. There are reports about Chinese students abroad sinking into an ocean of difficulties and giving up easily. When they have to take care of themselves, it is hard for students to study well. Finally, studying abroad brings a heavy burden to the family. For most Chinese parents, the cost of studying abroad is very high. But is it worth it? We know that there are many famous people who succeed in great things through their hard work in China. Liu Xiang is a good example. Once an American teacher invited him there but he refused. He kept training hard with his Chinese teacher. He surprised the world when he won a gold medal at the Athens Olympics. So when you wonder which country is better to study in, consider whether studying abroad is the right choice."	['Studying abroad will make it easy for students to learn well.']
What is TRUE about Deborah Duffey?	It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind. The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over. After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much. Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession. And Deborah began to see a new light in her life. Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

To follow this passage,the writer is likelhy to continue telling about _	"Staying silent can be just as powerful as the words you mean to say, like when the act of hugging will be more comforting than saying, ""Sorry for your loss."" Another time when silence is golden is when you are unsure of what to say. If you are confused about your own feelings concerning a matter, it's best to stay quiet until you are more certain because more harm can be done by revealing false or exaggerated feelings Choose silence instead of blurting out 'in-the-moment' feelings that are hurtful and not really how you feel in the grand scheme of things. When you feel the urge to say an unkind thing, take a few breaths and think of the possible consequences of your words. Silence can be your best friend during negotiations. Say your piece, then close your mouth, and let the other person come to their own conclusions. Your silence shows that one, you are confident in what you just said, and two, you respect the other person enough to hear what they have to say. Sometimes silence is the best and most timely solution because the other person is not in a position to hear what you have to say. For example, when a friend needs for you to listen to her problems, but she is unable to accept your advice at that moment. Practice being silent at work when you don't have anything meaningful to contribute. Unless you can elevate the conversation by pointing out something interesting, missing, or beneficial, it's best to just observe and learn. Finally, silence is golden when you don't want to engage in a fool's argument. As some squabbles will never be resolved, one must agree to disagree. Hower,there will be times in your life where you will need the power of your voice,the voice within you that wants and needs to be respected and apprecitsed."

The best title of the text could be _ .	"I grew up in a neighborhood that many city kids can only dream of: a quiet street that was our adventure park: a street filled with kids whose parents had to drag us inside for dinner, most of the time long after the sun had retired for the night. Our street was also a zoo. There were cats, dogs, birds, fish, sheep, rabbits, horses, not to mention all the little things we caught and decided to keep as pets. But these farm animals weren't just farm animals. They were our friends. Everything was great. I loved my life and never wanted anything to change. Then a day arrived that would ruin everything. The day they said, ""We're moving."" Dad's job had been relocated, and I would soon be leaving everything I had ever known. I cried. ""We are going to live near the beach,"" I kept hearing, but it was no comfort. I hated my parents for doing this to me, for putting an end to the series of colorful adventures. I watched as removal trucks were filled with boxes my life had been shoved into, but I knew that there was one thing that wouldn't fit into a box. My neighborhood and all the fun and adventure it contained. I forced myself to dislike our new life and insistently referred to our old house as ""home"". I would give no one the satisfaction of enjoying our new beachfront lifestyle, not my family, my friends or myself. To admit taking pleasure in the new meant to let go off the old. But once I allowed myself to like the town, I grew to love it and I don't want anything to change. But this time, I know it will. And as scary as that may be, it's okay because exciting adventures can happen anywhere. All I have to do is to let them happen."	['Adventures could be everywhere']

How do people usually spend a quiet holiday by the sea or in the mountains?	Millions of people all over the world spend their holidays travelling. They travel to visit other countries, modern cities and ancient towns. They travel to enjoy these special places, or just to relax. It is always interesting to discover new things and different ways of life, such as by meeting different people, trying different food, and listening to different music. People who live in the country like to go to big cities. They like to spend their time visiting museums and art galleries, looking at shop windows and dining at restaurants. People who live in the city usually like a quiet holiday by the sea or in the mountains, with nothing to do but walk and bathe in the sun. Most travellers take a camera with them and take pictures of everything that interests them. Then, perhaps years later, they can look at the photos and be reminded of the happy time they once had. People often travel by train, by boat or by car. All means of travelling have their advantages and disadvantages and people choose one according to their plans and the places they are going. If we travel a lot, we will see and discover a lot of things that we could never see or experience at home, though we may read about them in books and newspapers. The best way to study geography is to travel, and the best way to get to know and understand people is to meet them in their own homes.	['They do nothing but walk and bathe in the sun.']
Which of the following ideas can be financially wise?	"You put a great deal of effort into reaching the college of your choice. It's time to get started. But what's next? Beginning college can be an exciting but awkward time. Follow these tips to adjust to your new life rapidly and make the most of your college experience. * To save time and money, use the college's bus system. Taking the bus to school is quick, easy and free in most college towns. You won't have to locate or afford a place to park either. It's also a good way to be environmentally aware. * Save pennies on books by waiting until class starts. You might not even need all of the recommended books. New textbooks cost an arm and a leg. Try buying used textbooks -- it's a surefire way to save money and serves the purpose as well. * Do never look at college life as an endless series of parties and social activities. But there is a whole lot more to college if you're serious about graduating. Having a good college experience is all about balancing work and fun. * Be aware that your living environment can largely affect your academic success. If the dorm doesn't suit you, consider living at home with your family or renting your own apartment. The best location for your studies isn't always your dorm. Find a quiet area, like the library, to do your work. Alternatively, buy some headphones that block out noise. * Be mindful of your diet. Make healthy food choices and watch what you eat. Avoid foods that are processed or high in sugar. The ""freshman 15"" is real. Many college students gain at least 15 pounds during their freshmen year. * While electives can be helpful when figuring out your major, you shouldn't entirely rely on them. Clubs and other organizations exist around. Get involved. Make sure, though, that you still have time to study. _ can hurt your grades."	['Buying used books.']
What can be inferred from the passage?	"Finally, the long-awaited flying car is almost here. AeroMobil, a Slovakian company, plans to start selling its creation, the AeroMobil3. 0, in 2017. The company claims on its site that the vehicle ""transforms in seconds from an automobile to an airplane"" by using ""existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes.""The vehicle is petrol-powered and has wings that fold, which allows it to be parked like a car, though it is nearly 20 feet long. The company's website features a video where the AeroMobil 3. 0 drives out of a hangar ( )and goes down a highway, sharing the road with ordinary cars until it arrives at an airstrip. The car then unfolds its wings and takes off from a stretch of grass, rather than a paved tarmac , and flies through the air like any other small airplane. AeroMobil spokesman Stefan Vadocz said his company hasn't decided on an exact price because it's not ready yet.""The prototype is a work in progress,"" he said in an email. But he said the price would be several hundreds of thousands of euros---somewhere in between a sports car and a light sports aircraft. The vehicle seats two people---the pilot and a passenger---and its single propeller is located at the rear of the plane. The company said the car's top speed on the road is at least 99 mph and while flying it is at least 124 mph. It can fly for 435 miles before running out of fuel. It has a steel framework and carbon coating and is powered by a Rotax 912, a four-cylinder aircraft engine from BRP of Austria. Flying cars aren't exactly new. The concept has been around since long before The Jetsons popularized the idea in the 1960s. It has been a regular topic in Popular Science ever since World War I ace, Eddie Rickenbacker, wrote about it in 1924. But getting a practical, reliable flying car off the ground has been a serious challenge. Glenn Curtiss discovered this in 1918 when he developed the Curtiss Autoplane. It turned out to be more of a hopper than a flyer, so it failed to become popular with the public."	['The design work on the AeroMobil 3. 0 is still in progress.']
The author planned to _ in Budapest.	It all started when my sister was invited to speak at a threeday conference in Budapest. Mom and I thought we would join her because she was not able to take her husband or daughter. After all, how often does a trip to Budapest come along? We began planning a week long trip to Budapest. It was the first visit to Europe for all three of us, and there was so much we wanted to see that we couldn't narrow our base destinations down any further than Venice, Budapest, Rome, Sorrento and Florence. We immediately applied for passports. We looked over maps and through books trying to decide exactly where to stay. I spent hours and days researching hotels, transportation, museums. We waited and waited to book tickets so we had a starting point on our dates. Finally everything fell into place and we decided our plans. The excitement continued to build day by day. I researched packing tips online and my list of necessities grew. Mom and I compared notes for weeks trying to decide what to wear, what to bring, what to buy ... in the end, however, we just chose whatever was comfortable and to be honest, mainly wore the same couple of clothes day after day, washing them in the hotel as necessary. The only good clothes we took were for the ballet in Budapest. And thank goodness for that -- I can't imagine lugging a larger suitcase on and off during the journey to Florence, and some other places. The big day arrived and with bags packed and repacked, it was off to the airport for our first European adventure!	['watch a ballet']

What caused Greg Woodburn to donate old shoes for poor children?	"Greg Woodburn, a student at the University of Southern California, spends a lot of time cleaning sneakers he collected.But soon the shoes will be sent to poor children in the United States and 20 other countries, thanks to Woodburn's Share Our Soles (S.O.S.) charity. A high school track star in the town of Ventura, California, Woodburn was treated in hospital for months with knee and hip injuries. ""I started thinking about the health benefits, the friendship and the confidence I got from running,"" he says, ""And I realized there are children who don't even have shoes."" Woodburn gathered up his old sneakers, then asked his friends to donate.His goal was to have 100 pairs by Christmas this year.When he collected more than 500 pairs, he decided to turn the shoe drive into a year-round endeavor. Back then, the sneakers came from donation boxes at the YMCA and the local sporting goods store and from door-to-door pickups.Woodburn has now set up collection boxes at two high schools, city gym and recreation center.He has started accepting adult sizes and sandals.So far, S.O.S has collected and donated more than 3,000 pairs. Woodburn has cleaned all the shoes.After sorting the shoes by size, Woodburn selects the good shoes for the washing machine and the worn-out ones for recycling. To ship the footwear, Woodburn teamed with Sports Gift, a nonprofit organization that provides soccer and baseball equipment to children around the world.Keven Baxter, founder and president, says, ""We'd send kids balls and shoes.I've heard that for many of these kids, these old sneakers are the only shoes they had.They wear them to school and to do sports.So Greg's running shoes were a nice addition for us."" For many recipients, the shoes represent opportunity.Two young boys in Southern California attended school on alternate days because they shared a pair of shoes.They were too big for one boy and too small for the other.Thanks to S.O.S., each brother received his own pair of shoes.The boys now attend school daily and enjoy their learning.When they graduate, they say, they will help a stranger, just as Woodburn helped them."

In this book, a little girl tells about her life while her dad is working far away from her. ""I haven't seen my dad for one year, eight months and twenty-two days,"" the girl writes in her journal. She writes everything she has done so that her father will never miss a day. Sunday is the cheapest day for long-distance phone calls, so that day is special to the girl and her mother. One Sunday phone call brings surprising news. Dad tells his daughter that she and Mom will finally be able to come and live with him in the United States.

Steve Wheen makes pothole gardens in London mainly to _ .	"Christmas has never looked as beautiful as it is now, when this one-foot-tall mini tree grew from a pothole in the streets of London. London pothole gardener Steve Wheen , 34 , has created over 150 little gardens so far the smallest one of which is just one-inch-square. ""I really enjoy the reactions of people who come across my work and love them .""said Steve. ""London can be so grey, especially at this time of year. When l was thinking about how to brighten it up, gardening came to my mind."" Steve has been pothole gardening for four years, mainly around the streets of London His pothole gardens are made with some plants he chooses from his local garden centre. Each of them usually costs between five and ten pounds. Although they are often temporary to the streets, Steve is sure that they can be in people's mind for a long time, if they are lucky enough to come across these small gardens while they go about their daily lives. ""I'm always surprised when I ask people what they think the message is behind my Work .""he said. ""Often they think I'm against or in honor of something. One person even considered that l was marking the places where people had died in car accidents.""

Why are some people worried about RFID technology?	"Imagine you're at a party full of strangers. You're nervous. Who are these people? How do you start a conversation? Fortunately, you've got a thing that sends out energy at tiny chips in everyone's name tag . The chips send back name, job, hobbies, and the time available for meeting-whatever. Making new friends becomes simple. This hasn't quite happened in real life. But the world is already experiencing a revolution using RFID technology. An RFID tag with a tiny chip can be fixed in a product, under your pet's skin, even under your own skin. Passive RFID tags have no energy source-batteries because they do not need it. The energy comes from the reader, a scanning device ,that sends out energy (for example, radio waves)that starts up the tag immediately. Such a tag carries information specific to that object, and the data can be updated. Already, RFID technology is used for recognizing each car or truck on the road and it might appear in your passport. Doctors can put a tiny chip under the skin that will help locate and obtain a patient's medical records. At a nightclub in Paris or in New York the same chip gets you into the VIP (very important person) section and pays for the bill with the wave of an arm. Take a step back: 10 or 12 years ago, you would have heard about the coming age of computing. One example always seemed to surface: Your refrigerator would know when you needed to buy more milk. The concept was that computer chips could be put everywhere and send information in a smart network that would make ordinary life simpler. RFID tags are a small part of this phenomenon. ""The world is going to be a loosely coupled set of individual small devices, connected wirelessly,"" predicts Dr.J.Reich. Human right supporters are nervous about the possibilities of such technology. It goes too far tracking school kids through RFID tags, they say. We imagine a world in which a beer company could find out not only when you bought a beer but also when you drank it. And how many beers accompanied by how many biscuits. When Marconi invented radio, he thought it would be used for ship-to-shore communication. Not for pop music. Who knows how RFID and related technologies will be used in the future. Here's a wild guess: Not for buying milk."	['Because their private lives will be greatly affected.']
What is the main idea of the passage?	If you have ever experienced jet lag ,you know how much of a drag it can be. Jet lag happens as a result of air travel, when traveling between two or more time zones. Your body is used to operating in a certain time zone, and when its timing is affected, you're likely to have problems. Edward Norton's character in the movies Fight Club faces the struggle of jet-lag-induced sleeplessness due to his constant traveling. Sleeplessness is just one of the effects of jet lag, and it can lead to other problems, such as tiredness, memory loss and confusion. That's not something you should have to fight on a business trip and it certainly won't make your vacation very enjoyable, either. Sleeplessness is the biggest problem for travelers that suffer from jet lag. Don't worry. You can do something to prevent it. Modify Your Body Clock To prevent the effects on your body's timing that come with crossing time zones, you need to change your body clock sooner, rather than later. You can do this by putting yourself on the same time as your destination time zone before you fly. If you know that you will be traveling to London from the eastern United States, you'll have a five-hour time difference to deal with. Plan for it. Avoid Heavy Food and Alcohol Part of the pleasure of flying commercially, especially if you fly business or first class, is taking advantages of the food and drinks. If you want to avoid jet lag, though, you should think twice. Eating heavy food will only make the jet lag worse. It isn't good to drink alcohol during a flight, either, because it may make you drowsy. Wait until your body adjusts before you decide to have heavy food or drink alcohol.

By eating a balanced diet, your body gets the _ important nutrients it needs.	Your body works 24 hours a day. It's always building and repairing, feeding and cleansing itself. Its goal is to be ready for your every movement, breath, and thought. The quality of your life depends on how well your body works. And how well your body works depends on how much energy it gets. Energy comes from the food you eat. Food contains nutrients that your body needs for growth and energy. By eating a balanced diet, your body gets the six important nutrients it needs.Minerals are nutrients that build bones and teeth. Minerals also form red blood cells and other substances.Wateraids digestion and waste removal.Carbohydrates give your body its main source of energy. Two carbohydrates are sugars from foods such as fruits and vegetables and starches found in rice, potatoes, and bread.Fatshelp build cell membranes .Proteinsrepair and grow body tissues . Finally,vitaminshelp your body use carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The United States Department of Agriculture(USDA) has created a nutritional food pyramid . It shows the daily number of servings you should eat from five food groups. The food pyramid has four levels. The base of the pyramid is the largest level. It contains the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group from which you need six to eleven servings. The next level has two food groups: vegetables and fruits. The USDA recommends three to five servings of vegetables and two to four servings of fruit. The third level also has two groups: the milk, yogurt, and cheese group and the meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts group. You need two to three servings from each of these groups. The top of the pyramid is the smallest level. It contains fats, oils, and sweets. These foods have few nutrients, so eat them sparingly .	['six']
According to the author, the use of technology in the classroom may _ .	Students and Technology in the Classroom I love my blackberry -- it's my little connection to the larger world that can go anywhere with me. I also love my laptop computer,as it holds all of my writing and thoughts. Despite this love of technology, I know that there are times when I need to move away from these devices and truly communicate with others. On occasion, I teach a course called History Matters for a group of higher education managers. My goals for the class include a full discussion of historical themes and ideas. Because I want students to thoroughly study the material and exchange their ideas with each other in the classroom, I have a rule -- no laptop, iPads, phones ,etc .When students were told my rule in advance of the class, some of them were not happy. Most students assume that my reasons for this rule include unpleasant experiences in the past with students misusing technology. There's a bit of truth to that. Some students assume that I am anti-technology. There's no truth in that at all. I love technology and try to keep up with it so I can relate to my students. The real reason why I ask students to leave technology at the door is that I think there are very few places in which we can have deep conversions and truly _ complex ideas. Interruptions by technology often break concentration and allow for too much dependence on outside information for ideas. I want students to dig deep within themselves for inspiration and ideas. I want them to push each other to think differently and make connections between the course the material and the class discussion. I've been teaching my history class in this way for many years and the evaluations reflect student satisfaction with the environment that I create. Students realize that with deep conversation and challenge, they learn at a level that helps them keep the course material beyond the classroom. I'm not saying that I won't ever change my mind about technology use in my history class, but until I hear a really good reason for the change, I'm sticking to my plan. A few hours of technology-free dialogue is just too sweet to give up.	['keep students from doing independent thinking']
When and where will England play its third group stage match?	"England will play Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica in a tough Group D at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Roy Hodgson's men open their campaign against Italy in the Amazonian city of Manaus on 15 June in the only World Cup game which kicks off at 02:00 BST. England take on Uruguay on 19 June and play Costa Rica five days later. Hosts Brazil are in Group A with Cameroon, Mexico and Croatia while the World Cup holders Spain open with a repeat of the 2010 final against Netherlands. England will have to travel 1,777 miles from their chosen base in Rio for their first match in the tropical heat of Manaus. Earlier this week Hodgson described Manaus as ""the place to avoid"" because of the climate--temperatures reach 30C and humidity is about 80%--although after the draw the England boss took comfort from the fact his team face a fellow European side. ""The conditions in the north will be tough, so we will both be in same boat,"" he said. ""If we'd had three games up in the north, it would have been difficult."" Following Hodgson's initial comments, the mayor of Manaus, Arthur Virgilio, said England would not be welcome in the city. England takes on two-time champions Uruguay in Sao Paulo and they play Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte--both cities are within 225 miles of their base. England have never previously beaten Italy or Uruguay at a major tournament , while they have never faced Costa Rica. Uruguay, who reached the semi-finals in 2010, and Italy, who knocked Hodgson's men out of Euro 2012, are ranked sixth and seventh respectively in the Fifa rankings while Costa Rica are 31st in the world - 18 places below England."

Why do international coffee companies consider opening businesses in India?	"India is traditionally a tea-drinking country. But, it is now gaining a new taste for coffee. This has led international coffee companies to consider opening businesses in the huge market. Local business people are also hoping to profit from the country's tea-drinking habits. They want to open new stores that offer tea. It is ten thirty in the morning in India. Two cafes are within meters of each other, near a college in New Delhi. And they are selling a lot of tea. Their main customers are undergraduate students. ""We have a lot of break between classes, so whenever we get time, we just go and we enjoy ourselves. It's a lot of fun , especially when you are with people you enjoy spending time with."" In the past ten years , cafes have become increasingly popular in India. The country's huge young population have quickly taken to the coffee culture. Coffee stores have spread from major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai to smaller towns. Coffee use has doubled in the last ten years . It is the success of this market that has gained the attention of companies like the American-based coffee chain Starbucks. The company will open its first store in India later this year. Other companies like Lavazza and Costa Coffee are already there. Yet, the growth of coffee will not reduce the popularity of tea. Indians drink eight times more tea than coffee. They have been drinking tea for more than one hundred and fifty years. India is one of the world's biggest producers of tea, which is known locally as ""chai"". Outside homes and offices, it is mostly sold by small businesses on the street."

What can be inferred from the passage?	"A man enters a store to buy milk. He walks out of the store with milk. That is all--milk. At the same time, a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk. She buys it. But, she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking, men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Doing many things at one time is often called ""multi-tasking,"" a very popular word these days. Now scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently. Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In the female brain, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of ""reason"". The right hemisphere is known as the ""creative"" side. Regina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something complicated they might use different parts of the brain. But men generally use just one. As a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the ""understanding"" and the ""action"" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain, like the part connected with ""reason"" and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution. Thanks for your listening. I'm your announcer Anna Matteo."	['Women usually deal with a problem indirectly.']
A good title for this passage is _ .	After a day of work and play, the body needs to rest. Sleep is necessary for good health. During this time, the body recovers from the activities of the previous day. The rest that you get while sleeping enables your body to prepare itself for the next day. There are four levels of sleep, each being a little deeper than the one before. As you sleep, your muscles relax little by little. Your heart beats more slowly, and your brain slows down. After you reach the fourth level, your body shifts back and forth from one level of sleep to the other. Although your mind slows down, from time to time you will dream. Scientists who study sleep state that when dreaming occurs your eyeballs begin to move quickly (although your eyelids are closed). This stage of sleep is called REM, which stands for rapid eye movement. If you have trouble falling asleep, some people recommend breathing very slowly and very deeply. Other people believe that drinking warm milk will help make you drowsy. There is also an old suggestion that counting sheep will put you to sleep.	['Sleep.']

What had a piece of Canadian waterweed cause?	Everywhere man is altering the balance of nature.He is facilitating the spread of plants and animals into new regions, sometimes deliberately, sometimes unconsciously.He is covering huge areas with new kinds of plants, or with houses, factories, slag-heaps and other products of his civilization.He exterminates some species on a large scale, but favours the multiplication of others.In brief, he has done more in five thousand years to alter the biological aspect of the planet than has nature in five million. Many of these changes which he has brought about have had unforeseen consequences.Who would have thought that the throwing away of a piece of Canadian waterweed would have caused half the waterways of Britain to be blocked for a decade, or that the provision of pot cacti for lonely settlers' wives would have led to Eastern Australian being overrun with forests of Prickly Pear? Who would have prophesied that the cutting down of forests on the Adriatic coasts, or in parts of Central Africa, could have reduced the land to a semidesert, with the very soil washed away from the bare rock? Who would have thought that improved communications would have changed history by the spreading of disease-sleeping sickness into East Africa, measles into Oceania, very possibly malaria into ancient Greece? These are spectacular examples; but examples on a smaller scale are everywhere to be found.We make a nature sanctuary for rare birds, prescribing absolute security for all species; and we may find that some common and hardy kind of bird multiplies beyond measure and ousts the rare kinds in which we were particularly interested.We see, owing to some little change brought about by civilization, the starling spread over the English country-side in hordes.We improve the yielding capacities of our cattle; and find that now they exhaust the pastures which sufficed for less exigent stock.

Parents come to the Institute because they want _ .	"An American psychotherapist Glenn Doman wrote a best-selling book calledHow to Teach Your Baby to Readin 1963. Now translated into 17 languages, this book arose from his work with brain-damaged children in Pennsylvania. Doman and his team of specialists had wondered why brain-injured children didn't improve with treatment. Then they realized that orthodox methods of treatment only relieved the symptoms, not the problem, which of course was the brain itself. So they develop a new approach. ""All we do for all the children here is to give them visual, auditory and tactile stimulation with increased frequency, intensity and duration, in recognition of the orderly way in which the brain grows,"" says Doman. ""The result was that by 1960 we had hundreds of severely brain-injured two-year-olds who could read and understand."" The team had discovered that even children who had half their brains removed could, by stimulation, achieve higher IQs than the average normal child. Then the team began to think if such amazing results could be achieved with brain-damaged children, what would happen if the same treatment were given to normal children? So eight years ago the Better Baby Institute was opened for the benefit of normal children. The same stimulating environment was provided, and by the time the children left, around seven years old, they could generally speak and read three foreign languages, play a musical instrument, read three full-length books a week and do all the other things that a so-called ""normal"" child could do. In Doman's view, the child's passion to learn during the years up to six must be fed. He believes that, like muscles, the brain develops with use, especially so in those first few years. Nowadays, parents come from all over the world to Pennsylvania to see and learn from the workof Doman and his team; they want to discover how they can fulfill their roles as nature's teachers, by using their love, understanding and instincts for the benefit of the children. For in the words of Doman, ""every child born has a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci used""."	['to develop their own abilities to help their children']

What skill of the students studying the arts can help with problem-solving?	A recent British study examined the salaries and jobs of people who spent time enjoying the arts when growing up. They found those who enjoyed the arts from an early age had better jobs and higher salaries than those who didn't. What's the link ?How could visiting a museum, enjoying a symphony ,or improving painting skills lead to career success? Other studies have found that students who study the arts exercise their reasoning ability. This skill helps with problem-solving. Creative and critical-thinking abilities are also developed through art study. When faced with a real-life challenge ,these skills can be put to good use. The best kind of art excites our imagination and makes us think. Paintings aren't just pretty pictures. They tell stories about the experience of the painter. See Michelangelo's art, and you will taste the power of his faith in God. Look at the world from Picasso's point of view, and you see everyday life in new ways. In Shakespeare's plays you'll find lessons about character and morality .Chinese poet Li Bai brings the wonder of nature's beauty to every reader. The arts show and explain the world beyond our own personal knowledge. When we look beyond ourselves, we can appreciate the experience of people from different walks of life.

If we travel by car, we can _ .	We can not live a modern life without traveling. The fastest way of traveling is by air. With a plane one can travel in one day to places which it took a month or more to get to a hundred years ago. Traveling by train is slower than by plane, but one can see the country he is traveling through. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dinning-cars. They make even the longest journey enjo yable.

Christmas Eve is _ .	On Christmas Eve, the night before Christmas Day, children are very happy. They put their stockings at the end of their beds before they go to bed. They want Father Christmas to give some presents. Father Christmas is a very kind man. He comes on Christmas Eve. He lands on top of each house and comes down the chimney into the fireplace and brings children a lot of presents. Christmas Day always begins before breakfast. Children wake up very early. They can't wait to open the presents in their stockings. Then they wake up their parents and shout 'Merry Christmas!' Do you know what Christmas means? Christmas Day is the birthday of Jesus Christ. When Christ was born, many people gave him presents. So today, people still do the same thing to children.	['the night of 24 December']

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"Reader Janet Maynard has a lot of young bushes in her garden and is suffering from "" _ . So for Janet and anyone else who doesn't want to waste time, effort and water, here are my top tips for keeping plants refreshed in thirsty times. Water in the evening if possible, rather than leaving it till you see things suffer. That way the roots can take up the water in cool soil overnight. Violently jetting hoses mess up the soil structure and may expose delicate roots. Use a rose on a can. Aim low - don't waste water wetting leaves, even though they look pretty and ""refreshed"". The most valuable and easily damaged plants need the most attention, such as newly planted trees, bushes and climbers. Remove any water-keeping mulch you may have put around the base, then water it thoroughly at least two gallons, slowly. Don't aim your can rose at the stem - which we all usually tend to do. Aim the water in a wide circle so that the whole of the area under the plant is watered. You could even make a channel in the soil right around the plant so that the water is held in place as it soaks in. Replace the mulch. Repeat each week even in showery weather for the first summer. How much water for pots? Fill up the gap between the top of the soil and the top of the pot. Let the water soak right in and then fill it again. Do this daily in hot weather for most summer potted plants. Stand pots in saucers - it makes a big difference. But remember to check that the plants are not sitting in water for days on end when the weather turns wet. Roots will rot. If the fertilizer in pots really dries out, the water may get straight out of the pot without being absorbed. Correct this by standing or floating the pot in a bucket of deep water until it sinks and no bubbles rise. A push-button watering can makes for more efficient watering, and recycled water bottles upside down with a needle which has a hole on the end are useful, too, for pots."	['Put potted plants in saucers in case the roots rot in damp weather.']
According to the passage, what is an effect of having a lot of homework?	Middle school students have far too much homework. They usually have to sit up three or four hours every night doing their homework. Now one school in my hometown has made a rule of limiting homework. The homework is limited to an hour a day and the students have no homework on the weekend. I think this is an excellent idea that will allow students to live better and healthier lives. Less homework will give students more time to enjoy other pastimes .I have many books which I received as gifts from my parents and friends. They have been kept there on my shelf for several years! Because of homework, I will have not read a single one of them. With less homework, students will be freer to develop their interests in art, music and other hobbies. More time free from homework will get our physical health better. Many students like sports, but they have little time to play football, basketball, volleyball and so on. They hardly have time to have a trip or take part in any social activities. They must spend so much time solving math problems and doing grammar exercises. Besides, staying up late to finish their homework leaves many students exhausted in the morning. Not getting enough sleep is not only unpleasant; it also makes students more likely to get colds and other illnesses.	['Students have little time for their hobbies.']

If the ring was far from the others, we can conclude that the weather of that year was _ .	Do you know anything about the history of weather? Don't look at the sky. Don't look for old weather reports. Looking at the tree rings is more important. Correct weather reports date back only one century, but some trees can provide an exact record of weather even further back. It is natural that a tree would grow best in a climate with plenty of sunlight and rainfall. It is also expected that little sunlight or rainfall would reduce the growth of a tree. The change from a favorable to an unfavorable climate can be found out by the reading pattern of rings in a tree trunk. To find out the weather of ten years ago, you can count the rings of a tree trunk from the outside to the inside. If the tenth ring is far from the other rings, then it is certain that plenty of sunny and rainy weather occurred. If the rings are close together, then the climate was bad for the tree. Studying trees is important not only for the history of weather, but also for the history of man. In an area of New Mexico you can find only sand -- no trees or people. However, many centuries ago a large population lived there. They left suddenly. Why? A scientist studied the pattern of the rings of dead trees that had grown there. He made up his mind that the people had to leave because they had cut down all the trees. Trees were necessary to make fires and buildings. So, after the people destroyed the trees, they had to move. In this example studying tree rings uncovered an exciting fact about the history of man.	['favorable']
The author mentions the story of the ancient king to show that _ .	"""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."" You probably heard those lines in grammar school, but do you really agree that harsh or negative words do not harm us? Words have power. Surely we all have had our feelings hurt by something someone said. We may not say words to hurt others, but the way we interpret them and how we say them may cause great harm. Here's an example An ancient king dreamed all his teeth had fallen out. He sent for a wise man to explain his dream to him the dream means that all your relatives will die and you will be left alone! The king was very angry and threw the interpreter into prison. He then sent for another interpreter who said, ""Congratulations! King! You will live many more years. In fact, you will survive all your relatives. Long Live the King!"" Both interpreters gave the same interpretation, but there was a huge difference in the way they said it. Our speech must be understood by those who hear our words, but the way we say things and the intention behind them have as much power as the words themselves. Words can cause anger or appreciation. Which would you rather receive? People who say harsh and negative things may not mean to harm, but have you ever known anyone who is a _ ? They often look at the dark sides of things. They always see the glass as half empty rather than half full. How do you feel when you are around this type of person? Remember words have power. Use them wisely."

Mr. Tsui _ .	"Alan Tong was the worst driver in town. He had an accident of some kind almost every week. Alan lived with his mother. His mother was always worried about him. Every day she worried that police would turn up to arrest him. This wasn't a foolish worry because they usually called on the Tong household about once a week to deliver a speeding ticket or to serve him notice to appear in court. Most of his accidents were caused by his carelessness. He drove through red lights. He turned right without signaling. He drove at night without proper lights. He overtook other cars on hills and sharp curve. In short there wasn't a traffic regulation Alan had not broken, and he had had so many accidents that it was a miracle he was still alive. But luckily for Alan, he had never hurt anyone in his accidents or even gone to the hospital. Although Alan wasn't popular with the police, he was very popular with his lawyer. Alan's lawyer, Mr.Tsui, had earned a lot of money from Alan's cases and always rubbed his hands expectantly when he saw Alan coming into his office. One day Alan was working in the garage spraying painting his car when his mother walked in. ""What are you doing?"" his mother asked. ""Painting my car,"" Alan replied. ""I can see that,"" his mother said, ""but why are you painting one side of the car red and the other side blue?"" ""Because every time I have to go to court for a traffic offense, there are always two witnesses . ""What color1 was the car?"" the prosecutor always asks, and the two witnesses always give the same answer. Well, in the future, one witness will say it was blue. Mr. Tsui will then say to the judge, ""Your honor, the witnesses cannot even agree on the color1 of the car involved in the accident."" And the judge will have to dismiss the case against me."

How many sun-powered cars took part in the race?	"It's not the flashiest car in the world. Not even close.

They named their car after Helios, the sun god in Greek mythology . The 4-year-old Tour de Sol encourages the use of ""green"", or environmentally friendly, cars to help reduce pollution and save energy. It' s not a race.

What is the main idea of this passage?	"In the days following the first anniversary of my dad 's death, I felt sad. I still missed him so much. I would walk over to his old house where my daughter now live and still expect to see him sitting out on his front porch . I would see him in my dreams, looking young and strong again. I felt bad too because I regretted not spending more time with him while he was here. I wished I had visited him more, talked with him more, and listened to him more. I wished I had asked the questions that I never did. I wished I had given him more hugs and told him I loved him more often. I wished I had cherished the time I had with him here. I was angry at the destiny because Dad and Mum had both passed away before I was 50, and I was angry with myself because I hadn't made the most of time I had with them. Today, I found myself walking under a cloudy sky, staring at the leafless trees. As I walked along, one of the last golden maple leaves fell from its tree and sailed in the wind until it landed in front of me. I picked it up and smiled. At the moment of peace I felt a sound in my heart and mind: ""death is momentary , but love is eternal ."" I knew at that moment that my relationships with Mum and Dad were not over. We would see each other again in a place of love, joy and light. We would spend our days in learning, laughter and love."	['Life is limited but love is forever.']

Why did the author write a letter to her teacher in 2005?	Dear Mr Rupp, The day I met you was the first day of high school. We liked each other immediately. You gave me a lot of advice over the next four years, like how I should get my ass to Berkeley where I belonged. I'm still there, by the way. I wish you were still around, too. I remember your laugh, which would start with a rough guffaw and end with a hacking smoker's cough that would make even the most rebellious teenager swear to lay off the cigarettes. I remember the way you didn't lower your standards, yet still refused to give up on us. You were tough on us, and we were tough on you. Love is tough sometimes. The last time I wrote you a letter, it was 2005---four years after I graduated. I had just become a teacher, like you, and it had given me a new appreciation for the work you did with countless high school students over the years. It's hard to say what I'll miss the most about you. There are simply too many memories to sort through those four years, and it hurts to think you'll never read this letter. I want to believe that you knew how much you meant to your family, your students, your community, and your colleagues, but that would be a lot of realization to handle, even for you. You changed the lives of everyone around you. Even now, you are reminding me to cherish life and its brevity and beauty, and to tell the people I love how much they mean to me before it is too late. Dear teacher, dear mentor, and dear friend----I miss you and all that is about you. God bless you in Heaven.

According to Dr Kurt Straif , we can learn that _ .	"Smoggy weather has become common in China. But these days, air pollution levels in the north eastern city of Harbin surpassed the previous record levels. The city was essentially shut down after PM2. 5, fine Particulate pollution that is considered hazardous . reached levels of 1000 micrograms per cubic meter-40 times the safety level remended by the World Health Organization. Schools, motorways and an airport were closed on Tuesday as visibility in some areas of the city dropped to less than 10 meters. Photos from Harbin showed residents covering their mouths with masks and scarves, and moving like ghostly shadows through the fog. Cars and motorcycles are moving slowly as traffic came to a standstill with traffic lights barely visible. . Just days previously , the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified air pollution as a carcinogen . It stated that there is "" sufficient evidence"" that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer and also linked it with an increased risk of bladder cancer. It's said that exposure has increased significantly particularly in "" rapidly industrial countries with large populations"". ""The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances"" , Dr Kurt Straif , head of the IARC said in a press released. ""We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths. "" On the Chinese social media site Weibo , many users complained about the pollution and shared their concerns. References to ""feed people with smog ""have become popular on Weibo and there is a sarcastic play on the expression ""serve the people"" , as the two have a similar pronunciation. ""The impact of air pollution on people will be gradual. There won't be a sudden outbreak of symptoms, but normally three to five days after the smoggy weather occurs, there is a peak in the number of people seeing doctors, "" Deng Ying, a doctor at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University was quoted as saying."

What's the best title for the text?	"Come on! All of us are cutting math. Who wants to take that quiz? We're going to take a walk and get lunch instead. Let's go!"" says the coolest kid in your class. Do you do what you know is right and go to math class, take the quiz? Or do you give in and go with them? People who are at your age, like your classmates, are called peers. When they try to influence you how to act, to get you to do something, it's called peer pressure. It's something everyone has to deal with--even adults. Peers influence your life, even if you don't realize _ , just by spending time with you. You learn from them, and they learn from you. It's only human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group. Peers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Or you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone is reading it. Sometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them. It's difficult to say ""no"" to peer pressure, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. It can really help to have at least one other peer, or friend, who is willing to say ""no"" too. If you continue to face peer pressure and you're finding it difficult to handle, talk to someone you trust, a parent, or a teacher. They can help you feel much better and prepare you for the next time you face peer pressure."	['Peer pressure']
When people hear themselves eating, they can _ .	"The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. ""Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,"" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. ""But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption."" ""For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue in the eating experience."" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of ""food sound salience"" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises. The ones loud enough to mask the sound of chewing made subjects eat more -- 4 pretzels compared to 2.75 pretzels for the ""quiet"" group. In another of their experiments they found that just having people hear chewing sounds through an advertisement can decrease the amount they eat. Elder and Morh call this the ""Crunch Effect."" The main takeaway of their work should be the idea of mindfulness, they said. Being more mindful of not just the taste and physical appearance of food, but also of the sound it makes can help consumers to eat less. ""When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,"" Elder said. ""The effects may not seem huge --one less pretzel-- but over the course of a week, month, or year, it could really add up."" So next time you sit down for a meal, take your headphones off and mute the TV or find a movie where there's a lot of very audible chewing."	['be likely to eat less']
What is the key reason for polar bears' dying out?	. As the world's largest terrestrial carnivore ,the polar bear is the king of the great white north. Adult males can measure more than 9 feet in length and weigh between 770 and 1,430 pounds. The bear's body and neck are elongated, and the head is narrow and long with small, rounded ears. Polar bear populations can be found in northern Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia, and there have been reports that polar bear tracks have been found as far north as the North Pole. The 5,000,000-square-mile range of the polar bear circles the Arctic and contains stretches of open water where seals are easily caught. Polar bears live on the annual Arctic sea ice that provides a platform from which they can hunt. They hunt seals on the sea ice by breaking into seal dens in the sea ice. The dens aren't visible from above,but seeing is less important than smelling to a polar bear -- with their keen sense of smell,polar bears can sense the breathing holes of seals in their dens beneath the snow and ice. As the southern edge of the Arctic ice cap melts in summer, polar bears are stranded on land and spend their summers fasting ,living off body fat stored from hunting in spring and winter. It might come as a surprise that this species faces an uncertain future. Climate change is causing the disappearance of sea ice from which polar bears hunt seals. Sea ice in the Arctic is melting earlier and forming later each year. With about 22,000 polar bears living in the wild,the species is not endangered at the moment, but its future is far from certain. People have reached an agreement that controls the hunting of polar bears and directs each nation to protect their habitats, but it does not protect the bears against the biggest man-made threat to their survival : global warming. If current warming trends continue, scientists believe that polar bears may disappear within 100 years.	"[""The climate is changing due to people's activities.""]"

Very loud music can also be bad for your ears. So even if you are alone when listening to our MP3 players, you shouldn't turn it up too high. Take Them Off! You need to know when to turn your MP3 off and put it away. Libraries, and schools don't allow MP3 players.

Why would you listen to music at a play, a movie or a sporting event? You would miss what is going on and others would wonder why you even came. Take One Out! Once in a while it's okay just to take out one earphone and not the other. Imagine you are listening on your MP3 player when someone asks you the way. It would not be rude to take out one earphone, tell him the way, and put back the earphone and continue listening.

Which of the following escaping way is NOT right? _ .	What are you going to do if you are in a burning house? How will you escape? Do you know how to save yourself? Please read the following passage. Escaping a fire is a serious matter.Knowing what to do during a fire can save your life.It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone in the family,such as stairways and fire escapes,but not lifts. From the lower floors of the buildings,escaping through windows is possible,learn the best way of leaving by windows with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground.An average person,hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground.It is about the height of an average man.Of course,it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help.Be sure to keep the door closed.Or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room.Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may leaked into the room. On a second or third floor,the best windows for escaping are those that open onto a roof.From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely.Dropping onto cement might end in injury.Bushes and grass can help to break a fall.

The whole passage mainly developed _ ?	"_ , or housewives, who have crowded into gold stores across China, buying up 300 tons of gold over the past two weeks. No wonder gold prices have steadied after taking a dive. During the May Day holiday, gold stores were crowded with mostly female customers. Most of them are middle-aged ""Chinese housewives"". This group of buyers has risen to fame recently. They are big spenders and are desperate to get their hands on a bargain. ""I bought some gold jewellery and kept them as a gift for my son when he gets married,"" said a buyer from Shanghai. The gold business is skyrocketing. ""Our sales are growing by the day. Yesterday we sold more than ten million yuan of gold products,"" a gold store salesperson said. The gold rush in China started about two weeks ago thanks to a decline in global gold prices. Media reports suggest that Chinese housewives have spent about 100 billion yuan, or about 16 billion US dollars, purchasing 300 tons of gold since mid-April. That has helped support gold prices. ""Gold prices depressed since the middle of last month but have risen gradually. That is mainly due to the strong demand from Asian markets,"" said foreign trader Zhang Chen from Industrial & Commercial Bank of China.

But nine years passed and Lyonsadmittedly forgot that he was on the donor list--until he got a call in May 2005. Lyons was informed that he was a perfect one-in-seven-million match for a 7-year-old girl. For the next seven weeks, Lyonswent through a series of tests- including several blood tests as well as a lung x-ray to determine whether he was fit to donate. On July 7, 2005, Lyons was checked in to WestPennHospital, where the bone marrow was taken. One half liter of bone marrow was taken during the two-hour operation. The bone marrow was then immediately given to the girl. In August, Lyonsreceived a telephone call from the mother of the girl, Monica Christie, who gave him permission to meet the girl ""Her mother cried on the telephone,"" Lyonssaid.

_ special bookstores inside China are mentioned in the passage.	Bookstores are second homes for readers. Although many people can now buy books online. many readers still like the feeling in bookstores. They can touch the books and smell the print. In China. there are many special bookstores. Sanlian Taofen Bookstore became the first 24-hour bookstore in Beijing at the beginning of April. Popular Holdings in Shanghai is a film-themed bookstore. It has film books and posters. Eslite Bookstore in Taiwan often has activities like talks with famous writers. At the same time. bookstores outside China can be very colorful. too. Scarthin Books is a small bookstore in the UK. It sells new and second-hand books. There are more than 100.000 books lying on the shelves of the store's 12 rooms. Bart's Books in the US is a good place to enjoy the sunshine while reading books. It's an outdoor bookstore. Bookshelves are on the street. When the store is closed. people can still buy books. They just put money into the door's coin box. Where can you find a cafe. bar and bookstore in just one place? The answer is probably El Pendulo in Mexico. Books line the walls of the store. On the second floor. visitors can order everyday meals in the cafe and drinks from the bar. In order to keep cool. there are green plants and trees inside. Does it look like a park?	['3']
What is Wu ming'an's attitude towards the lawyers' behavior of making a lot of debate on the internet before the trial?	"Instead of a normal court hearing, the trial on Wednesday appeared more like a prepared drama. Hundreds of reporters waited outside the court, in the hope of learning ""shocking"" information about the case, which includes well-known military singer Li Shuangjiang's son, who gang-raped a woman with another four men on February. The case was not a public hearing because it includes teenagers, whose privacy must be protected under law, but many details had been exposed by the lawyers before the trial. Lawyers of all five suspects and the woman's lawyer made a lot of debate on the Internet before the trial, making the case more confused. Wu Ming'an, a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law, said it was a pity to see such a ""performance"" by the lawyers. ""It can be understood that the two parties freely spoke their opinions, but it's not professional or wise to see lawyers do the same,"" Wu said. ""Instead, the lawyers should guide and persuade their clients to calm down, especially for such a non-public and sensitive case."" China has no clear rule to manage lawyers' behavior before trials, ""but it should be general knowledge that the lawyers of the two sides cannot _ too many details, particularly in a case that includes teenagers"", Wu added. Yi Shenghua, a lawyer who has been following the case, said it does more harm than good to both parties for such detailed information to be exposed before the trial. ""It's OK for lawyers to speak, but what is said must be reasonable and legal. Although judgments should not be affected by public opinion, it's hard for them not to be,"" he said, suggesting judicial authorities should speak out if the case goes wrongly. Trials must be conducted based on evidence, while lawyers should protect their clients' rights instead of adding fuel to the flames, Yi said. In my eyes, the most important aspect of the case, lies in how to make lawyers do their work more professionally and reasonably."	['critical']
Which of the following is the focus of the story?	"Hilary Smith belonged to a good family.But by the age of twenty, he had spent all the money the good old family had.He then had some trouble with the bank and was put in prison.He escaped from the prison and ran to Australia without delay. Hilary did not like Australia. What he could do seemed to be one of two things: die or work.Then he remembered that he was not alone in the world.He had an aunt. She was his father's only sister, but his father used to say she brought no glory to the family.Hilary, of course, tried to discover what she had done.It seemed that she had failed to marry a nobleman.Instead, she had chosen a husband who was connected with ""trade"".Of course as soon as she became ""Mrs Parks"" ,her brother considered her dead.Later on, Mr Parks died and left her a lot of money; but that did not bring her back to life in her brother's opinion. Hilary discovered his aunt's address.Fortunately she remained faithful and honest to him even after she fell ill.So Hilary's star shone again, and soon he moved into her house and lived as comfortably as a sailor who had just reached harbour.He had only about a six pence in his pocket. One thing was soon clear: his aunt was seriously ill, and nothing could cure her illness.Hilary was very worried.Fate had found a home for him, and was now going to throw him out of it.There was only one thing that could save him: her will. ""Will?"" she said, ""yes, I have made one.That was when I was a girl and had not much money.I left all my money to some religious people."" ""Didn't you make another will when you were married?"" Hilary asked. His aunt shook her head.""No,"" she said in a low voice, ""There was no need.When I finally had a lot of money I found I had no relations."" On the next day he went to the public library and examined a book of law.It told him what he already believed.When a woman is married, an earlier will lose its value.A new will must be made.If no new will is made, the money goes to the nearest relation.Hilary knew that he was his aunt's only relation.His future was safe. After a few months had passed, Hilary's problems became serious.He badly needed money.He had expensive tastes, and owed a lot of money to shopkeepers.They trusted him because his aunt was rich; but the debt was terrible. Unfortunately his aunt did not want to discuss money matters at all.In the end they had a quarrel about the small amount of ten pounds.Hilary was not very angry.He began to wonder about a new problem.Was it kind to want his aunt to live.any longer? Was it not better for her to die now? While he was considering what to do, his aunt told him that she was going to send for her lawyer.So she was going to make a new will, Hilary thought.She might leave all her money to someone else.Soon he reached a clear decision. _ One night when the old servant who had been nursing his aunt went off, he doubled the amount of some medicine.The total amount was too great and it could just put her to sleep forever. ""Thank you,"" his aunt took the glass from his hand with a grateful look.""I want more than anything to sleep, and never to wake up again.Is that what you wish, Hilary? Don't blame me if I have some doubts about what you intended to do.Sick people get these ideas, you know.One thing I ought to explain to you.Mr Parks never married me.He already had a wife and couldn't marry again.That made your foolish father very angry with me...Well, if I am alive tomorrow I shall make another will in your favour.If I die tonight, you'll get nothing...No, Hilary, don't try to take the glass away.If you do that, I shall know and I don't want to know.Goodnight, Hilary."" Then, very carefully, she raised the glass to her mouth and drank."	"[""Hilary's aunt's money.""]"
The author's friend was determined to lose weight when he _ .	"""In reading the lives of great men, I found that the first victory they won was over themselves... self-discipline with all of them came first."" -- Harry S. Truman That is the quotation that had me thinking yesterday. Discipline , in particular self-discipline, is what will get us through most things in life, from writing this simple post to Achieving Greatness for You and I. You may ask, ""Why is discipline important in writing this post?"" For people who have tried writing, you would know how hard it might get sometimes to actually sit down and finish the whole article in one period without getting up every few minutes to get a drink, a snack or toilet break etc. Just with most things in life, often we lack the self-discipline to see us through what we are hoping to do or achieve. One area where self-discipline is clearly important is in losing weight. Some people are constantly looking for quick fix to their weight problem; they will jump at anything that is claimed to help them lose weight in the shortest time. They may lose weight fast, but they will find the result short-term especially if they do not change the way they live and the food they eat. A friend of mine shared his experience going through the journey from 115 kilograms to 56 kilograms in around one year. His journey of losing weight started from a trip with his daughter to the doctor for her check-up. He playfully weighed himself on the weighing machine while his daughter was having the check-up. The doctor saw his weight and made a remark, ""If you maintain that balloon weight, you cannot see your grandchildren."" That made him decide, ""Enough is enough!"" Not only that, he felt tired easily and his excessive weight made him feel like a walking balloon. In that moment of awakening, he made decisions to change his lifestyle and eating habits."	"[""was much touched by the doctor's remark""]"
According to this passage, which of the following can be considered as the behavior of a hero?	"Once many years ago, I pulled a family out of a burning car somewhere in Wyoming. Last week I received a telephone call from a woman who could not stop crying as she told me that one of my stories had saved her son from committing suicide. In closing she called me a hero. That got me thinking about what a hero is. Was I a hero because I pulled a family from a burning car? If so, how could I be a hero just because I wrote a story that saved someone's life? Today I decided to look up the word ""hero"" in the dictionary to see exactly what it meant. It read ""a person who does. something brave"". As I read on, it also said ""a person who is good and noble "". That statement impressed me more than the part about being brave. So I thought about something very important. Say I was walking into the local Wal-Mart Store and I happened to open, and hold the door for someone as a _ . As they passed me by, I say, ""How are you today?"" Most of the time that would be no big deal, but this time let's say it was for someone who was deeply depressed and near the end of the rope. That may have very well been the only kindness or courtesy shown to them in a very long time. Having been near ""the end of my rope"", after my marriage of twenty years ended, I was in such a condition. I was within hours trying to get enough courage to end the pain and misery. When I returned home, someone had sent me a card in the mail which told me how much they would appreciate me as a friend. That wonderful card probably saved my life. That person, without even knowing it, saved a life and became a hero. Gee, who would have ever thought that anyone can become a hero, and possibly save a life just by being kind and courteous to others? The best part of all is that becoming a hero is free to all who wish to wear such an honor."	['Being kind to someone who has a hard time.']
What is the best title of the passage?	"Get ready to cycle your heart out at these local and overseas destinations perfect for cycling. 1. Amsterdam, The Netherlands. With more bikes than people, the city has a large number of cyclists. Low speed limits in the centre control the impact of cars, while bike racks( ) on public transport make it easy to travel long distances. You can also find rental shops everywhere. 2. Berlin, Germany. With over 1000 km of bike paths, the vast majority of which are protected lanes, it's no wonder Berliners love to get around by bike. For the traveller, the major sights are within easy reach on a bicycle. The ""Call A Bike"" share system allows you to simply lock the bike to any fixed object and call in a code to return it. 3. Paris, France. Home to the Velib' public bike sharing system that has over 20, 000 bikes, and with 500km of bike paths, Paris cyclists can enjoy the city safe from motorists. A Velib' station is almost always within sight, or just around the next corner. 4. Tokyo, Japan. Despite being home to one of the most developed public transportation networks on the planet, Tokyo residents still cycle in large numbers. Though the extent of bike lanes is limited, safe drivers ease the tension between car and cyclist. Unique automatic underground bike parking garages are provided when you need to store your bicycle. 5. Perth, Australia. A large part of Perth's intelligent basic facilities are made up of bike paths, which allow commuters to get into and around their city with ease. There are free bike lockers and racks across the city. For the visitor, numerous scenic routes line the coastline and the local Swan River."	['5 Bike-----Friendly Cities']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"As a child, I remember listening to a song called ""Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen."" When I visited the city last year, that song kept running through my head. It got me wondering: Just what is wonderful about Copenhagen? It's not a place filled with world-famous tourist sites. But it does have a charm that makes you want to _ . You can sample the food, visit the castles and museums, and learn about the life of the Danes. Stoget, the world's longest pedestrian mall, runs through the center of the old city. This string of lively street and squares _ I happily explored the mall, looking in the windows of shops and cafes. I followed Stoget from the square in front of the city hall to Nyhavn. Here, old houses painted bright color1s look out over a picturesque harbor filled with sailing ships. Denmark's beloved storyteller Hans Christian Andersen lived here when he wrote his first stories. From Nyhavan, I continued heading north. I wanted to see Copenhagen's symbol, the statue of the Little Mermaid . She was set up in honor of Hans Christian Andersen's famous story. As I continued my city tour, one thing impressed me all the bicycles. I learned that half the population of Copenhagen rides bikes every day. Only 20 percent of Copenhageners own cars because there is a 180 percent tax on them. That certainly keeps the city free of traffic jams and heavy pollution! It's easy to join all the bicyclists pedaling through the streets, too. The city provides free bicycles that anyone can use. The cycling around the castles and parks made a relaxing end to a full day. As darkness fell and the parks' lights began to twinkle, I watched families enjoying themselves. So what is wonderful about Copenhagen? Just about everything."	['The government of Copenhagen does encourage people to ride bicycles.']
This passage mainly discusses _ .	You want to know where the safest place for young children is in the car? For a child of any age, the back seat is the safest place and the safest part of the back seat is the middle. In the back seat, the child is farthest away from the force or effect of head-on collision , which can cause the most injuries. All fifty states of theprefix = st1 /USAhave laws requiring the use of safety seats for young children. If you have children under 8 years of age weighing no more than 80 pounds, it is necessary to fit your car with a special child safety seat. The child safety seat comes in three types or sizes: the first type is designed for babies from birth to one year of age, until the baby weighs about 20 pounds; the second size is for children between one and four years of age, who weigh between 20 and 40 pounds; the third kind is used by older children big enough to use the car's belt system. Moreover, all these safety seats must be fitted and held in place on the car's back seat. If your child does need your attention while you are driving, don't look back. Just pull over . In addition, always be sure your child is properly fastened throughout the entire trip. Children who can unfasten their own car seats are subject to fatal injuries in an accident. Start early in your child's life teaching them that car safety is serious business and make sure you give a good example and always wear your own seat belt.

What brings career women more joy and happiness according to the passage?	"Many independent Chinese women like to earn their own bread, even if their husbands are already bringing home the bacon. But a recent survey suggests that such women find more joy from relationships, rather than successful careers. About 73 percent of the 7,000 women surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou said they would choose to work even if their husbands earned enough for the family. The survey also found that 77 percent define happiness as ""enjoying a relationship"". But striking a balance between career and family can bring challenges to the woman's career advancement. ""In my company, women usually have an equal or even a higher starting salary than men,"" said Li Hua, general manager of Beijing Chuangjiashe Book Circulation Company. ""However, as they begin to climb up the career ladder, women often meet problems along the way, while men can climb the ladder more easily."" Both physical and emotional differences can prevent some women from taking tough positions, Li said. But family life is often the main difficulty for Chinese career women. Despite these challenges, however, some experts believe it's reasonable for some women to want to be breadwinners. ""In this way, the roles of a family are decided by the parents' abilities rather than their gender ,"" said Gu Donghui, a sociology professor at Fudan University. Gu says women should have the freedom to decide if they want to stay at home or work to support the family. ""Everyone has a different interpretation of what it means to find self-worth"". Wang Haibin, an economic expert from Renmin University shares that view: ""Traditionally, we tend to regard the family as the cell unit of society. Some members have always been expected to make sacrifices for it. But, it really doesn't matter who earns more. Economic independence and personal choice is essential for both sexes in the family."""

"In this passage, ""customs"" especially refers to _ ."	In western countries, especially in America, some social customs have lasted still today. For example, ladies first, that is to say, women in those countries are respected in many ways. In the U.S. and Europe, you will see men usually open doors for women and women generally walk ahead of men into a room or a restaurant unless the man have to be ahead of the ladies to choose the table, to open the door of a car or to give other services. On the street, men almost walk or across the street on the side of the ladies which is closer to traffic, but if a man walks with two ladies, he should walk between them.

What happens when prices go up but salaries remain the same?	One of the major problems in our economy is inflation , a situation in which prices are going up faster than salary . Thus, a person has to work more hours to pay for the same thing. For example, let's say that this year a loaf of bread costs $1.00 and average salary in the United Sates is $10.00 per hour. That means a person could earn enough money to buy a loaf of bread in one-tenth of an hour, or six minutes. Then, halfway through the year, the price of the bread goes up to $1.25, while salary stay the same. That means that a person now has to work one-eighth of an hour--seven and a half minutes to buy the same loaf of bread. Now let's say that at the end of the year, salary go up to $11.00 per hour, but the price of bread goes up to $1.50. Now a person has to work more than one-seventh of an hour--over eight minutes--to buy loaves of bread, employees will have less money left over to buy other things, Inflation means that the same money buys fewer things and everybody's standard of living goes down, even if salaries are going up. Some kinds of inflation are worse than others. Moderate inflation does not distort relative prices or incomes seriously. Galloping inflation happens rapidly, say at a rate of 100percent or more within a year. And then there's hyperinflation--inflation so serious that people try to get rid of their currency before prices rise further and make the money worthless. Times of hyperinflation are usually characterized by social and political disorder.	['People must work longer to buy the same things']

Jack London _ when he began to write his books.	"As you know, the great American writer Jack London was often in need of money when he began writing his books. He worked hard but it didn't help him. Once he promised a New York magazine to write a story for it, but he was busy at that time and could not keep his promise. The boss of the magazine wrote letters to Jack London several times to ask him to send the story. At last he went to Jack London's room and left a note . ""Dear Jack London, if I don't get the story in twenty-four hours, I'll come to your room and kick you downstairs, and I always keep my promise."" Jack London read the note and answered, ""Dear Dick, if I could do my work with my feet like you, I could keep my promise, too."""	"[""didn't have enough money""]"
What is the author's general attitude towards the book?	Science has a lot of uses. It can reveal laws of nature, cure diseases, make bombs, and help bridges to stand up. Indeed science is so good at what it does that there's always a temptation to drag it into problems where it may not be helpful. David Brooks, author ofThe Social Animal, The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement, appears to be the latest in a long line of writers who have failed to resist the temptation. Brooks gained fame for several books. His latest bookThe Social Animal, however, is more ambitious and serious than his earlier books. It is an attempt to deal with a set of weighty topics. The book focuses on big questions: What has science revealed about human nature? What are the sources of character? And why are some people happy and successful while others aren't? To answer these questions, Brooks surveys a wide range of subjects. Because of this, you might expect the book to cover a variety of facts. But Brooks has structured his book in an unusual, and perhaps unfortunate way. Instead of introducing scientific theories, he tells a story, within which he tries to make his points, perhaps in order to keep the reader's attention. So as Harold and Erica, the hero and heroine in his story, live through childhood, we hear about the science of child development and as they begin to date we hear about the theory of sexual attraction. Brooks carries this through to the death of one of his characters. On the whole, Brooks's story is acceptable if uninspired. As one would expect, his writing is mostly clear and, to be fair, some chapters stand out above the rest. I enjoyed, for instance, the chapter in which Harold discovers how to think on his own. While Harold and Erica are certainly not strong characters, the more serious problems withThe Social Animallie elsewhere. These problems partly involve Brooks's attempt to translate his tale into science.	['Critical.']
The police took the boy away because _ .	The Internet has become part of teenagers' life. A new report shows that 38 percent (......) of 3,375 students use the Internet often.

The guy could only think that it was the most beautiful smile he had ever seen and stuttered , ""'Well, I'd like to buy a CD."" He grabbed the first one he saw.""Do you want me to wrap it?"" the girl asked. The guy said yes and then took the wrapped CD home. From that day on he visited the music store every day, and each day he bought a CD, and each day the girl wrapped it up and the guy stored it unopened in his closet. He was too shy to find the nerve to ask the girl out.His mother noticed this and encouraged him. The next day the guy set out for the store with a determined mind. He bought a CD and the girl wrapped it as usual.While she was busy , he left his telephone number on the counter and rushed out of the store. The following day the guy didn't visit the store.When the girl called him, his mother answered the phone and started crying.The girl asked her what was the matter.""He died yesterday,"" the mother said. There was a long silence. Later that afternoon the guy' s mother entered his room and opened his closet.To her surprise, she saw a big pile of unopened CDs wrapped in festive paper.With curiosity she tore open the package and noticed a slip of paper ""Hi! You're cute; I would love to meet you.Let's go out some time.Sophie."" The mother started crying as she opened another, and another.Every single CD contained a slip of paper that said the same.

According to the passage, the purpose of the health reform plan in the UK is to _	It seems that politicians around the world are thinking about the health of their countries. While in China, Chen Zhu has announced his plans for a universal health service and reform across health services. Gordon Brown, the UK Prime Minister, has also announced he is planning to make some changes in our health service. The crux of Mr. Brown's proposals are related to giving the NHS (National Health Service) a greater focus on prevention, rather than just curing patients. He is planning to introduce increased screening for common diseases such as heart disease, strokes, and cancer, for example, breast cancer. In Britain there are 200,000 deaths a year from heart attacks and strokes, many of which might have been avoided if the condition had been known about. Initially, the diagnostic tests will be available for those who are vulnerable, or most likely to have the disease. One example is a plan to offer all men over 65 an ultrasound test to check for problems with the main artery , a condition which kills 3,000 men a year. The opposition have criticized Mr. Brown's proposals, saying that they are just a trick, and claiming that there is no proper timetable for the changes. They also say that Mr. Brown is reducing the money available for the treatment of certain conditions while putting more money towards testing for them. The NHS was founded in 1948, and is paid for by taxation. The idea is that the rich pay more towards the health service than the poor. However in recent years there has been a great increase in the use of private healthcare, because it's much quicker. NHS waiting lists for operations can be very long, so many people who can afford it choose to pay for medical care themselves.	['focus on the prevention rather than on curing the patient.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	In the past, man did not have to think about protection of the environment. There were very few people on the earth, and natural resources seemed to be unlimited. Today things are different. The world has become too crowded. We are using up our natural resources too quickly, and at the same time we are polluting our environment with dangerous chemicals. If we continue to do this, human life on the earth will not survive. Everyone realizes today that if too many fish are taken from the sea, there will soon be none left. Yet, with modern fishing methods, more and more fish are caught. We know that if too many trees are cut down, forests will disappear and nothing will grow on land. Yet, we continue to use more powerful machines to cut down more and more trees. We realize that if rivers are polluted with waste products from factories, we will die. However, in most countries waste is still put into rivers, but there are few laws to stop this. We also know that if the population of the countries in the world is to rise at the present rate in a few years, there will not be enough food. What can we do to solve these problems? If we eat more vegetables and less meat, there will be more food available for everyone. Land that is used to grow crops can feed five times more people than land where animals are kept. Our natural resources will last longer if we learn to recycle them. The world population will not rise so quickly if people use modern methods of birth control. Finally, if all of us think about the problem, we will have a better and cleaner planet in the future.	['If we eat more vegetables, more food can be saved.']
which way didn't Ms. Lightner use to achieve her MADD's goals?	"In 1980,Candy Lightner's 13-year-old daughter Cad was killed by a drunk driver as she walked down a suburban street in California. ""I promised myself on the day of my daughter's death that I would fight to make this needless accident count for something positive in the years ahead,"" Candy Lightener later wrote. The drunk driver received a two-year prison sentence. However, he avoided prison by serving time in a work camp and a halfway house. Ms. Lightner was very angry about that and so organized Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD), which later changed to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The aim of her organization was to raise public awareness of the serious nature of drunk driving and to promote tough legislation against the crime. Before Ms. Lightner's MADD, intoxication , including drunk driving, was not taken seriously. Intoxication was often used as an excuse for otherwise unacceptable behavior: ""I didn't know what I was doing--I was drunk."" Candy Lightner appeared on major television shows, spoke before the US Congress, addressed professional and business, groups, and worked tirelessly for years to change public attitudes, change judicial behaviour, and promote tough new legislation. Ms. Lightner left MADD because the organization that she herself created is changing its focus. ""I didn't start MADD to deal with alcohol. I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving."" The President of the United States awarded her the President's Volunteer Action Award and she was the subject of the movie ""Mothers Against Drunk Drivers: the Candy Lightner Story""."

We can infer from the passage that .	Do you like listening to music? Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit of measure called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution.	['noise is a serious problem']
Which fact shows that a woman is confident?	"With a PS4 million ITV contract in her pocket and an engagement to her England footballer boyfriend, it's been a good year for Christine Bleakley.Perhaps it's no wonder, as the TV presenter is 31, the age at which women are the most attractive, according to a survey. While the average British woman of 31 may be married with a child, the survey noted they are at a wonderful age because they have not only youthful beauty but also more confidence and a better sense of style than flesh-faced teenagers. Some 70 percent of more than 2,000 men and women surveyed considered confidence as a key factor in making a woman attractive, ahead of the 67 percent who included physical beauty and 47 percent who looked for a sense of style.Almost two thirds of the women agreed with the opinion ""With age, comes beauty"", and over half said that as they age they do away with their insecurities and feel more beautiful, while 55 percent felt they knew the best make-up to wear. Self-confidence varied widely across the country in the survey: London women emerged as the most confident about their looks, with 37 percent describing themselves as beautiful, compared with just 28 percent of Welsh women.Meanwhile, East Midlands women spend the most on beauty programs --PS129.69 monthly--compared with a national average of PS105.50. The research was carried on for TV shopping channel QVC to mark the launch of its ""Beauty Month"".QVC marketing director Sue Leeson said: ""This research shows what many have always suspected -- real beauty is about more than just good looks but a combination of confidence, style and personality, too."""

What do you think of Steve Jobs according to the passage?	"""Three apples have changed the world. One is for Eve, one is for Newton. The third is in the hands of Steve Jobs."" said someone. Steve Jobs was the former CEO of the Apple computer company in his parents' garage on April Fool's Day, 1976. Through many years' hard work, Jobs and his Apple products were a great success. People believe he has made the world a better place. Many young people also think of Apple products as a fashion icon. Because of his great achievements in this area, he was honoured with a number of awards, including the National Medal of Technology in 1985, the Times cover character and the Most Successful Manager in 1997. Jobs' road to success wasn't an easy one. He experienced several ups and downs, but he was still standing. Just as Hemingway in The Old Man and the Sea said, ""A man can be destroyed, but not be defeated . So he was considered as an American hero. What did Jobs' workers and family members think of him? On one hand, some workers described him as a strange, bad-tempered boss. They said he was impatient with those who disagreed with him or didn't understand his ideas. On the other hand, his family members thought of him as a home-loving dad with each of his four children. He worried about all the things of them, such as their boyfriends, travel, safety and even skirt length. Though he was quite busy, he still attended his daughter's graduation party."	['Home-loving.']
Which of the traditional fairytales tells one can get away with stealing?	"Is traditional fairytales good all the time? Recent research found one in five parents have abandoned those old classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Hansel and Gretel and they're in favor of more modern books. One third of parents said their children have been left in tears after hearing the terrible details of Little Red Riding Hood. The survey of 2,000 adults was carried out to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM, which starts tonight at 9:00 pm on Watch, and sees six series based on traditional fairytales. The research found a quarter of parents wouldn't consider reading a fairytale to their child until they had reached the age of five, as they cause too many awkward questions. And 52 percent of the parents said Cinderella didn't send a good message to their children as it portrays a young woman doing housework all day. Similarly, Goldilocks and the Three Bears was also a tale likely to be left on the book shelf as parents felt it condones stealing. Steve Hornsey, General Manager of Watch, said: ""Bedtime stories are supposed to relax the children and send them off to sleep soundly. But as we see in GRIMM, fairytales can be dark and dramatic tales so it's understandable that parents worry about reading them to young children. As adults we can see the innocence in fairytales, but a five year old with an over active imagination could think they are true. Despite the dark nature of classic fairytales, as we see in GRIMM, good will defeat evil and there is always a moral to the story."" Though half of parents said traditional tales are more likely to have a strong moral message than a lot of modern kids' books, two thirds of mums and dads said they were no longer appropriate to soothe youngsters before bed. On the contrary, they might give their children nightmares."	['Goldilocks and the Three Bears.']
The main purpose of the passage is to _ .	Fencing or Not Wildlife fences are constructed for a variety of reasons including to prevent the spread of diseases, to protect wildlife from poachers , and to help manage small populations of threatened species. Human-wildlife conflict is another common reason for building fences. Wildlife can damage valuable farm animals and crops. Some species carry diseases of agricultural concern, and a few threaten human lives. At the same time, people kill wild animals for food, trade, or to defend lives or property, and human activities destroy wildlife habitat . Separating people and wildlife by fencing can appear to be a _ beneficial way to avoid such harmful effects. But in a paper in the journal Science, published recently, some scientists argue that fencing should only be used if worse comes to worst. According to the scientists, although fencing can have conservation benefits, it also has costs. When areas of wildlife habitat are changed into islands, the resulting small and isolated populations tend towards extinction, and the resulting loss of larger-bodied species can affect interactions between species in ways that cause further local extinctions. Therefore, scientists are asking that conservationists carefully weigh up the biodiversity costs and benefits of new and existing fences. In addition to fences' ecosystem-wide impact, the scientists don't think they always achieve their specific aims. Construction of fences to reduce human-wildlife conflict has been successful in some places but the challenges of appropriate fence design, location, construction, and protection mean that fences often fail to deliver the anticipated benefits. In some places, fences also provide poachers with a ready supply of wire for making traps. A variety of alternative approaches, including better caring for farm animals, community-based crop-guarding, insurance and wildlife-sensitive land-use planning are suggested to reduce conflicts between people and wildlife without the need for fencing. Some projects working with local people and government agencies in Indonesia have shown that human-elephant conflict can be dramatically reduced without using fences. The scientists conclude that as climate change increases the importance of facilitating wildlife mobility and conserving landscape connectivity, fence removal may become an important form of climate change preparation, and so fencing of wildlife should be avoided whenever possible.

Britain has improved their water quality by _ .	We always read reports about costs of oil going up and we will think this is our most valuable material. However, water is the most valuable resource . People in the Middle East are more worried about this than oil. Maybe the next war will be about water. In the future, to control the quality and quantity , you will use different water for different usages. The water used to wash your car, water your flowers or wash your clothes doesn't need to be as clean as the water you drink. One in five people live in countries without enough fresh water and in 25 years, the number is believed to be one in every three people. Our world population is increasing. What do you suppose this will suggest for us in the future? Population control? Traditional management of the water industry has been out of date since the 1990s. When technologies develop so rapidly in the world, we have loads of information for technologies in the business world, but in the water industry we don't have any. Britain and France have already taken measures to successfully improve their water industries. All the water services in Britain have been provided by private companies since 1991. Since then, improvement has been made in the rules for their water quality and pricing. What can you do now for the future? Using water more efficiently in your house can make a great difference not only to the world but to your money. Even if you don't have to pay much now, you will when you start to pay big prices for different water usages.	['changing the management of the water industry.']
Which of the following sentences is NOT true?	Put 2 February in your diary! It is World Wetlands Day! It marks the date that the Convention on Wetlands was signed in1971.This special day was first celebrated in 1997 and it is celebrated every year. The celebration is a call for action. It is a way to show people how important and useful the wetlands are for people. On World Wetlands Day, people around the world take part in many wetlands activities. People take trips to the local wetlands. There are talks about how important the wetlands are. People get together to clean up their local wetlands Children draw pictures to advertise the day. People also compete in boat races. The World Wetlands Day is important! If there are no wetlands, there will be no water for anyone in the future. Wetlands help protect nature and resources like fresh water. Already, more than 10000 million people in the world do not have fresh water. Many people do not know how important the wetlands are. They can understand why an elephant or a tiger is important because they are big, beautiful animals. It is much harder for them to understand how important the animals in the wetlands are. These small animals, such as frogs and snails, play a very important part in keeping the balance of nature. All plants and animals are part of the food chain .If the small wetlands animals die, some animals in the food chain will have nothing to eat. They will also die. People need the wetlands to keep the balance of nature in the world. If we do not protect nature today,it will be gone tomorrow.	['People celebrate World Wetlands Day by talking about the weather.']

Every year, Tara Atkins-Smith collects warm clothes from her community in order to help the less lucky. This year, since the family was traveling to Halifax with their daughter Jayda and seven of her friends to celebrate her 8thbirthday Tara thought it was the perfect time to teach the chidren a valuable life lesson. The kids spent time handing out coats to the homeless and tied the rest around light poles for others to pick up. Each of the clothes had a tag that read, ""I am not lost. If you are caught in the cold, please take me to keep warm. "" According to Tara, the experience helped the children better understand the difficult situation of homeless people, who have to brave the cold winter on the streets. ""When we got back in the car after an hour on the street, they were all freezing cold and crying for the heater to be on because they were cold , "" she said. By next morning, all the jackets, gloves, and scarves on the poles were gone. Photos of the inspriring project have been shared about 8, 000 times on Facebook, and have got over10,000 likes.

Why are germ-free mice easy to develop lung inflammation?	"A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. The study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. Now, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. In the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . Dr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been ""educated"" by early exposure to germs. Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. Rob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing. ""Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things"", says Rob Dunn."

Alibaba's advantage mainly lies in _ .	"Alibaba started taking the lead in China, simply enough, by connecting big Chinese manufacturers with big buyers across the world. Its business-to-business site, Alibaba.com allowed business to buy almost everything. Alibaba's advantage wasn't hard to identify: size. Alibaba is just big, even by Chinese standards. Its marketplaces attract 231 million active buyers, 8 million sellers, 11.3 billion orders a year--and _ It encourages people to use its markets--not charging small sellers a percentage of the sale. If you want a quick look into the influence of Alibaba on daily Chinese life, take my experience. I moved to Beijing almost a year ago and quickly got tired of visiting small stores across the crowded, polluted city of 20 million people in search of new electronics, bathroom furnishings, and anything else my wife wanted. ""You're looking for what exactly? Why not try _ ? "" my Chinese teacher asked me one day. With that, my wonderful new relationship with Alibaba began. Alibaba's original business-to-business model now is secondary to consumer buying. Chinese retail buying makes up 80% of Alibaba's profit, and leading that group is Taobao, with 800 million items for sale and the most unbelievable selection of things you'll ever find. TMall.com is Alibaba's other big site, where you can find brand name goods from Nike and Unilever near the lowest prices. What I have a hard time explaining to friends and family back in the U.S. is how China has gone beyond traditional shopping--big-box retailers especially --in favor of online purchases on Taobao and a few other sites. In smaller towns than Beijing, where big retailers have not yet traveled, shopping online is shopping, and shopping is Taobao. I have a list of some of my recent purchases on Taobao for a sense of how extensive the marketplace is. Almost everything arrived a day or two after ordering with free shipping. I'm not even a big buyer, because I need friends to help me search the Chinese-language site. When I was searching my purchase history on my Chinese teacher's iPad, which helps me buy goods, I looked through with great difficulty about 10 of her purchases for every one of mine."

What can we learn from the passage?	"One night, the first floor of the house suddenly caught fire. The fire was big, and soon became a sea of fire. On the second floor lived a little girl and her grandmother; the little girl's parents had died, and she lived together with her grandma. In order to rescue the little girl, the grandmother was burned to death, leaving the little girl crying for help loudly. How could people enter the house? At the very moment, a man carrying a ladder rushed to the flames and got into the window. When he appeared again in the eyes of the people, the little girl was in his arms. He gave the child to the crowd, and then disappeared into the night. This little girl had no family. Two months later a meeting was held to find a person to adopt the girl. A teacher was willing to adopt this child, and said she could give her the best education; a farmer wanted to adopt this child, saying that village life would let the child grow up healthily and happily; a rich man said, ""I can give the child everything that others can do."" A lot of people who wanted to adopt this child said about many benefits of their adopting the child. But the little girl's face had no expression. At this time, a man, through the crowd, walked straight in front of the little girl, and opened his arms for the little girl. People were puzzled, and they found that the man had terrible scars on his arms. The little girl let out a cry, ""This is the man who saved me!"" She suddenly jumped up, and buried her face in his arms and sobbed. Naturally the man adopted the girl."	['The girl recognized the man and was happy to be adopted by him.']
What is Margaret Morrissey's opinion about the new program?	"Poorer children would be offered the chance to attend lessons on Saturday to help catch up with their middle-class peers , the shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, said today. The Conservatives would give English state schools the freedom to choose to have longer teaching hours and extra classes at the weekend; he told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference. Gove said the move would help to close the achievement gap with richer children whose parents could afford extras such as tutoring and music lessons. He told delegates in Manchester, ""For children who come from homes where parents don't have the resources to provide _ and cultural experiences, there are benefits in having those children in the learning environment, in school, for longer."" ""Parents would love to have schools starting earlier in some circumstances, and certainly going on later in the afternoon, given the reality of their working lives,"" he said. He held up the example of Kipp (Knowledge Is Power Program) schools in the US, which are often based in the poorest communities and open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, plus Saturdays. But it would be up to schools to decide to offer longer hours, Gove added. Parents said Saturday classes could become a ""badge of dishonor"" if pupils were forced to go while teachers raised concerns about their workload. Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, said, ""I think the suggestion the government made about one-to-one teaching for these kids would be a more preferable way of improving these children's performance. I'm just not sure whether taking away a child at weekends is actually going to make them cleverer in the week."" The ATL's general secretary, Mary Bousted, said, ""If we want Saturday schools, then we need more teachers doing the extra hours, not the same teachers working longer."""	['Doubtful.']

This passage mainly teaches us _ .	Rules of safety are made to keep people from getting hurt. It is important for everyone to learn how to live safely while at home, work, or play. You should always remember this. Put safety first. Safety can be practiced at home by following some simple rules. Use ladders instead of stepping up on tables and chairs. Keep stairs well lighted and clear of things for someone to trip over. Fasten down loose rugs. Turn handles of pots inward from the edges of stoves. Keep matches and medicines out of the reach of small children.Keep electric wiring in good repair. Safety at work has been getting attention from groups of people for many years. Safer machines have been built to cut down on accidents. Red lights warn when equipment is out of order and is not to be used. The proper shoes, gloves, robes, hats, or coats help protect workers on the job. Safety at play is important, too. Children should use swings and slides properly. Common sense by people boating and swimming will also help everyone around stay safe. Good manners and care for others are part of safety. Living safely can be fun for you as well as for those around you, You will be able to help others think before they act. Try to work for safety in everything you do.	['we should do things safely']
"Why are participants less likely to form words like ""ethical"", ""moral"" in the afternoon?"	"People are more likely to lie or cheat during the afternoon because self control reduces during the day, according to researchers. Volunteers taking part in two experiments where they could benefit by cheating were more likely to do so if the tests took place after midday, researchers found. The findings back up previous studies which have shown that our capacity for self-control declines during the day, due to tiredness and repeatedly making decisions. Psychologists from Harvard University first showed a group of volunteers various patterns of dots on a computer screen, asking them to decide whether there were more dots on the left or the right hand side. Instead of being rewarded for getting the answer right, the participants were paid based on which side they chose, earning ten times as much for choosing the right hand side as the left. People who were tested after midday were significantly more likely to select the right hand side, even if there were clearly more dots on the left, than those who took part during the morning. In a second test, participants were shown a series of word fragments , such as ""--ral"" and ""e--c--"" and asked which words they associated with them. In morning experiments, participants were more likely to form the words ""moral"" and ""ethical"" while during the afternoon the words ""coral"" and ""effects"" were most common. Further tests conducted online showed that people were more likely to send dishonest messages or claim to have solved an unsolvable problem in the afternoon than in the morning. Writing the Psychological Science journal, the researchers said the difference was particularly _ in people with higher ethical standards, who always behaved morally during the morning but slipped during the afternoon. In contrast, those who were able to ""morally disengage"", or behave unethically without feeling guilty, tended to cheat whatever the time of day. Dr. Maryam Kouchaki, one of the lead authors, said ""Unfortunately, the most honest people, such as those less likely to morally disengage, may be the most susceptible to the negative consequences associated with the morning morality effect."" The findings could be relevant to organizations that should be more alert about the behavior of customers and employees during the afternoon, she added. ""Our findings suggest that mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally."""	['Because self control declines after midday.']
Which of the following statements is right according to the passage?	World Wrestling Entertainment is the largest professional wrestling organization in North America. It was called World Wrestling Federation until it changed its name because of a legal dispute. Its more than one hundred wrestlers fight each other in competitive matches that are written and practiced before they are performed. Professional wrestlers are athletes but act as entertainers. They are not seeking athletic records, but instead want to excite an audience. To do this, they use unusual names and wear special clothing during wrestling matches. These wrestlers include the Stone Cold Stunner and the Undertaker. Most professional wrestling matches are between two men or two women. They fight inside an area called a ring that is separated from the audience by ropes. Each match continues until one wrestler forces the other's shoulders to the floor and holds them there for a count of three. Most World Wrestling Entertainment matches continue for only about four to seven minutes. An organization official called a promoter decides before the match who will win. But who wins and who loses is not the important thing in professional wrestling. The important thing is that the audience enjoys the pretend fight. Some wrestlers rarely win, but continue to be popular. Not all wrestling matches are between two people. Some are called tag team matches and involve teams of two, three or four wrestlers. Another kind of match is called a battle royal. It involves thirty to sixty wrestlers competing against each other. A wrestler loses when he or she is thrown out of the ring. The winner is the last wrestler still standing.	['Wrestlers usually wear special clothing to look funny.']
The purpose of this passage is _ .	Thirty-two people watched kitty Genovese being killed right beneath their windows. She was their neighbor. Yet none of the 32 helped her. Not one even called the police. Was this in gunman cruelty? Was it lack of feeling about one's fellow man? Not so, say scientists John Barley and Bib Fatane. These men went beyond the headlines to probe the reasons why people didn't act. They found that a person has to go through two steps before he can help. First he has to notice that is an emergency . Suppose you see a middle-aged man fall to the side-walk. Is he having a heart attack? Is he in a coma from diabetes ? Or is he about to sleep off a drunk? Is the smoke coming into the room from a leak in the air conditioning? Is it steam pipes? Or is it really smoke from a fire? It's not always easy to tell if you are faced with a real emergency. Second, and more important, the person faced with an emergency must feel personally responsible. He must feel that he must help, or the person won't get the help he needs. The researchers found that a lot depends on how many people are around. They had college students in to be tested. Some came alone. Some came with one or two others. And some came in large groups. The receptionist started them off on the tests. Then she went into the next room. A curtain divided the testing room and the room into which she went. Soon the students heard a scream, the noise of file cabinets falling and a cry for help. All of this had been pre-recorded on a tape-recorder. Eight out of ten of the students taking the test alone acted to help. Of the students in pairs, only two out of ten helped. Of the students in groups, none helped. In other words, in a group, Americans often fail to act. They feel that others will act. They, themselves, needn't. They do not feel any direct responsibility. Are people bothered by situations where people are in trouble? Yes. Scientists found that the people were emotional, they sweated, they had trembling hands. They felt the other person's trouble. But they did not act. They were in a group. Their actions were shaped by the actions of those they were with.	['to explain when people will act in emergencies']
We can infer that if a teacher uses controlled anger, _ .	"We all know the saying, ""One's enemy is one's own anger and one's calmness is the friend of oneself."" Anger is the root cause of many bad outcomes. We all know of damage that anger has caused us. There are many old stories that tell us the bad effects of anger. But the question is whether we should never experience anger and lead lives like sages ?I do not think the answer is a firm yes. Everyone should have this emotion and be able to use it in a wise way. In other words, it is also known as controlled aggression. We see a lot of this kind of controlled emotion when we watch athletes in action. If an athlete has the right amount of aggression, the game or the battle is half won. The other half can be won by his skills. Controlled aggression or anger also plays an important role in a person's career and life. During the courses of a person's career, people who hold high positions need to exercise this emotion called anger in a professional and right manner. For getting the work done well, it is important for you to make use of positive aggression or controlled anger. We can extend this to our daily lives as well. If the parent is not strict at times, children will behave in a wrong way and do not develop as they are expected. Teachers have to exercise this emotion in a wise way to make the students gain knowledge in an effective manner. All in all, if one is able to use the emotion called anger in a controlled manner, it will lead to the smooth development in his life and career."	['his students may get good grades']
When the writer was a high school student,she _ .	"When I was fifteen months old.I fell on a glass rabbit which cut my eye badly enough to blind it.And as I grew,this sightless eye , in so many ways controlled me that I walked with my face looking at the floor so people would not see the ugly me. Yet Mama would hold me in her arms and stroke my hair and say,""If you hold your head up high,it will be OK.And people will see your beautiful soul.""She continued this message whenever I wanted to hide. As a little child,I thought Mama meant,""Be careful or you will fall down or bump into something because you are not looking.""As a teenager, I found that my mama's words helped me begin to realize that by letting people look at my face,I let them recognize the intelligence and beauty behind my eyes. In high school I was successful both academically and socially.I was even elected class president,but inside me I still felt like a freak .When things got really bad,I would cry to my mama and she would look at me with loving eyes and say, ""Hold your head up high and face the world.Let them see the beauty that is inside."" When I met the man who became my partner for life,we looked each other straight in the eye,and he told me I was beautiful inside and out.Mama's love and encouragement were the spark that gave me the confidence to overcome my own doubt.

Which of the following is NOT true?	"When we're little, our mother is the center of our attention, and we are the center of hers. So our mother's characteristics leave an indelible impression, and we are forever after attracted to people with her facial features, body type, personality, even sense of humor. If our mother is warm and giving, as adults we tend to be attracted to people who are warm and giving. If our mother is strong and even-tempered, we are going to be attracted to a fair-minded strength in our mates. The mother has an additional influence on her sons: she not only gives them clues to what they will find attractive in a mate, but also affects how they feel about women in general. So if she is warm and nice, her sons are going to think that's the way women are. They will probably grow up to be warm and responsive lovers and also be cooperative around the house. Conversely, a mother who has a depressive personality, and is sometimes friendly but then suddenly turns cold and rejecting, may raise a man who becomes a ""dance-away lover"". Because he's been so scared about love from his mother, he's afraid of commitment and may pull away from a girlfriend for this reason. While the mother determines in large part what qualities attract us in a mate, it's the father--the first male in our lives--who influences how we relate to the opposite sex. Fathers have an enormous effect on their children's personalities and chances of marital happiness. Just as mothers influence their son's general feelings toward women, fathers influence their daughter's general feelings about men. If a father _ praise on his daughter and demonstrates that she is a worthwhile person, she'll feel very good about herself in relation to men. But if the father is cold, critical or absent, the daughter will tend to feel she's not very lovable or attractive. In addition, most of us grow up with people of similar social circumstances. We hang around with people in the same town; our friends have about the same educational backgrounds and career goals. We tend to be most comfortable with these people, and therefore we tend to link up with others whose families are often much like our own."

If an Englishman has much money, _ .	British society is considered to be divided into three main groups of classes--the Upper Class, the Middle Class, and the Lower or Working Class. This is known as the Class system and it is important to know something about it if you want to understand British people and society. Most British people grow up with a deep knowledge and understanding of the class system even if they are not very conscious of it. Most people know which class they belong to by the way they speak, their clothes, their interests or even the type of food they eat. Social class is not only about behavior and attitudes. For example, although many upper class people are rich and may own a lot of land, having a lot of money does not make a person upper class. It is also important to come from a particular kind of family, have friends who are considered suitable, have been to a certain type of private school and speak with the right kind of accent. There are people who are poor but who do not think of themselves as working class, because their family background, education, political opinions, etc. are different from those of most working-class people. Many people do not like the class system but it is impossible to pretend that these differences do not exist or that British people do not sometimes form opinions in this way.	['he is not likely to be from the upper class']
From the text, we can draw a conclusion: _ .	"In 1996 I wanted to buy a Honda Civic. I went to the local dealer. ""Oh, you want a Civic, do you?"" said the fellow. ""And I suppose you'd also like us to throw in a couple of front-row Superbowl tickets? Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!"" When his laughter ended, he explained that the Civic was such a hit in Europe that Honda was getting an extra $ 2,000 per car there, making Civic practically unavailable in the States. But he did offer to let me add my name to the waiting list--if I agreed to pay $1,000 over the sticker price. When Honda dealerships No. 2 and No. 3 gave me the same story, I was ready to try anything. I carefully looked over to www.autobytel.com. For a _ like me, Auto-By-Tel's scheme is nearly irresistible. You indicate the car you want to buy, compete with the freedom to choose. The nearest participating car dealer mails you back with a cut rate offer. There's no charge for any of this -- and no obligation to accept the offer. It surely seemed no less to me. Sure enough, two days later, a dealer 30 minutes away wrote me. ""Unfortunately, 96 Civics are in very short supply,"" his message said, ""The best we can offer you is $1,200 under sticker price. ""I was in happiness. Ah! Bliss! Ah, saving! Ah, revenge! When I picked up the car, it got better. Since there was no haggling , the dealership fellow was friendly and congratulatory instead of everything. Now this, I thought, is the way to buy a car. Auto-By-Tel makes money by charging a fee to each participating dealer. The dealers make money by receiving hundreds of ready-to-buy customer names off the Web. And you save money because your price doesn't reflect advertising, test drives, sales commissions, and so on. My only regret is that I didn't think up Auto-By-Tel first."

According to the passage there were _ blue sky days in the first quarter of last year in Beijing..	"Beijing--No Car Day was first started by 34 cities in France on September 22, 1998. It was started to protect the environment. By now, more than 1,000 cities around the world have had a No Car Day. The first No Car Day in China was in Chengdu in 2001. Other cities, including Beijing, Taipei, Shanghai and Wuhan also support the day. In Beijing, more and more people are joining in the activity.

Choose the most suitable title for the article.	"The Hawaiian Islands are situated about two thousand miles away from North America, right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Despite the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world. They use the mauka andmakaisystem.Maukameans ""mountain"". The mountains in Hawaii are always at the center of the islands, as these are volcanic islands.Makaimeans ""the sea"". The islands are small and the system is simple. Wherever you want to visit, it can always be described in terms of where it lies in relation to the mountains and the sea. A typical conversation between a native Hawaiian and a tourist might go as follow. TOURIST: Excuse me! Could you tell me where the Sheraton Hotel is? HAWAIIAN: Well... Let me see! From here it's two blocks mauka, and then one blockmakai. You can't miss it!"	['The Hawaiian Islands.']
Which of the following best describes the function of early musical training?	"New findings show that musical training affects the structure and function of different brain areas, how those areas communicate during the creation of music, and how the brain interprets and combines sensory information. The findings were presented at Neuroscience 2013, the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience and the world's largest source of emerging news about brain science and health. These views suggest potential new roles for musical training including training plasticity in the brain, offering an alternative tool in education, and treating a range of learning disabilities. Today's new findings show that long-term high level musical training has a broader effect. Researchers found that musicians have a better ability to combine sensory information from hearing, touch, and sight. The age at which musical training begins influenced brain structure and its function. Beginning training before the age of seven has the greatest effect. Even older adults who took music lessons as children but haven't actively played an instrument in decades have a faster brain response to a speech sound than those who never played an instrument, according to a study appearing November 6 in the Journal of Neuroscience. The finding suggests early musical training has a lasting, positive effect on how the brain deals with sound. ""Playing a musical instrument is a multi-sensory and motive experience that creates emotions and movements--from finger tapping to dancing -- and engages pleasure and reward systems in the brain. It has the potential to affect brain function and structure when done over a long period of time,"" said Gottfried Schlaug, MD, PhD, of Harvard Medical School, press conference speaker, also an expert on music. ""As today's findings show, musical training brings about new processes within the brain, at different stages of life, and with a range of effects on creativity, cognition , and learning,"" he added."

Which of the following sentence in the passage is TRUE?	You may feel interested in students in other countries. Do they have so much homework? What do they do in their free time? People did a survey in China, Japan, South Korea and the US last year. This is the result. Who studies the hardest? Chinese students spend the most time in studying. About half of Chinese students spend more than two hours on their homework every day. Who sleeps most often in class? Japanese students fall asleep in class more often. About 45% of them sometimes _ in class. It's 32% in South Korea, 21% in the US and 5% in China. Who is the most distracted ? American students are the most active in class, but also the most distracted. 64.2% of them chat with friends in class. 46.9% of them eat something in class, and 38.9 % of them send e-mails or read other books in class.

Most South Korean students watch TV.	['Some American students send e-mails in class.']
During the test, the people were given _ .	Will it matter if you don't have your breakfast? A short time ago, a test was given in the United States. People of different ages, from 12 to 83, were asked to have a test. During the test, these people were given all kinds of breakfasts, and sometimes they got no breakfast at all. Scientists wanted to see how well their bodies worked when they had different kinds of breakfasts. The rules show that if a person eats a right breakfast, he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast. If a student has fruit , eggs, bread and milk before going to school ,he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class. The result is opposite to what some people think. Having no breakfast will not help them lose weight. This is because they are so hungry at noon that eat too much for lunch. They will gain weight instead of losing it. You will lose weight if you reduce your other meals.	['different breakfast or sometimes none']
The best title for the passage may be _ .	Every day, life is made and lost. Every day, life goes on. Every day we experience some of the most important parts of life and may not even realize it: love, generosity, and perseverance. These values aren't just important to us, they make the world what it is. Scientists say that the gravity makes the world turn, but some people say that love makes _ go around. Love can be found anywhere: in families, friends, even strangers. Even if you can't see it, you know it's there. Love may connect people all over the world, but what would the world be without generosity? Whether after a national disaster or a school fund raiser, one thing is certain--- it is better to give than to receive. Generosity is found everywhere and whether it's a large or small act, it makes a difference. Most of all, generosity is not something you need any qualifications for, and no matter what you do, it can make a difference. Sometimes, though, it takes effort to be generous, which leads us to perseverance. Founding a country, riding a bike, or finishing a novel, these are all finished with perseverance. Perseverance is the one thing that can help us achieve whatever we want. It is what helps scientists discover cures for illnesses, and athletes become winners. You may fail, but every time you make a mistake, that's one less to make the next time. There is an infinite number of things we value. But without love, generosity, and perseverance, we just don't think that our lives or the world would be the way it is.	['Three values']

From the passage we can know that _ .	Sharks frighten most of us, but Daniel Weaver, a shark scientist, swims with them for a living! We asked him some questions about this unusual job. So Daniel, what's it like to be a shark scientist? Well, it's a great job. I often travel to faraway places like South Africa and Fiji to study sharks. On the other hand, a shark scientist sometimes does boring desk work, such as writing reports. Also, shark scientists don't usually get paid a lot. What qualities do you need to become a shark scientist? Shark scientists need to be wise and strong. They enjoy working outdoors and they have to be cool and patient . They also have to be quite brave! So do you think it's a dangerous job? Well, sharks have up to 15 rows of sharp teeth. However, sharks hardly attack humans. There are over 350 kinds of sharks in the world and only about 10 are dangerous to us. In fact, dogs kill more people every year than sharks! Humans kill over 12 million sharks a year for food and sport! How do you become a shark scientist? A shark scientist usually studies _ or _ at university. It's also good to get some work experience in an aquarium . In my opinion, I have the best job in the world!	['humans do more harm to sharks than sharks do to humans']

Obama suggested the students should _ .	"Last week, President Barack Obama gave a back- to-school speech to students at the Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Students in schools across the country also tuned in to watch the President's speech on TV.

Paying attention in class. Doing your homework. Studying for exams. Staying out of trouble. "" Obama encouraged students to embrace what makes them different. ""We shouldn't be embarrassed by the things that make us different,"" he said. ""We should be proud of them."" He also suggested taking advantage of all of the opportunities at your school, and always being open to trying new things. ""Just because you're not the best at something today doesn't mean you can't be tomorrow,"" he said. ""Even if you don't think of yourself as a math person or as a science person--you can still _ those subjects if you're willing to make the effort.

What caused Luis Ortiz to feel sick and headaches?	A California man who was feeling sick almost died recently from a shocking cause. 26-year-old Luis Ortiz went to a hospital because of a headache and nausea(,). When doctors examined him, they were shocked to find a tapeworm larva in his brain. The story gets stranger. The larva was still alive. The creature had caused a cyst to form inside his head. The cyst was restricting the flow of liquids to different areas of his brain. The situation was so serious that doctors said they had to perform an emergency operation to remove the larva. A doctor who operated on Ortiz told him he had only 30 minutes to live. When the doctor pulled the worm out of his head, it was still moving. Luis Ortiz was a student at California State University in Sacramento. He began experiencing headaches in late August. But Ortiz said he did not think the headaches were serious. In September, he visited a friend and his parents in another city. That is when the pain got worse. His mother saw Ortiz throwing up and took him to a hospital emergency room. The doctors saved Ortiz's life. However, the surgery also affected him. Ortiz had to drop out of school and move back home. For now, he is not permitted to work or drive a vehicle. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. has about 1,000 reported cases of tapeworms each year. The CDC adds that tapeworms are more common in developing countries with poor public health systems. The best way to avoid a tapeworm infection is to wash fruits and vegetables. Also, make sure meat is cooked thoroughly. The CDC suggests cooking all meats to an internal temperature of at least 63 degrees Celsius.	['A living creature in his brain.']
Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"European Day of Languages falls on 26 September. BBC News Online reported the attitudes across several European Union countries to languages. Tamsin Smith, Rome, Italy Italians place very high importance on learning languages, particularly English. Twenty years ago it was quite difficult to find an English speaker here but today it is quite easy. The strong influence of American and English culture helps young people to learn the English language. They often become familiar with it through ""Harry Potter"" books or Disney movies. English schools, where Italian children are taught all their lessons in English, are also becoming popular among rich Italians. Lucien Libert, Paris, France Languages are very important in France. A good knowledge of the English language is necessary for many Frenchmen to get a good job and the more languages you can learn, the better. English is the first language you learn in school and you start very young. Most people have at least eight years of learning English at school. Learning German or Spanish comes next and Latin is also taught in most schools. While French people learn languages, there is also a movement to protect the French language. James Helm, Dublin, Ireland The English language predominates in Ireland, but the ancient Irish language is a lasting source of pride and interest, and it remains a living tongue that is used in several areas. School are required to teach ancient Irish, and most students learn it as part of the subjects. There is a continuing discussion about how to protect the language best. In recent years some primary schools have introduced foreign language classes for younger students, and the Irish government has tried to encourage schools to offer more languages such as French, Spanish, German and Italian."

Which of the following is TRUE about the Project?	In the year 1986 there was a terrible explosion . The explosion was at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. The radiation caused a lot of damage. It polluted the soil and other things. People were living in the area when the explosion happened. More than twenty years later those people are still suffering. The _ of the explosion will go on for a long time. Over two million people still live in that area. Only 56 people died from the explosion but many other problems have been caused because of it. Some types of cancer are more than 200 times above the world average . Many children have cancer now and children born with problems have doubled since the accident. Some people in the United States are worried about the children living in the explosion area. One group has been trying to raise money. They are called the Chenobyl Children's Project. They want to bring children from Ukraine to the U.S. each summer. A spokesperson for the group says that radiation is the highest in the summertime so it is a good time to get the children out of the country. They want to help the children get away for a little while. The Project wants them to be safe from radiation. It costs $1,500 to bring each child to the United States for six weeks. The group raised enough money to bring 28 children to the United States last year. The children were able to do lots of fun things. They enjoyed clean air, healthy food, and plenty of outdoor fun. One little nine-year-old girl who got to come to the United States said that she likes America. The spokesperson says that the children that come to America during the summer miss less school when they return home because they have a long summer vacation.

. You come across a new or doubtful word when you are reading, you can _ .	"Learners report two main difficulties in reading, which may be linked. There are too many unknown words and as a result reading is simply not a pleasure. For some students, even reading in their own language is a chore. Having a wide vocabulary is essential to making sense of written language. Of course, this is a circular argument, because the more you read the more vocabulary you learn and the more words you know the more easily you can read. Don't make the mistake of reading with your dictionary beside you, looking up every single new or doubtful word. This is laborious and prevents you from practicing the skill of prediction. Sometimes in reading you find a word you know but the sense doesn't seem to fit in. This is not surprising because words have so many meanings and degrees of meaning. What is more, part of their meaning is shaped by the words around them. Keep looking at the surrounding words and asking yourself ""what sort of meaning would make sense here?"" The more that people study the reading process, the better they can pass on to language learners a range of advice to choose from. People have learned to read in all kinds of ways. Here is some information that could help you plan to be a better reader in the foreign language you are studying. 1)Work out the general meaning first When people read in a new language they often feel they must take a detailed approach, focusing on every word, particularly those they don't know. They read as if they were using a microscope, looking carefully at each of the small pieces(the individual words), but not necessarily seeing the whole picture at first. This is called the ""bottom-up"" approach. Other readers try to look first at the big picture(the ""top-down"" approach), attending to individual bricks only as necessary, a process that involves some intelligent guesswork. Generally this second approach is recommended by successful learners. 2)Interactive reading Another way of thinking about reading is to describe it as an interactive process, where the text brings something to you and you bring something to the text. Readers bring together all their knowledge of the world with what they see on the page in front of them. That is why, when reading in our own language, we don't need to read every word. We add meaning which is not actually stated. 3)From supported reading to independent reading Language learners start by needing considerable support as they read. Textbooks supply this support in the form of introductions that summaries the contents, glossaries, pictures, explanations of new grammar points. In your reading you need to move gradually from this support to reading more the text itself."	['keep looking at the surrounding words']
The reason why there was great interest in Flight STS-51-L is that _ .	The majority of astronauts from America have been men. At the start of the space programme there was strong resistance from some people against having women in space. However, some women were very keen to become astronauts and in the end they were successful. In 1978, NASA began the first training programme for women astronauts. Judy Resnick and Christa McAuliffe were both astronauts and they were both women, but in many other ways they were very different. Both of them were on Flight STS-5L-L. Judy Resnick was born in 1949 and studied engineering at university and went on to obtain a PhD in 1977. She was a member of the first group of women selected for astronaut training in 1978, and in 1984, she became the second woman in space. During that flight, she helped to launch three new satellites and she carried out a programme of research. She was, in many ways, a professional astronaut whose whole life was devoted to space travel. Christa McAuliffe was born in 1948 and she was an astronaut almost by accident. In 1984, NASA decided to find a teacher who could accompany astronauts into space. They hoped that she would be able to communicate with students from space and encourage every one of them to be interested in space travel. Christa was a secondary teacher in history and social studies. She was a gifted teacher and she was selected from over 11,000 applicants to go on flight STS-51-L. She was also a very good communicator and she immediately established a very good relationship with the news media(radio, television and newspapers). It was partly because of this that there was a great deal of interest and excitement about the flight. Thousands of students in schools and universities all around the country were looking forward to communicating with Christa in space. Millions of people were watching her flight with great interest. It is partly because of the excitement over McAuliffe's place in the flight that the disaster in 1986 had such an effect on people.	['a young secondary school teacher was on the flight']
In what place is climate change greatest?	"The USA, New York--Whales and dolphins are facing increasing threats from climate change, according to a new report published by WWF and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS). The report ""Whales in hot water?"" draws attention to the growing impacts of climate change on whales.They range from changes in sea temperature and the freshening of the seawater because of the melting of ice and increased rainfalls, to a sea level rise, loss of icy polar habitats and the _ of krill populations in key areas.Krill, a tiny shrimp that is dependent on sea ice, is the main source of food for many of the great whales. The speeding up of climate change adds greatly to trouble from other human activities, such as chemical and noise pollution, which kills some 1000 whales every day. ""Whales and dolphins have an ability to adapt to their changing environment,"" said Mark Simmonds, International Director of Science at WDCS.""But the climate is now changing at such a fast pace that it is unclear to what extent whales and dolphins will be able to adjust."" Climate change impacts are currently greatest in the Arctic and the Antarctic.According to the report, cetaceans that rely on polar, icy waters for their home and food resources are likely to be greatly affected by the reduction of sea ice cover. WDCS and WWF are urging governments to cut global production of C02 by at least 50 percent by the middle of this century.The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed it was possible to stop global warming if the world's emissions start to decline before 2015."

What would be the best title for the text?	"In 1901, H.G. Wells, an English writer, wrote a book describing a trip to the moon. When the explorers landed on the moon, they discovered that the moon was full of underground cities. They expressed their surprise to the ""moon people"" they met. In turn, the ""moon people"" expressed their surprise. ""Why,"" they asked, ""are you traveling to outer space when you don't even use your inner space?"" H.G. Wells could only imagine travel to the moon. In 1969, human beings really did land on the moon. People today know that there are no underground cities on the moon. However, the question that the ""moon people"" asked is still an interesting one. A growing number of scientists are seriously thinking about it. Underground systems are already in place. Many cities have underground car parks. In some cities, such as Tokyo, Seoul and Montreal, there are large underground shopping areas. The ""Chunnel"", a tunnel connecting England and France, is now complete. But what about underground cities? Japan's Taisei Corporation is designing a network of underground systems, called ""Alice Cities."" The designers imagine using surface space for public parks and using underground space for flats, offices, shopping, and so on. A solar dome would cover the whole city. Supporters of underground development say that building down rather than building up is a good way to use the earth's space. The surface, they say, can be used for farms, parks, gardens, and wilderness. H.G. Wells' ""moon people"" would agree. Would you?"	['Building down, not up.']

According to the passage, former young people were expected to _ .	"In the past, young people inprefix = st1 /Japanwere expected to take on responsibilities to support their parents and grandparents. Now they expect to be supported well into young adulthood. The ""New breed"", born since the 1960s, have never known anything but richness. Youth are seen as resistant to entering society as mature adults, to becoming social citizens. Once the great objective of reconstruction after the Second World War was accomplished, a new generation lost the motivating power that had untied the nation together. Japan's birth rate has been falling rapidly, partly because of the recession , and the job and financial insecurity that it has caused. In 1999, the figure was 1. 38 children per woman, the lowest ever recorded. At the same time, youth crime, although still especially low by western standards, rose to its highest level since record-keeping began 32 years ago. Likewise, the percentage of students dropping out before graduating, at 2. 5% also very low by western standards, has been rising. Entrepreneurial ( ) role models are few and far between. Bill Gates is often mentioned, but a foreign model can only have so much influence. The problem is that Japanese culture discourages people from revealing details of personal life, including such ordeal as starting a company. In the past, successful companies such as Honda or Hitachiprovided role models of a sort. But today they have been faded by the downturn, and few others have risen to take their place. Young people also quite often feel isolated from their fathers, who worked too hard at their jobs to establish much of a relationship with their children. ""The one thing they're sure of is that they don't want to be like their fathers. And the girls don't want to be with boys who are like their fathers, so the boys are sure not to be,"" says Professor Morishma."	['to work hard and support their family']

"A study of more than five million books indicated a decrease in ""mood words"" over time except _ ."	"A study of more than five million books, both fiction and non-fiction, has found a marked _ in the use of emotional words over time.The researchers form the University of Bristol used Google Ngram Viewer, a facility for finding the frequency of terms in scanned books, to search for more than 600 particular words identified as representing anger, dislike, fear, joy, sadness and surprise. They found that almost all of the categories showed a drop in these ""mood words"" over time.Only in the category of fear was there an increase in usage. ""It is a steady and continuous decrease,"" said Dr Alberto Acerbi.He assumed that the result might be explained by a change in the position occupied by literature, in a crowded media landscape.""One thing could be that in parallel to books the 20th century saw the start of other media.Maybe these media -- movies, radio, drama, had more emotional content than books."" Although both joy and sadness followed the general downwards trend, the research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that they also exhibited another interesting behaviour:the ratio between the two varied greatly, apparently mirroring historical events. During the Roaring Twenties the joy-to-sadness ratio reached a peak that would not occur again until before the recent financial crash.But the ratio plunged at the height of the Second World War.Nevertheless, the researchers held a reserved opinion about their claim that their result reflected wider social trends.In the paper, they even argue that the reverse could be true. ""It has been suggested, for example, that it was the suppression of desire in ordinary Elizabethan English life that increased demand for writing 'filled with romance and sex'... perhaps,"" they conclude, ""songs and books may not reflect the real population any more than catwalk models reflect the average body."""

The moment the author found the car missing, he thought _ .	One day I walked down to get to my car, thinking about what I had to accomplish and scolding myself for being late for work, but surprisingly the car was nowhere to be found. This was at 8 a.m. in the morning. I made trips to all the towing places and police stations, all the time thinking that it was towed by cops .By around 10 a.m., the cops decided that it was actually stolen. After filing a report with them, I finally got to work thinking how my day was completely messed up. Later in the day I went to pick up a rental car at Enterprise only to realize that my license was missing, too, along with my car. I told the enterprise guy the whole story and he offered to take me to the closest DMV and get a duplicate license. 1 was totally shocked. I did not know why this complete stranger would want to take some time off his day to help me. He actually took me to DMV, got a duplicate and then rented me a car. I was upset the whole day because of the events happening to me but somehow this simple act of kindness from a complete stranger made it all worth it. It cheered me up and made me forget all the troubles of the day. I was so moved by this kind act that the next day I made sure someone else got a similar surprise. I took some smiley shaped chocolates and left them on some of my colleagues' desks. There is still a lot of goodness out there in the world. We just need to take the time to notice it. I hope that this story would inspire many others like me to do more acts of kindness.	['it was towed by the police']
Most animals move from one place to another at a certain time to _ .	"We know that many animals do not stay in one place.Birds,fish and other animals move from one place to another at a certain time.They move for different reasons:most of them move to find food more easily,but others move to get away from places that are too crowded. When cold weather comes,many birds move to warmer places to find food.Some fishes give birth in warm water and move to cold water to feed.The most famous migration is probably the migration of fish,which is called ""Salmon"".This fish is born in fresh water but it travels many miles to salt water.There it spends its life.When it is old,it returns to its birthplace in fresh water.Then it gives birth and dies there.In northern Europe,there is a kind of mouse.They leave their mountain homes when they become too crowded.They move down to the low land.Sometimes they move all the way to the seaside,and many of them are killed when they fall into the sea. Recently,scientists have studied the migration of a kind of lobster .Every year,when the season of bad weather arrives,the lobsters get into a long time and start to walk across the floor of the ocean.Nobody knows why they do this,and nobody knows where they go. So,sometimes we know why humans and animals move from one place to another,but at other times we don't.Maybe living things just like to travel."	['find food more easily']
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Most children, even the youngest of children, are delighted to be around cats and dogs. But these pets carry plenty of germs and allergens , prompting researchers to ask: Are cats and dogs really safe for children? A study finds that, contrary to many parents' fears, owning cats or dogs does not increase a child's risk of developing allergies, and in fact, may actually protect them. The study's lead author, Dr. Dennic Ownby of the Medical College of Georgia, says that even he was ""very surprised"" by the results. Ownby and colleagues followed more than 470 children from birth to age 6 or 7, comparing those exposed to cats and dogs during their first year of life to those who were not. By using skin-prick tests for detecting common allergies, the researchers found that, contrary to what many doctors had been taught for years, children who had lived with a pet were not at greater risk. Even more remarkable, children who had two or more dogs or cats had an even greater reduction, up to 77 percent, in risk of allergies. Researchers suggest this protective effect may be the result of early exposure to lots of bacteria that are carried by dogs and cats. Exposing young children to these bacteria helps"" exercise"" their immune systems early in life so that they're better able to resist allergic diseases later. There's something very important in that first year of life when the immune system is developing that we can retrain _ away from an allergic response, said Dr. William Davis. And while researchers are not encouraging parents to buy dogs or cats just to reduce a child's allergy risk, they say if a family already has one or more animals, there's no need to get rid of them."

According to the text, among 500 disengaged employees, how many would probably have the intention of leaving their company?	"SAN FRANCISCO--Only 21 percent of workers worldwide are ""engaged""--that's the word used to describe workers who are ready to expend some extra effort at work--while 38 percent are disengaged, according to a new survey. ""Engagement is not satisfaction or happiness, but the degree to which workers connect to the company emotionally, and the degree to which workers are aware of what they need to do to add value and are willing to take that action,"" said Julie Gebauer, a managing director of Towers Perrin, a consulting firm, which surveyed almost 90,000 workers in 19 countries. ""Happy employees don't necessarily create better financial results, but there is a definite link between engagement and a company's financial performance,"" Gebauer said. The survey found 21 percent of workers worldwide are engaged, and another 41 percent are ""enrolled"", which means they're on the road to engagement. More than 80 percent of the engaged employees say they contribute to the quality of company products, services and customer satisfaction, while only 40 percent of disengaged workers agree. Engagement helps retention too. About 50 percent of engaged employees say they have no plans to leave their company versus 15 percent of the disengaged. ""The fact that almost 80 percent of workers are disengaged is likely costing companies money."" Gebauer said. ""The conception of engagement is really a financial issue,"" said Gebauer. 'Organizations that have employees that are highly engaged deliver better financial results than those that don't."" In a separate study, Towers Perrin assessed data on 40 global companies over a three-year period, measuring employee engagement at a certain point and then looking at the companies' financial results over the following three years. Companies with highly motivated workers enjoyed a 3.7 percent increase in profits, while companies with a lower level of worker commitment saw a decrease in profits slightly. What makes for an engaged employee? It's not necessarily pay. While the level of pay is important, it's not among the top 10 drivers of engagement. Rather than only using the pay, companies should survey their work force, much as they might study their customers, to assess what employees are seeking."	['425.']
What happened to the author at the age of twelve?	Unlike many surfers who sought the perfect wave, my interests always lay beneath the sea' s surface in a world I could only imagine and dream of.When I was twelve, I made my first adventures in the deep.Later I would learn how to dive, expanding my world of exploration many times over. Perhaps the greatest turning point in my life came when I was in high school and I wrote a letter to the famous Scripps Oceanographic Institution, asking how I might learn more about the sea.A kind scientist answered my letter and told me how to apply to Scripps for a summer scholarship, which I received.During one of their courses that summer, I met Dr.Robert Norris, a marine geologist.He loved the sea almost as much as I did.Soon he suggested I consider his school, the University of California, for my study.One year later I became a member of the freshman class. Now my love affair with the sea became a serious endeavor .If I wanted to be an undersea explorer, I needed to learn as much as I could about the laws of the physical world that controlled the environment I wanted to enter.The undersea world is not our natural world.It is unforgiving to those who make mistakes.At its greatest depths the water temperature is near freezing, the pressure is eight tons per square inch, and it is totally dark.It is easy to get lost in such a world.I needed to learn a lot about geography, navigation, geology, biology, and many other things. I decided another important thing for me to do was to join the U.S.Navy.If I was going to be an undersea explorer, I would have to lead men and women on dangerous adventures where they might get hurt, and I didn't want that to happen. In the Navy I learned discipline, organization, and how to motivate and lead people on adventures so that we could explore the wonders of the deep. Finally, the time came to put all that I had learned to use, to go forth with a team of men and women and explore an adventure I am still on and hope to be on for many years to come.

How do computers write fictions?	Now net fiction ,also called computer fiction is popular in more than 80 countries. To write computer fictions,the writers don't have to think about making any plot.Like reporters,they just go to a lot of places and collect materials:what most women want,their ideas about life and love,their happiness and sufferings and emotions.All these materials are fed into the computer to be processed and classified .Then the writers just pick some materials from every part and fill in some details and a story is made up. The first computer fiction was edited by 13 editors and published in Canada in 1976.It was a great success and 45 million copies were sold.Seeing this new process as profittaking a big American publishing company bought over the majority of the 13 Canadian editors and soon a series of computer fictions were published in the United States. All the computer fictions have very romantic titles.The heroine is always about 20,while the hero is a 30 to 40 bachelor ,handsome,with money and power.The hero and the heroine have a happy reunion after all kinds of misunderstandings .Computer fictions are enjoyed by most women readers of the west.But people doubt if they have any literary value .

What's the best title for this passage?	First aid is the aid or the help which can be given to an injured person first, that is, before any other help comes. Nowadays there is usually a telephone not far away and the first we should do, if a serious accident happens, call the phone for an ambulance. Sometimes our quick action may save someone's life. Shock. People often suffer from shock after receiving an injury, sometimes even when the injury is very tiny. The face turns grey, and the skin becomes damp and cold. They breathe quickly. They should be kept warm. Cover them with a blanket and give them a warm drink. Broken bones. Do not move the patient. Send for an ambulance at once. Bleeding. A little bleeding doesn't harm. It washes dirt from the wound. But if the bleeding continues, try to stop it by placing a clean cloth firmly over the wound until the bleeding stops or helps arrive. Poison. A person who has taken poison should be taken to a hospital at once. With some poisons, sleeping pills, for example, it is a good thing to make the patient throw up by pressing your fingers down his throat. Remember: When an accident happens, send someone to telephone for an ambulance at once. Keep the injured person warm and quiet. Give him plenty of air. Do not let other people crowd around him.

"The song ""Old MacDonald"" describes"	"Walking in a farmers' market often brings one to explore new food options, and now more locally-farmed protein choices are available to help bridge the gap between our meals and the farms from which they originated. More and more local small farms are popping up in opposition to factory farms. Today's commercial farms do not fit the image that comes to mind while happily singing along to ""Old MacDonald"". Instead, most of the nation's food comes from CAFOs, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, where animals are kept in tightly enclosed conditions as they are fattened up and readied to be killed for food. Fortunately, knowing exactly where one's food comes from has led to an increase in the availability of what is known as ""grass-fed"" beef. Technically, all cattle are grass-fed for at least a limited amount of time, but what makes the meat significant is that it is grass-finished, not force-fed corn, soy or grains. This change in diet makes all the difference since corn is not part of the cow's traditional diet, and therefore causes major health issues for it. To deal with the health issues, antibiotics are used and some of the antibiotics used to treat the cattle are similar to those given to humans, so they can decrease the effectiveness of medicine when a consumer is sick. A healthier diet for the cattle leads the meat to lower in both fat and calories. And when cooking grass-fed beef, you'd better use a slightly lower temperature to make it more delicious."

German universities are popular among US students mainly because .	Studying abroad will shape you in various ways. You will learn things you never would have if you study overseas. But college is expensive in the United States. It's cheap or free in other countries even for foreigners, so why not get out of here and come back smarter?

Living costs are about $7,000 a year, which is even lower than in other European countries and a great appeal to many students wanting to studying abroad. Besides, Germany encourages international students. They create a multicultural landscape that benefits German students as well. According to a new report, Germany is home to six of the world's 100 best universities. These schools offer around 900 degrees completely in English and many German students speak the language. You could be part of Finland's excellent education system. The Finns charge no tuition and offer a number of courses purely in English. They would be happy for you to add flavor to their school scene. Cost of living there is high. Be prepared for frosty winters, but you will get that sweet midnight sun in the summer. Many other European nations provide cheap or free college for foreign students, but if South America is more your thing, try Brazil. Most of the education will take place in Portuguese, so if that is in your plan you can study near beautiful beaches and jungles. The University of Sao Paulo and State University of Campinas are both highly ranked internationally. Your money will go a long way there, too. Living on the economy in a foreign country will keep you on your toes. You will learn new customs, how to bargain, stay safe, budget and become more flexible with people.

"By saying ""You had better take two bullets with you if you want to do that"", the captain actually meant to say _ ."	"Mr. Frank shot well and once he had come in fourth in a competition. Then he went to a big city on business. There he joined the local rifle club. The club had a very good team, which used to take part in a lot of important shooting competitions. One of these took place while Frank was with them. But one of the members of the club's team suddenly fell ill just before the match. The captain had heard of Mr. Frank. He therefore invited Mr. Frank to take the sick man's place. Mr. Frank felt greatly happy to be asked to shoot for such a good team, but he also felt very nervous, because he was afraid of making a fool of himself. In fact, he was so nervous that he could not keep his hands from trembling while he was shooting, with the result that he did very badly in the competition. When he took his score card to his captain, he said:"" After seeing my score, I want to go outside and shoot myself. "" The captain looked at the card for a few seconds and then said, ""Well, you'd better take two bullets with you if you want to do that.

Some English people can't give up fast food because _ .	A large number of people in the world eat fast food .Whenever you go into a fast food restaurant , you can see lots of people enjoying their meals there. How do you know in which country people like fast food best ?

What's the writer's name?	"Ever since I was a child, my mouth has caused me trouble. I'm not a bad person; I have a hard time learning when to keep my mouth closed. My mom has told me again and again, ""Robert, your constant bad words are hurting me. If you continue to be this rude, you will get into big trouble.""It's been a problem at school several times too when teachers have told me something I didn't want to hear. I used to feel it was my duty to stand up for myself. One day in English class I began working on my homework until I heard a classmate talking behind me. It was Nathaniel, talking to himself as usual. I said ever so nicely, ""Nathaniel, would you be quiet?"" Nathaniel continued talking to himself. I quickly shouted ""Nathaniel, shut up!"" For the next five minutes, we threw hurtful words back and forth at each other. ""At least I don't have an ugly lazy eye like you!"" I shouted.I knew this would upset him deep inside. It would hurt his feelings and shut him up. What I said filled him with anger. He tried to reach over my seat and grab me as he shouted, ""That's it! That's it!"" Surprised at his reaction, I sat back in my seat. Never had I seen Nathaniel act like this before. Later on, we were taken to the principal's office. There, Mr. Black, the principal, told us to discuss the matter. It wasn't until then that I finally found that when I hurt someone physically, the wounds eventually heal. But when I hurt them with my words, sometimes the pain never goes away. At the end of the discussion, I said sorry to Nathaniel. When I headed back to my room, I spent some time praying. I began to think about how often what I said hurt others. But I believe that as I keep praying and asking God to help me, he'll tell me when to keep my mouth closed."	['Robert.']
What is the best title for text?	If you hear the sound of a handset beeping in a bag or pocket, you could be forgiven for thinking that someone has received a text message. But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. WhatsApp in America and Europe, WeChat in China and Kakao Talk in South Korea are but a few which have attracted hundreds of millions of people, who use the apps to chat to their friends in real time. These apps allow people to send picture messages for free--something which previously was quite costly. Research company Informa said that almost 19 billion messages were sent per day using chat apps in 2012, compared with 17. 6 billion SMS texts. And it expects the chat app market to grow t0 50 billion per day by 2014. So does this really mean the end for communication by text? Pamela Clark--Dickson from Informa doesn't think so. She says that there are a large number of people who use normal mobile phones, particularly in developing countries, who prefer the SMS messaging tool. There is an awfully big base of mobile phone users who are still going to find that SMS is the best messaging experience for them for a while. ,.	['the death of text messaging']
Which of the following is TRUE about carbon trading platforms?	"BEIJING--As China scrambles to respond to the choking smog that has _ Beijing in recent weeks, authorities in several major cities are experimenting with carbon trading platforms. The schemes are one effort to get control over greenhouse gases in an economy still hungry for cheap energy. It has been a persistent concern in recent years, but the spiking pollution levels in January are sparking a public outcry. Emissions from coal-fired electricity plants and busy factories are part of the problem that officials hope to get control over through carbon trading platforms. Seven cities are expected to open carbon markets later this year, including Tianjin. ""The government has decided to start with programs because the carbon trading is something new to China,"" said David Tang, secretary of the board of the Tianjin Carbon Exchange. ""So we want to have a number of programs to explore the use of the market."" said Tang. China wants to launch a national carbon trading program by 2016. If it is successful, analysts say, the program would be one of the largest in the world and would help the country meet its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent within seven years. The platforms allow companies to earn credits for lowering greenhouse gas emissions, which can then be traded. If it works, it would encourage for-profit businesses to invest in green technology. As public concern builds pressure for the government to find a solution, Wu Changhua, greater China director of the Climate Group, says there is a broad shift under way in how Chinese weigh their quality of life. China has long put economic growth ahead of environmental concerns, making it the world's biggest polluter. Carbon trading supporters hope that the markets could be one way to curb pollution and keep the economy growing."	['The choking smog may promote their development.']
What's the passage mainly about?	"Phone Soap: Charge and Clean Your Phone You may charge your phone every day, but do you clean your phone as much? Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli. The research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges. ""There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,"" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. ""He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,"" said Barnes. ""In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines."" Phone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, ""The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully."" The co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up. Both co-founders have left their previous jobs and are selling Phone Soap nonstop. ""We're shipping almost more than we can handle each day,"" Barnes says. ""It's been a great adventure."""	['A phone charger keeping your phone clean.']
What can we learn from the text?	"When Nancy Lublin received $5,000 from her grandfather, she never once considered taking a vacation or paying off student loans .Instead, the 24-year-old New York University law student began thinking about helping low-income women get better jobs. ""If a woman goes for a job interview poorly dressed, she won't get the job, ""Lublin says.""But without a job, she can't afford suitable clothes."" So, with the money Lublin founded ""Dress for Success' and began collecting women's clothes which were still in good condition but which their owners no longer needed."" So many women have clothes lying around that they will never wear again,"" one of Lublin's assistants says, ""Nancy's idea is so simple and yet so important to women."" Many women come to Lublin's office before going to a job interview. Here, they receive a suit, shoes and any other things they need, Since it was set up, more than 1,000 women have turned to ""Dress for Success"" for help. Many of them have won job. Some have round jobs after being out of work for many years.

Which of the following is Not true according to the passage?	"Every year in late April, students at Renmin University of China become the subjects of admiration and jealousy of their peers on other campuses in Beijing. Why? Because they get a week off in the middle of term, the so-called spring break. "" _ 's been a unique tradition of our school for a decade,"" said Wang Yueran, 20, a journalism major at Renmin University, who organized a weeklong trip to Sichuan with 12 classmates last year. But having fun is just one dimension of the spring break. Field trips, voluntary work, and social projects are all on students' to-do lists. Experts say the spring break is not just for students to enjoy a few days off, but for them to gain new experiences beyond the campus walls. Push them out The traditional Chinese belief of the exploration of knowledge and truth emphasizes ""reading 10,000 books and traveling 10,000 miles"", which indicates the importance of experience as much as theory. But while Chinese universities have the tradition of spring outings, what's the benefit of making spring break an institution? Qin Jianguo, of the student affairs office at Shenzhen University, thinks the idea of the spring break in some universities in China comes from the intention of pushing students out of the ivory tower to experience more diversity in their lives. ""Take traveling for example. A week traveling is a very different experience to a one- or two-day outing,"" said Qin. ""Students are expected to acquire the spirit of teamwork and compromise, and learn survival and communication skills when put out there in an unfamiliar context."" Diverse approaches Many countries have similar vacations in the middle of the semester for students to do things out of their own interest. Taking Japan as an example, instead of partying like their US counterparts, many Japanese students choose to work as interns or engage in study-related projects. ""The spring break is an opportunity for many of our students to put their learning to use,"" said Hiroshi Kanno, dean of the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy at Hitotsubashi University, in the school's description of a recent spring break project. As for Chinese students who take a week off around the Labor Day holiday, many tend to do volunteer work. Duan Zhipeng, a 22-year-old economics major at Renmin University, applied for a project to go back to his hometown in Jiangxi province to introduce his university's enrollment policies and campus culture to local high school students. Not a trend yet Apart from Renmin University, only a few other universities, such as Yantai University, have a spring break for their students. The concept in China is still far from the culture and norms built around it in the US. Wei Xiang, a professor specializing in holiday economics at Beijing International Studies University, said that the spring break is a good experiment for universities to make study schedules smoother in order to give students more options to arrange their own leisure and study activities."

The manager of the drugstore shouted at the writer in dirty words because _ .	"There was one shop in the town of Mufulira which was widely known for its racial discrimination. It was a drugstore .While Europeans were served at the counter ,a long line of Africans queued at the window and often not only were kept waiting but were treated rudely by the shop assistants .One day I was determined to make a public protest against this kind of thing ,and many of the schoolboys in my class followed me to the store. I simply went into the shop and asked the manager politely for some medicine. As soon as he saw me standing in the place where only European customers were allowed to stand ,he shouted at me in a bastard language which is only used by a boss when speaking to his servants .I stood at the counter and politely requested in proper English that I should be served .The manager became angry and said , ""Even if you stand till Christmas ,I will never serve you ."" I went to the District Commissioner's office .Fortunately ,he was out ,for _ however ,I saw a young District Officer who was a friend of mine .He was very concerned to hear my story and told me that all I had to do was come to him personally and he would buy my medicine for me .I protested that that was not good enough .I asked him to accompany me back to the store and to make a protest to the manager .This he did ,and I well remember him saying to the manager , ""Here is Mr. Kaunda who is a responsible member of the Urban Advisory Council, and you treat him like a common servant ."" The manager of the drugstore apologized and said , ""If only he had introduced himself and explained who he was ,then ,of course ,I should have given him proper service."" I had to explain once again that he had missed my point .Why should I have to introduce myself every time I went into a store...any more than I should have to buy my medicine by going to a European friend ? I want to prove that any man of any color ,whatever his position ,should have the right to go into any shop and buy what he wanted .After all, the money which I paid across the counter was exactly the same money as was paid by a European customer."

What is the main idea of the passage?	"Most Chinese people don't understand why some westerners don't eat meat. In China, to eat meat is a sign of wealth. If a westerner doesn't take a bite of their Peking duck, there is something wrong. But many people in Europe and America choose not to eat meat or fish -- they are known as vegetarians. In the US alone there are 12 million vegetarians and 19,000 more people stop eating meat every week. People often become vegetarians in order to lose weight or eat more healthily. A lot of research has shown that vegetarian diets are healthier than the average western diet. Fried chicken may be delicious to eat, but all that extra fat can damage your heart. There are many other reasons for ""turning veggie"". It could be that you cannot afford to buy meat. Or maybe you just don't like the taste of it. A large number of vegetarians choose to give up meat because they believe it is cruel to kill animals for food. They believe many animals are not allowed to live in comfort and, when they are killed, it is carried out in a very painful way. While some vegetarians are happy not to eat animals, others take it one step further and refuse to eat any animal product. They are known as vegans and will not eat cheese, yoghurt and eggs, or drink milk. Neither will they wear clothes or shoes made from animal skin, such as leather. They say that if it is wrong to kill an animal for food, it is worse to kill it for clothing. But there are some groups that go even further. Fruitarians believe it is wrong to kill any living plant or animal. Besides refusing to eat meat, they will only eat fruit and vegetables that have not been killed when harvested. This means they cannot take an apple from a tree: they must wait until the apple falls to the ground. Only then can it be considered dead."	['Meat and health']
According to Dr Katzmarzyk, if you are sitting all the time, you may _ .	"Sitting for more than three hours a day can decrease a person's life expectancy by two years, even if her or she is physically active and gets rid of dangerous habit like smoking ,according to a study. Watching TV for more than two hours a day can worsen that problem, decreasing life expectancy by another 1.4 years. The analysis comes just two years after Australian researchers found that people who said they watched TV for more than four hours a day were 46% more likely to die of any cause than people who said they spent less than two hours a day watching TV. Those watching TV more than four hours a day were also 80% more likely to die of cardiovascular disease. ""Long-sitting behavior is something we need to take note of beyond telling people to get 30 minutes of activity a day ,"" said Peter T. Katzmarzyk, one of the lead researchers. But while the evidence of illnesses is increasing, it remains difficult for many people to find time to get on their feet, especially if they do desk jobs. ""Try to stand as much as you can,"" Dr Katzmarzyk said. ""Typically when you are on the telephone you can stand and use the speakerphone. Instead of e-mailing someone in the office, just get up and so to talk to them."" However , Dr Katzmarzyk added, standing shouldn't be alternative to exercising, but an alternative to sitting . ""Several studies show that when you're sitting , your leg muscles are completely inactive,"" he said . ""When you're sitting and completely inactive, this is when you run into trouble managing blood sugar."""	['find it hard to keep your blood sugar proper']
In the teacher's opinion, Edison _ .	"One day Thomas Alva Edison was given a letter by his teacher. His teacher asked him to give it to his mother. Edison thought it was something nice. After he returned home, he proudly gave it to his mother, saying ""My teacher let me give this letter to you."" Not knowing what it was, Edison's mother opened it, and then her eyes opened wide. With tears in her eyes, she looked at her son and read out the letter aloud, ""Your child is a genius. This school is too small for him and doesn't have enough good teachers to train him. Please teach him yourself."" The fact was that Edison liked asking strange questions in class. His teachers thought he was mentally ill. They could no longer stand him and decided to stop him from going to school. However, Edison's mother didn't give up on her son. She taught him at home. Many years after Edison's mother died and he was already one of the greatest inventors, one day he was looking through the old family things. Suddenly he saw a piece of folded paper in the corner of a drawer. He took it and opened it up. It read, ""Your son is addled (mentally ill). We won't let him come to school any more."" Edison cried for hours and then he wrote in his diary, ""Thomas Alva Edison was an addled child, but, by his hero mother, he becomes the genius of the century."" Having faith in those we love is very important. We should have faith in those around us. Even if others have given upon you, you should have faith in yourself."	"[""wasn't a normal child""]"
Customers are advised to choose bags _ .	"To help the environment, many Americans have made the change from paper and plastic bags to reusable grocery bags. But a report by a Florida newspaper says that reusable grocery bags sold by some supermarkets contain high levels of lead . Lead is a metal that can be harmful to humans, especially young children. Now, Senator Charles Schumer is asking the US government to investigate the use of lead in reusable shopping bags. ""When our families go to the grocery store looking for safe and healthy foods to feed their kids, the last thing they should have to worry about is poisonous bags."" Schumer said, ""A quick investigation will allow everyone to make informed, timely decisions."" Schumer added. Lead in the bags is not likely to rub off on food. But over time, paint on the bags can chip and the bags can wear out. When this happens, lead can be released . The Tampa Tribune newspaper said certain bags sold at Publix and Winn-Dixie supermarkets had lead levels that were a concern to health officials. The affected bags were found in Florida. But Publix has more than 1,000 stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Sough Carolina and Tennessee. Publix says that all of its bags are under current laws about lead content, but that they have asked the makers of the bags to reduce the lead levels in the product. The bags with the highest levels of lead had fancy designs and many pictures. Plain reusable bags without decoration were found to contain little lead. Consumers worried about lead levels in reusable bags can change to cloth or string bags. Paper bags are also a good choice, since paper can be recycled . Since 2007, Publix supermarkets have sold more than 13 million reusable bags. The store says because shoppers have made the change to reusable bags, it has saved more than 1 billion paper and plastics bags."	['made of paper']
In the 1960s, long hair represented _ .	"I learned a long time ago that hair has meanings--plenty of meanings. Growing up in the 1960s, my friends and I struggled without parents' control over the length and style of our hair. At the time, hair represented our need to break free from adults in our lives. Long hair represented our freed inner selves. My clients are often surprised when I asked them questions about their hairstyle--why they choose it, how else they've worn their hair, how they feel about it, and so on. However, while it may seem to be a simple topic, even today our hairstyles still have many psychological and emotional meanings. Understanding some of those meanings can lead to understanding of many different aspects of a person's mind. How we view our hair, for example, can show something about how we view ourselves. Our hair can show physical and emotional wellbeing, desirability, and even social and financial status. When it becomes dull or fragile, it can communicate emotional and physical diseases. But hair can also show unrecognized and often unspoken daydreams about oneself and one's world. One woman--a successful professional--wore her long hair in a thick bun . But one day she showed me that tangled hair was kept in the bun. She said that she never brushed out the tangles because the hair showed her secret image of herself as a helpless, disturbed woman, like Ophelia in the play Hamlet. Another woman came to therapy in a huge shirt and huge pants that she believed they could hide the weight she had put on since the birth of her child. She talked about how much she hated her body and how helpless she felt about doing anything about it. But her hair was always beautifully coloured and decorated. When I pointed out that she seemed to have a different relationship with her hair from she did with her body, she said that her hair had been thinning and that she was trying to make it look as good as she could. I pointed out that what she was doing with her hair and her body was kind of contradictory, and wondered if she had any thoughts about that. She was surprised. But as we talked about her contradictory attitudes towards different parts of her physical self, we began to open up all sorts of other thoughts and ideas about her inner self. And interestingly, as we continued opening those internal doors, changes started to happen. She started eating differently and exercising regularly. One day some months later, she appeared in my office in skinny jeans and a tight sweater, and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail. ""I decided to see what would happen if I stopped trying to hide myself, "" she said with a big smile. ""And...? "" I asked. ""People keep smiling at me in the street. My husband hugged me this morning for the first time in ages. And I feel good! "" Besides, selfrespect in both men and women can be damaged by thinning hair;they may feel alone even though they are really not. Given our cultural focus on physical appearance, youth, and health, hair loss can be unpleasant for both men and women. The market is filled with hairenhancing treatments, but there are those who have decided to be against the system and change to the ""bald is beautiful"" position. But it is much harder for women to take the ""bald is beautiful"" approach to hair loss. We tend to try to hide it in one way or another. But no matter what approach you use, it is important to remember that the thickness of your hair has nothing to do with your value in the world. Remember that you have nothing to be ashamed of if you have thinning hair. Thinning hair may not be something you can change, but it doesn't have to control how you represent the person who lives underneath it."	['freedom']

It said, ""My name is Frank, and I'm five years old.My dad and I are travelling on a ship to Denmark.If you find this letter, please write back to me, and I will write back to you."" The letter, dated 1987, included an address in the town of Coesfeld. The boy in the letter, Frank Uesbeck, is now 29.His parents still live at the letter's address. The Russian boy and the German man met each other earlier this month through an Internet video link.The Russian boy said he did not believe that the bottle actually spent 24 years in the sea.He believed it had been hidden under the sand where he found it for a long time. Uesbeck was especially happy that he was able to have a positive effect on a life of a young person far away from Germany.""It's really a wonderful story, "" he said.""And who knows? Perhaps one day we will actually be able to arrange a meeting in person."""	['Because he could have a positive influence on a life of a young person.']

If you want to succeed, you'd better learn _ .	Students learn their lessons in class. In class teachers teach them. Students sit in the classroom listening to the teacher. This is a way of learning. Is this the only way for students to learn something? Of course not. There is another way to learn: students can teach themselves. For example, if you can't remember something when you are doing your homework, you can look at your book to find the answer. This is a way to teach yourself. And it is not a difficult thing. We can do this at any place and at any time. How do you teach yourself? The first thing you must do is reading. Read something you are interested in. or you have to read. The second is that you must ask yourself questions. The question is something you don't understand, or you want to know more about. You can write down these questions. A clever student is usually good at asking questions. The third is to answer the question yourself by thinking hard, by reading the passage or other books, and sometimes by asking other people. This is the way of teaching yourself. And you must do this all by yourself. If you keep doing like for a long time, you are sure to succeed in your study.	['how to teach yourself']

The purpose of the first sentence of the passage is to _ .	"Would you jump off the Great Wall of China for 300 pounds a day? A stunt person is a man or woman who does all the dangerous bits of acting work in films or on TV. This can be anything from a simple fall into a swimming pool, or walking off the top of a tall building. It sounds like a job that you would have to be made to try, but there are actually lots of people who want to do it. Sarah France, twenty-four, is one of Britain's sixteen professional stunt women ---there are one hundred and sixty stunt men in the country. We asked Sarah how she came to be a stunt woman. ""When I was young I was trained to be a dancer, and for seven years after school I was hardly out of work. A dancer's life is pretty short, though, and my father suggested I should think about doing stunt work after I'd given up dancing. I thought about it for the next two years and decided to have a go. For six months, I worked really hard every day. I had to learn different skills---swimming, jumping, horse -riding, etc."" Sarah finished the course in just five months and applied to the office which decides whether you're accepted as a professional stunt person or not. Two weeks after she was accepted, Sarah was throwing off the Great Wall of China in Superman IV. ""I was very lucky to get work so quickly. I had a small part, playing a traveler who fell off the Wall after an earthquake. The traveler's life was saved by Superman, of course! Actually, I fell forty-five feet into a pile of cardboard boxes! You can't use anything softer than that or you will be brought back into view of the cinema. Instead you just have to learn to fall properly. It's quite dangerous but I enjoy it."""	"[""draw the readers' attention to the whole passage""]"
Where were the writer and her husband when she lost her wallet?	"My life plan is to visit all the states in the US. Several years ago, my husband and I were traveling in the northwest. One day, when we were having our breakfast, I lost my wallet that had over $300 in it. There was no way for us to be able to find it, but we went on with our trip. We went off to drive around and enjoy the city, completely forgetting my missing wallet. Later on, when I checked my phone, there was a message from the boss of the restaurant where we had our breakfast: ""I have something that belongs to you, and you're going to be very happy."" We got back to the restaurant and there was the wallet on the table with all the money in it! The boss's son found the wallet in front of the door, and brought it to him. He thought that it must belong to someone who had a meal in the restaurant, so he checked inside and found my phone number on a piece of paper."	['They were in the northwest of the US.']
"""One's physical assets and liabilities don' t count all that much in a managerial career.""(paral) can be interpretated as _ ."	A few common misconceptions. Beauty is only skin-deep. One' s physical assets and liabilities don' t count all that much in a managerial career. A woman should always try to look her best. Over the last 30 years, social scientists have conducted more than 1,000 studies of how we react to beautiful and not- so-beautiful people. The virtually unanimous conclusion: Looks do matter, more than most of us realize. The data suggest, for example, the physically attractive individuals are more likely to be treated well by their parents, sought out as friends, and pursued romantically. With the possible exception of women seeking managerial jobs they are also more likely to be hired, paid well, and promoted. Un-American, you say, unfair and extremely unbelievable? Once again, the scientists have caught us mouthing pieties while acting just the contrary. Their typical experiment works something like this. They give each member of a group--college students, perhaps, or teachers or corporate personnel managers a piece of paper relating an individual' s accomplishments. Attached to the paper is a photograph. While the papers all say exactly the same thing the pictures are different. Some show a strikingly attractive person, some an average-looking character, and some an unusually unattractive human being. Group members are asked to rate the individual on certain attributes, anything from personal warmth to the likelihood that he or she will be promoted. Almost invariably, the better looking the person in the picture, the higher the person is rated. In the phrase, borrowed from Sappho, that the social scientists use to sum up the common perception, what is beautiful is good. In business, however, good looks cut both ways for women, and deeper than for men. A Utah State University professor, who is an authority on the subject, explains: In terms of their careers, the impact of physical attractiveness on males is only modest. But its potential impact on females can be tremendous, making it easier, for example, for the more attractive to get jobs where they are in the public eye. on another note, though, there is enough literature now for us to conclude that attractive women who aspire to managerial positions do not get on as well as who may be less attractive.	"[""whether or not one looks good or bad, it doesn' t affect much one' s managerial career""]"
Where will most probably a triangle space be formed?	"How to survive an earthquake prefix = st1 /Indonesia is located on the edge of the volcanic ring that circles the Pacific. This means volcanoes and earthquakes, which can cause serious loss of life. Many people there have heard suggestions of what to do in an earthquake. For instance, they are taught to stand in a doorway or, in a building, avoid the elevators and head for the stairs. Mr. Doug Copp is an expert on earthquakes and is the Rescue Chief and Disaster Manager of the American Rescue Team International. He has worked at every major disaster in the world since 1985. What his years of involvement have taught Doug is that when roofs and ceilings collapse they fall on objects and furniture, crushing them. Anyone hiding under a desk or a bed is always killed. However, Doug says the falling roofs and ceilings always end up forming triangle of space between the crushed object and the floor, what he refers to as Triangles Of Life. Instead of hiding under a solid object, lie on the floor next to it and you will likely have a space to survive. Doug says paper does not crush and usually where there are boxes of paper in an office building there will be a triangle space next to it. What about the old idea of standing in a doorway because the roof falls into the room? Dough says people who stand in doorways are usually killed, too. If the door falls forwards or backwards you will get crushed by the falling ceiling. If it falls sideways you will get cut in half by the doorway. What about stairs? Stairs have a different ""moment of frequency "" to the rest of the building and will swing back and forth until they collapse. Getting caught on a destroyed set of stairs means you will probably be injured or even killed by the different parts."	['Next to a desk.']
Which of the following is a true statement according to the passage?	"Gray hair is simply a part of the normal aging process, and the rate you go silver is genetically predetermined. Going gray is not associated with earlier death, and premature graying is not, generally speaking, a sign of an illness or ill health in younger adults. There are, however, some specific health conditions associated with gray or white hair, but for most of us, going gray is just a fact of life. Hair color1 comes from the pigment melanin , which determines your individual shade. Hair without any melanin is pure white. The pigment is produced in cells called melanocytes, which inject pigment into the hair. At some point in everyone's lifetime, these cells slow down and eventually stop producing color1. Scientists have yet to identify the exact mechanism by which melanocyte cell death occurs. A study of more than 4,000 women and men from 20 countries determined that about 75% of people between the ages of 45 and 65 have some gray hair. In general, people of European descent gray earliest followed by Asians and Africans. It's interesting to note that a lucky 1 in 10 has no gray hair by retirement age. Beginning at age 30, your chances of having gray hair go up 10-20% per decade. It may feel like you have more grays after a stressful event, but that's probably because middle age is basically a series of anxiety-ridden events. Between working, raising kids, and caring for older parents, the ""sandwich"" years of 45-65 can be stressful, especially for women. They are also when we naturally start to look older. At this point, there is still no silver bullet to keep away the grays."	['Europeans are more likely to gray than Asians and Africans.']

What is the passage mainly about?	In late summer or early fall the large, yellow seed heads of sunflowers will be ripening. If gardeners can keep off the birds and other wildlife trying to eat the seeds, they can have a large harvest. The bright yellow blooms will make a rainbow garden, brightening up any space. However, planting the sunflower seeds is a skilled job. Plant seeds no deeper than the full length of itself. Smaller sized sunflowers can be spaced a foot apart. Larger varieties will need to be spaced as far apart as three feet. This allows ripe plants enough space for the seed heads to ripen without knocking the ripe seeds off before gardeners have a chance to harvest them. Most sunflower seeds, especially those with eatable seeds, are large enough to handle without the need for seed sorters. This is why sunflowers make an excellent choice for a children's garden as well. Gardeners will want to mix plenty of soil fertilizers into the ground as sunflowers tend to be heavy feeders. Sunflowers can be slow starters and the tiny new plants don't seem to grow very rapidly. Gardeners should protect the new plants as they begin to grow. Once they get going, sunflowers are able to _ many weeds, making them easier to grow in the home vegetable garden than many other plants. Most pests and diseases are not a bother to the sunflower, however, more than one gardener has said that their lovely looking plants were destroyed overnight by hungry squirrels, mice or birds. To preserve their harvest, gardeners can cover the ripening seed head with stockings or net cloth to help keep the destroyers off the seeds. Planting sunflower seeds is easy and can help even the smallest gardener feel successful in their gardening attempts.	['How to plant sunflowers.']
It is a must that a Disaster Master knows _ .	"You can't hide a natural disaster from children, so how do we prepare them for it? First of all, you should explain to them that acts of nature aren't necessarily disasters but can become one. These may include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, winter storms, wild fires, and earthquakes. The way to prepare children for these disasters is to educate them about what each type is and then make it fun by making them ""Disaster Masters"" or whatever title you can think of. Making them a Disaster Master won't be easy. They must know what's in a disaster emergency kit and why it's included. You can get your friends involved, too. If your friends have children, they may want to be involved in your emergency preparations. Make it a group project. This is the opportunity for everyone to become familiar with the equipment. We have to be aware of our conduct and the way we react to stress. The children will be easily influenced by your attitude and _ . The calmness, steady manner, and good humor of your spouse and you will go a long way toward the easing or the reduction of stress. Explain to them what they're likely to encounter or see and describe how people may react. Disasters can come and go very quickly and generally don't last long. If you must stay away from home, try to get into a routine quickly and encourage them to make new friends. Let them know they can look to their parents and other adults if they become scared or confused. And it's important to let them know it's OK to cry during a disaster. It's sometimes helpful to let the children draw pictures of what they've experienced. Encourage them to write what they learned and what could have been done better. Save the story. Make it part of a documented family history!"	['how to use a disaster emergency kit']
What would be the best title for the passage?	"It was my first day of high school, and I was late. My next class, Spanish, scared me. I just could not speak that language. As the bell rang, I ran to the classroom. At the door, a hand reached out and shook mine firmly. I looked up. A man with large glasses smiled. He introduced himself as Profe, which means teacher in Spanish. Right away, his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears. That year, I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish. I admit I only speak a little Spanish. But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe. Every day Profe stood outside his classroom before and after class to give his ""hand hug"". After school his room was always filled with students and he would talk to and chat with them--even those not in his class. He taught me that every person is worth your time. One time, I was rejected by my friends, Profe told me, ""Linda, life gives you ashes. But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels."" Therefore, I learned to look at my troubles differently and not to fear any difficulty. In my senior year, I became president of one of the school's clubs, so I was very busy. Many times I didn't even have time to buy lunch. He served me by giving me his food as well as advice. He lived out what he taught us to do: serve others. The author William Arther Ward wrote: ""The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires."" Thank you , Profe, for inspiring me."

Which title best gives the main idea of the passage?	The first newspaper were handwritten sheets which were posted in pubic places. The earliest recorded newspaper was started in Rom in 59 BC. In the 700's the world's first printed newspaper was developed in China. The paper was printed from carved wooden blocks and sent out among the citizens. Europe didn't have a regularly published newspaper until 1609, when one was started in Germany. The fist regularly published newspaper in the English language was printed in 1620. In 1621, an English newspaper was started in London and was published weekly. The first daily English newspaper was the Daily Courant, which didn't appear until March 1702. In 1690, Benjamin Harris printed the first American newspaper in Boston. But the local government soon stopped its publication. In 1704, John Campbell started The Boston News-letter, the first newspaper to be published daily in America. By 1760, the whole America had more than thirty daily newspapers. There are now about 1800 daily papers in the United States. Today, as a group, English language newspapers have the largest circulation in the world. The largest circulation for a newspaper, however, is that of the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, which sells over eleven million copies every day.	['History of Newspaper.']
San Franciscoprovides bicycles to the public because _ .	"prefix = st1 /San Francisco is going to do what many other cities have already done --- provide free bicycles to the public. The mayor of San Franciscosupports the bicycle program. He wants to improve the terrible traffic problems in the city. At first, 40 to 60 bikes will be available only to city workers. People will give their old bikes to the city to use in the program. If this program is successful, one day more than 1000 bicycles will be available. Everyone, not just city workers, will be able to use these bicycles. People in Fresno,Californiaalready have a free bicycle program. In fact, this idea began inAmsterdamover 40 years ago. These programs encourage citizens to get out of their cars and onto pollution-free bikes. Fresno's Yellow Bike Program puts about fast bicycles around the city. The bikes are painted bright yellow so people know they can take them. When people take a yellow bike, they can ride to work or to shopping areas, and then leave the bike for the next rider. Some people worry that the free bikes will be stolen. However, theft hasn't been a problem in other free-bike cities.

The example of wine is used to illustrate that _ .	The traditional distinction between products that satisfy needs and those satisfy wants is no longer adequate to describe classes of products. In today's prosperous societies, the distinction has become unclear because so many wants have been turned into needs.A writer, for instance, can work with paper and pencils. These are legal needs for the task.But the work can be done more quickly and efficiently with a word processor. Thus a computer is soon viewed as a need rather than a want. In the field of marketing, consumer goods are classed according to the way in which they are purchased.The two main classes are convenience goods and shopping goods.Two lesser types are specialty goods and unsought goods. It must be emphasized that all of these types are based on the way shoppers think about products, not on the nature of the products themselves. What is regarded as a convenience item in France(wine,for example)should be a specialty goods in the United States. People do not spend a great deal of time shopping for such convenience items as groceries, newspapers, toothpaste, aspirin, and candy. The buying of convenience goods may be done routinely, as some families buy groceries once a week. Such regularly purchased items are called staples. Sometimes convenience products are bought without enough thinking; someone has a sudden desire for an ice cream sundae on a hot day. Or they may be purchased as emergency items. Shopping goods are items for which customers search. They compare prices. quality, and styles, and may visit a number of stores before making a decision.Buying an automobile is often done this way. Shopping goods fail into two classes:those that are recognized as basically the same and those that are regarded as different. Items that are looked upon as basically the same include such things as home appliances, television sets, and automobiles.Having decided on the model desired, the customer is primarily interested in getting the item at the most favorable price. Items regarded as essentially different include clothing, furniture, and dishes. Quality, style and fashion will either take precedence over price, or they win not matter at all.

What's the writer's purpose of writing this passage?	"Most nutrition education isn't very effective. People know that an apple is better than a Snickers bar, but they often eat the Snickers bar anyway. After conducting hundreds of studies on the psychology of how and why we eat, I've seen that it's good to understand nutrition, but it's much better to change your eating environment. Doing so can help you make better choices without even thinking about it. Part 1 We all know children can be stubbornly habitual in what they want to eat. If kids had French fries yesterday, they want them again today. We came up with a simple way to interrupt this default. Instead of asking kids what they want, what if we ask them about someone they admire? We studied this with elementary school-aged children one summer. We treated 22 kids to apple slices or fries at a fast-food restaurant. The first week, 20 of them ordered French fries, and two ordered apple slices. But the next week, we asked, ""What would Batman eat: apple slices or French fries?"" After they answered for Batman, we asked them what they wanted. This time, the number of kids who ordered apple slices jumped from two to ten-- almost half of them. If you ask yourself before deciding between the salad and the cheesy bacon fries, ""What would my role model choose?"" you'll be a lot less tempted. Thinking about what a well-liked person would do makes us _ . Part 2 If we knew what a skinny person's kitchen looked like, we could set up our own kitchens in a similar way. Once we got into people's homes, we took pictures of everything: their dishes, sinks, refrigerator shelves, counters, snacks, pet-food dishes, tables, lighting -- even random items held up by magnets on their refrigerators. Then we spent eight months coding these kitchens to see what thin people do differently. We wondered if big kitchens turn us into big people. But it turns out that kitchen size isn't the problem. It's what you see in the kitchen. The average woman who kept potato chips on the counter weighed eight pounds more than her neighbor who didn't. ""In sight, in stomach.""

There's also a greater possibility of things getting lost in translation over social media. ""If half of your relationship is over social media, you don't really know how the other person is reacting,"" Sienna Schulte, a junior student from Illinois, said. Yet, some people believe social media has made it easier to start relationships with anyone from anywhere. Beth Kaplan from Illinois met her long-distance friend through social media. He currently lives in Scotland, but they're still able to frequently communicate with one another. ""I can feel close to someone that I'm talking to via FaceTime,"" Kaplan said.

The authors attitude towards Ashoka's program can be described as _	"You may not have heard of Ashoka, but for the past 27 years,this association, founded by Bill Drayton, has fought poverty and sickness, promoted education and encouraged small businesses. To support these worthy causes, Ashoka provides money for the world's most promising ""changemakers"" seeking to solve urgent problems and would like to create a world in which every citizen is a changemaker. Drayton believes that anyone can become an agent for change. The important thing is to simply give yourself permission. If you see a problem that you care about, you can help solve it. The young in particular are willing to accept this concept because at heart every child wants to grow into a happy, healthy, contributing adult. In fact It is many young people's ambition to set up programmes or businesses that improve social conditions. An excellent example is an Ashoka project started in 1995 in Dhaka, which handled the rubbish problem facing the city ,helped local farmers and provided an income for poor people there .

What impressed the US team players most?	"A couple of years ago, before a trip to China, Nicole Davis and her US women's volleyball teammates were warned about the prominence (, ) of coach ""Jenny"" Lang Ping in her native country. ""I was pushed over by Chinese journalists while I was just trying to put my luggage on the bus,"" said Davis. Known as the ""Iron Hammer"" for her punishing spikes , Lang made it possible for China to dominate in the sport in the early 1980s. She was a key player on China's 1984 Olympic gold medal winning team. When the US team arrived for the Olympics, Lang, 48, who is from Beijing, had to take a different route to avoid a crowd of reporters and fans. Then came the greatest moment to Lang:while the US team was playing in a packed gym, at least 8,000 Chinese fans _ an American flag. ""That really says it all,"" Davis said. ""They look at her as an icon .I'm sure it's hard for them to see her coaching another country, but they love her so deeply that her success is their success."" The loyalty of the Chinese fans was tested on Friday, when China lost a match to the US. ""It's a pity that China lost the match, but I'm still glad that Lang Ping's team won, since she is the pride of China's volleyball,"" said Liu Chengli, a spectator. ""We also cheered for Lang's victory."" Lang said she just tried to stay professional when the two teams meet. ""It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team. It's the same."" Lang said. Davis said she and her teammates could not have imagined the passion for volleyball among Chinese because the sport was lack of popularity in the US. The reception from Chinese fans has touched the US players, said a US volleyball player Lindsey Berg. ""It's such an honor to be here and play for our coach here in China,"" she said. ""The amount of support that the Chinese give to her and us has been tremendous. The whole event has been unbelievable."""	['The popularity of volleyball in China.']
The people in the church but Grandpa felt confused at what the director said because _ .	"Grandpa Nybakken loved life -- especially when he could play a trick on somebody. At those times, his large Norwegian frame shook with laughter while he pretended innocent surprise, exclaiming, ""Oh, forevermore!"" But on a cold Saturday in downtown Chicago, Grandpa felt that God played a trick on him, and grandpa wasn't laughing. Grandpa worked as a carpenter. On this particular day, he was building some boxes for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage abroad. On his way home, he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses, but they were gone. He remembered putting them there that morning, so he drove back to the church. His search proved fruitless. Suddenly, he realized what had happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket unnoticed and fallen into one of the boxes, which he had nailed shut. His brand new glasses were heading for China! The Great Depression was at its height, and Grandpa had six children. He had spent twenty dollars for those glasses that very morning. ""It's not fair,"" he told God as he drove home in frustration. ""I've been very faithful in giving of my time and money to your work, and now this."" Several months later, the director of the orphanage was on vacation in the United States.He wanted to visit all the churches that supported him, so he came to speak on Sunday night at my grandfather's small church in Chicago. Grandpa and his family sat in their usual seats among the small congregation . ""But most of all,"" he said, ""I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year."" ""Even if I had the money, there was simply no way of replacing those glasses.Along with not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day, so my co-workers and I were much in prayer about this. Then your boxes arrived.When my staff removed the covers, they found a pair of glasses lying on the top."" After a long pause, he continued, ""Folks, when I tried on the glasses, it was as though they had been custom-made just for me! I want to thank you for being a part of that!"" The people listened, happy for the amazing glasses. But the director surely must have confused their church with another, they thought, there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas. But sitting quietly in the back, with tears streaming down his face, an ordinary carpenter realized _ had used him in an extraordinary way."	['the glasses were not included in the donation list']
Bill Gates believes that one important way of developing poor countries is _ .	"Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that he planned to give away almost all of his fortune ,largely to the cause of global health,during the course of his lifetime.With an estimated worth of more than $40 billion,according to Forbes,the project will be no small fate for Gates.Having already provided the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with $24 billion to address global health issues,Gates said that finally his entire fortune will be put towards the cause except ""a few percent left for the kids"". So what has made the richest man in the world to channel his resources so heavily into one interest?Gates believes that ""the equality of opportunity ""in which Americans take such pride needs to extend to other nations around the world. Improving the health of the populations,he says,has proven to be an essential method in helping poor countries to be financially successful.""National borders allow inequalities,""said Gates.""We all need to take a more global view,rather than just saying my country is doing well.We have to step up these health issues,knowing how few resources are going into them."" Gates said that both his parents set up an example for him as a child.His father,William H.Gates,was the head of the local Planned Parenthood,and his mother,Mary,volunteered for the United Way.As he gathered his fortune,Gates knew he would finally want to give back as well,but he didn't expect to devote himself wholeheartedly to one project until he was about 60. However,Gates,47,began to question his ability to wait that long.""It seemed there was a real time urgency,""Gates said.""I started to think how many lives I could save before then."""

The best title for the passage is _ .	A long time before I was born, my grandma and grandpa moved into the house on Beechwood Avenue. They had a young family of 4 little girls. During that time, work was hard to find, so Grandpa did whatever jobs he could. He worked on a farm during the week and at weekends he and Grandpa grew some of their own food in the garden . Everybody worked to keep the garden growing. All summer long, the family ate food from the garden and enjoyed the beautiful flowers. Grandma made jam with strawberry, tomatoes, beans, peppers, pears and peaches. It was good to eat through the long winter. The family grew up, and before too many years had passed, the grandchildren came to visit. Grandma and Grandpa still planted their garden every spring. Everyone still enjoyed the good food from the garden and always took some home. Grandchildren grew up, and grandparents grew older. It became harder for Grandma and Grandpa to keep up the garden. So they made it a little smaller. There was still plenty to eat from the garden and lovely flowers to enjoy. Then one summer when Grandpa was eighty-nine years old, all he could do was to watch from his chair as the vegetables grew and the flowers came out. Summer slowly went away, and Grandpa died before it was time to bring in the harvest .	"[""Grandparents' Garden""]"
The passage is mainly about that _ .	Commencement is a time for idealism. But economic reality is cruel everywhere; especially for new graduate. They have been told repeatedly that a college degree is an open sesame to the global economy. But that's not necessarily so, according to new research by two economists at he Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Frank Levy and Peter Temin. It is true that people with college degrees make more money than people without degrees. The gap has narrowed somewhat in recent years, which is disturbing. But the earning power of college graduates still far outpaces that of less-educated workers. The bad news, though, is that a college degree does not ensure a bigger share of the economics pie for many graduates. In recent decades Mr. Levy and Mr. Temin show, only college-educated women have seen their income grow in line with economy wide gains in productivity. The earnings of male college graduates have failed to keep pace with productivity gains. Instead, a huge share of productivity growth, which expands the nation's income, is going to Americans on the top of the income scale. In 2005, the latest year with available data, the top of 1 percent of Americans---whose average annual income was $ 1.1 million--- took in 21.8 percent of the nation's income, their largest share since 1929. Administration officials, and other politicians and economists, often, believe that income inequality, reflects an education gap. But Mr. Levy and Mr. Temin show that in the case of men, the average bachelor's degree is not enough to catch the rising tide of the global economy. They argue that the real reason that inequality is worsening is the lack of strong policies that broadly distribute economic gains. In the past, for example, a more progressive income tax and unions promote equality. Positive measures have been _ and new ones have not yet emerged, making the income gap even greater. Mr. Levy and Mr. Temin conclude that only a new government policy can restore general prosperity. That's a challenge to the nation's leader and today's graduates. America needs them to contribute to the development of the nation in global economy.	['research shows that American government should take measures to ensure income equality for college graduates']
What can we know from the last sentence of the passage?	"On a hot African morning, Leila was lying on her stomach and an elephant was walking towards her. Leila waited. Then she pushed the button on her camera. ""And I got my best photo of an elephant ever, by lying under my car,"" Leila explained. ""I wanted to get close to the elephants, but of course this was dangerous; they had their babies with them. So every morning I used to park my car in the open near the path . They used to take the same path every morning when they left the water hole. After a week, they were used to seeing my car. So the next morning, I lay under it and got my photo!"" Many of the best wildlife photos come from good planning. In Africa, photographers set up their hides near water holes. They also set up hides near forest paths, as animals use the same paths every night. For bird-watching, many lakes have hides. Inside the hides, bird-watchers can watch all day in the shade out of the wind and rain. Good wildlife photos are needed for books, postcards, magazines and newspapers. But a success rate of 1 in 20 is good."	"[""It's hard to take good wildlife photos.""]"
Why does the author think that people have no excuse for being overweight?	We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do.

If the trap door of a meat-eating plant is closed, the plant is	"If you travel to a new exhibition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers, you will have chances to see some meat-eating plants. Take bladderworts, a kind of such plant, for example. They appear so small and grow in a quiet pond. ""But these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom, able to capture a small insect in 1/50 of a second using a trap door!"" Once the trap door closes on the victim, the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insert. When dinner is over, the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again. Meat-eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn't offer much food nutrition. In such conditions, these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years. North America has more such plants than any other continents. Generally speaking, the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye, like pitcher plants, which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers full of nectar . Hair-like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing can escape, and the digestive enzymes can get to work. A tiny insect can be digested in a few hours, but a fly takes a couple of days. Some of these pitchers are large enough to hold 7.5 liters. Meat-eating plants only eat people in science fiction movies, but sometimes a bird or other small animals will discover that a pitcher plant isn't a good place to get a drink."	['enjoying a dinner']
How do Little Free Libraries get their books?	"The sharing economy has grown in recent years to include everything from apartment sharing to car sharing to community tool sharing. Since 2009, a new form of sharing economy has been emerging in neighborhoods throughout the US and around the world---- Little Free Library. The libraries are boxes placed in neighborhoods from which residents can withdraw and deposit books. Little Free Libraries come in all shapes and sizes. Some libraries also have themes, focusing on books for children, adults, or tour guides. In 2009, Tod Bol built the first Little Free Library as a gift to his mother, who was a devoted reader. When he saw the people of his community gathering around it, exchanging conversation as well as books, he knew he wanted to take his simple idea further. ""I think Little Free Libraries open the door to conversations we want to have with each other,"" Bol said. Since then, his idea has become a movement, spreading from state to state and country to country. According to Little FreeLibrary.org, there are now 18,000 of the little structures around the world, located in each of the 50 US states and 70 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia. The Internet has helped to spread Little Free Libraries. But an Atlantic article says the little structures serve as a cure for a world of e-reader downloads. The little wooden boxes are refreshingly physical and human. For many people, the sense of discovery is Little Free Libraries' main appeal. ""A girl walking home from school might pick up a graphic novel that gets her excited about reading; a man on his way to the bus stop might find a volume of poetry that changes his outlook on life,"" says the Atlantic article. ""Every book is a potential source of inspiration""."	['Citizens shared them.']
The diversities of eggplant reflect in many aspects EXCEPT _ .	"What's delicious, healthy to eat and comes in various colors? Eggplant! And no, it has nothing to do with chickens! This strangely named vegetable is, however, as _ as an egg. It can be steamed, fried or baked. It can be eaten by itself or combined with meats and other vegetables. Eggplant was first grown in India during the 5th century B.C. Its popularity soon spread to China and then throughout Asia. Finally, during the Middle Ages the vegetable made its way to Europe. At that time, eggplant was not the shiny purple vegetable most people know today. Instead, it was like a white egg. Due to this egg-like appearance, eggplant got its name. In its early days, the vegetable was so bitter that people often called it a ""mad apple"". This nickname started because people believed its bitterness was bad for one's health. People actually thought eggplant could cause insanity and cancer. Fortunately, today people know that eggplant doesn't cause insanity or cancer. In fact, eggplant is so healthy that it may prevent cancer. In addition, the brain and the heart benefit from this supper vegetable. Since it is high in fiber, eggplant can also improve digestion. Italy, Turkey, Egypt, China and Japan are the leading growers of eggplant in the world today. Depending on its location, eggplant may be purple, green, orange or yellow-white. And it can be as small as a tomato or as large as a cucumber. Dish diversities range from simple to complex, with all of them being delicious! Today, thousands of people are gathering in Loomis, Calif, for the 23rd annual Loomis Eggplant Festival. The main activity at the festival is eating delicious eggplant dishes. There is plenty more to do and see, though. Recipe contests, arts and crafts, performers, races and children's activities all ""egg-cite"" festival-goers. Most people at the festival would agree -- eggplant is an ""egg-cellent"" vegetable!"	['nutrition']

Which of the following sentences might Hoogewerf agree with?	"Rupert Hoogewerf, whose name sounds Dutch, is actually an Englishman. The 34-year-old man is very famous in prefix = st1 /China--though many Chinese merchant princes have complicated feeling towards him. Every day people, meanwhile, take delight in talking about his work. All of the fuss is over the annual report that Hoogewerf puts out ranking Chinese millionaires. On the wall of Hoogewerf's office in Shanghai, there is a massive Chinese map, and on almost every province is glued a small strip of paper. On each strip is written how many millionaires are registered on Hoogewerf's list. Hoogewerf, wearing jeans and sandals, speaks fluent Chinese to introduce the initial motivation for compiling the list. When Hoogewerf went into university to study Chinese in 1997, he says, he was affiliated with the renowned accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and was assigned to work in Shanghai. Working in Shanghai, he could see first-handChina's fast economic development. ""But my fellows and I don't understand the process of how this could happen,"" he says, ""let alone to explain this phenomenon in the concept of economics."" Then he had an idea to compile a ranked list to introduce Chinese tycoons abroad, knowing that foreigners preferred reading people's stories to data. With the help of two colleagues in 1999, Hoogewerf complied the first ranking of Chinese millionaires. The most difficult task was to select candidates, and Hoogewerf and his colleagues spent two months reading Chinese and English magazines and newspapers. From a list of more than 1,000 people, they chose 300 people to survey and contact further. Finally, a list with the hundred richest businessmen in Chinaappeared. The listing astounded the populace; the Chinese have a tradition where people are afraid to exhibit their wealth. The achievement of a hundred millionaires became the main topic in everyone's conversation. Hoogewerf instantly became famous acrossChina. Hoogewerf also brings forward some advice to Chinese companies. In his opinion, compared to foreign companies, Chinese companies are still in the beginning phase. Their finance management and public relations need most work. So the service in accountant, auditing, public relations, consultation and so on is still required.

The old lady helped the waitress by_.	"He was driving home one evening when he saw an old lady standing by the road. He could tell she needed help. So he stopped his car in front of her car and got out. He smiled at her, but she was worried. Was he going to hurt her? He looked poor and hungry. He said: ""I'm here to help you ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car? By the way ,my name is Joe."" She had a flat tire . Joe crawled under the car and soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. She said that she couldn't thank him enough for his help. Joe just smiled as he closed her trunk . She asked him how much she owed him. But Joe wasn't thinking about the money.

This is an unusual form of transportation, because it is a tunnel that trains travel through and not an actual form of transportation. The Chunnel is actually the English nickname for the Channel Tunnel. In French, it is called le tunnel sous la Manche. It is a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel at the Straits of Dover. It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race whi1e they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about $ 21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel. The two outside ones are the passenger trains. The small inner one is a guidance train. The guidance train is not used for transportation. Each track is exactly parallel to each other. There are four different train systems in the Chunnel. The Eurostar is a high speed passenger service that connects London, Paris, Brussels, and Lille. The Eurotunnel shuttle is a rail ferry service.

The key point of the passage is that _ .	"A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the victory of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people. Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability. Accountability isn't hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences. Of the many values that hold civilization together --- honesty, kindness, and so on --- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law --- and, ultimately, no society. My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people's behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment. Fortunately there are still communities --- smaller towns, usually --- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that declare: ""In this family certain things are not tolerated --- they simply are not done!"" Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you annoy him. The main cause of this breakdown is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it's the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged upbringing, by the school that didn't teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn't provide a stable home. I don't believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything. We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it.."	['more people should accept the value of accountability']
The school new rules will help kids by telling them _ .	New rules and behaviour standards for middle school students came out in March Middle School is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't dye their hair, smoke or drink. The following are some of the new rules. Tell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework. Do more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird-Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it makes it more fun for everyone. Have you ever quarreled with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. Be open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth II someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone. Protect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know. Use the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't for kids, so try to look at Web pages that are good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework.

Which solution to Venice's problem would the author agree with?	"At the entrance to one of the ruined temples of Petra in Jordan, there is an inscription in the soft red rock. It looks as if it has been there for centuries. It could have been carved by one of King Herod's soldiers, when they were imprisoned in the town in 40 BC. But closer examination reveals that it is not so ancient after all. It reads: Shane and Wendy from Sydney were here. April 16th 1996, The ruins of Petra were discovered in 1810 by a Swiss explorer, and a recent report has just concluded that 66they are in grave danger of being destroyed by the unstoppable march of tourism"". More than 4,000 tourists a day pour into Petra's rocky tombs. They wear away the soft red sandstone to powder and (occasionally!) scratch their names into the rock. It is not just Petra that is under threat of destruction. With more than 60,000 visitors to Venice each day, cruise ships that have made Venice tourists' top destination bring one of the most significant dangers to the city, leading to tides that are further damaging the foundation of the Venetian structures. The prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux in France were being slowly ruined by the breath and bacteria from 200,000 visitors a year. The caves have now been closed to the public and a replica has been built, Will there be more replicas like in Lascaux? There already are. Heritage theme parks are springing up everywhere. Many of the great cities of Europe are finding that their historic centers are fast becoming theme parks, filled with clicking cameras and whirring camcorders, abandoned by all local residents except for the souvenir sellers. Until recently, we all believed that travel broadened the mind, but now many believe the exact opposite: ""Modem travel narrows the mind""."	['Reduce the number of cruise ships in the rivers.']
What did President Kennedy do to promote the idea of cleaning up the earth?	Earth Day is celebrated every year on April 22nd.Take some time to find out about how one man,who was determined to change the way we treated our planet,didn't stop until he had made a difference. In 1963,Senator Gaylord Nelson wasn't happy with the earth's condition.He wanted to clean up the planet,solve pollution and environmental problems.A senator is someone US citizens choose to help make laws,so Gaylord had a lot of power.He went to John F.Kennedy,the President at the time,with his ideas.The President agreed that the planet's environment was a serious issue,so President Kennedy went around the country on a five-day tour to promote the idea of cleaning up the planet.People began making small changes but it wasn't enough. A few years later,Senator Nelson decided to put one day aside every year for the cause of saving the planet.On April 22,1970,the first Earth Day was celebrated.More than 20 million people took part in Earth Day activities in 1970.Since then,Earth Day has become an international holiday.People all over the world are doing something to make the earth a cleaner,better place. A rock band named Dramarama wrote a song about Earth Day in 1993 called What Are We Gonna Do.Encouraging your family to recycle on a regular basis is a good way to help the earth.

"When she wrote "" What drove me to live on...I had only experienced a small part of the society "" , she meant that _ ."	"When other nine-year-old kids were playing games, she was working at a petrol station. When other teens were studying or going out, she struggled to find a place to sleep on the street. But she overcame these terrible setbacks to win a highly competitive scholarship and gain entry to Harvard University. And her amazing story has inspired a movie, "" Homeless to Harvard: The Liz Murray Story "" , shown in late April. Liz Murray, a 22-year-old American girl, has been writing a real-life story of willpower and determination. Liz grew up in the shadow of two drug-addicted parents. There was never enough food or warm clothes in the house. Liz was the only member of the family who had a job. Her mother had AIDS and died when Liz was just 15 years old. The effect of that loss became a turning point in her life. Connecting the environment in which she had grown up with how her mother had died, she decided to do something about it. Liz went back to school. She threw herself into her studies, never telling her teachers that she was homeless. At night, she lived on the streets. _ "" she wrote in her book Breaking Night. She admitted that she used envy to drive herself on.

According to the author, what can you do when meeting with a mean old lady?	"1. Mean old ladies There is always a reason why an old lady gives you a serious look - you are being too loud, dressed improperly or not crossing the street in the right place. Sometimes it can be lovely, but if you are already having a bad day, a mean old lady can drive you mad. What to do about it: I've come to realize that when people start conflicts, it is actually an expression of their inner state expressed in an outside way. You, your personality, your looks or your actions have nothing to do with it. It is not personal, so why take it personally? 2. That person, who cuts in front of everybody in line This is something that gets me angry. Even if I am not in a hurry, I still feel bad for the other people in line who are being treated unjustly. Are you more patient than I am or do you feel annoying too? What to do about it: If we have negative thoughts then we are wasting our energy on negativity. Situations like this could be a great opportunity to learn to control our first negative responses and practice understanding. After all, the person may just have a quick question or maybe there is an emergency. Friends that tell you ""I told you so"" It is one thing to admit that you made a mistake and another to hear it from a friend. Friends should be there to support you and cheer you up when you are feeling down, not make themselves feel better at your expense, right? What to do about it: It helps to remember that when people say ""I told you so"", they may mean, ""Please listen to my advice to avoid future mistakes."" If this is not the help you need - voice it out, without getting defensive."	"[""Don't get upset.""]"
The following things will be likely to happen in the hot weather EXCEPT _ .	"It will be hot--hot enough that most locals will have cleared town for cooler places. But because athletes competing at the 2004 Olympics have no choice but to stay in the hot weather, many plan to turn to science to stay cool. Some will put their hands in ice water just before competing and nearly all will be wearing fabrics designed with hot weather in mind. ""Normally we warm up before exercise,""said Gordon Sleivert, director of sports science and medicine at the Canadian Sport Center in Victoria, British Columbia.""But in this case we're taking the warm out of warm up. It's like pre-cooling."" Experts are predicting the average high this August in Athens will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures often reaching above 100(the average temperature in Sydney for the 2000 summer games was 64). Although some events, such as the marathon, will start early(1 a.m.) to avoid hot weather, _ Drinking lots of water will help athletes keep cool, but humidity remains a problem. The body's ability to cool down is weakened by damp air since sweat drips off the skin rather than evaporates ,resulting in dehydration without the cooling. ""Getting hot is a real problem because when our brains heats up, the brain waves are more like when you're really sleepy. Everything feels harder,"" said Sleivert."

Which of the following factors doesn't lead to overweight?	Eat less and exercise more--it has long been a magic word for reducing those extra weight. But now it seems that all the hard work may have been in vain. Scientists say there are ten other reasons why people just keep getting bigger. They say that sleeping habits, central heating, medicines and even some pollutants can play a role in weight gain. Traditionally, people have focused on diet and exercise to solve the problem. However the scientists from top US and Canadian universities say that other things must be considered. Lack of sleep could be partly the reason. In recent years, the average night's sleep has dropped from nine hours to just seven. Sleep shortage changes levels of the hormones that control food intake and body fat and increase hunger and appetite. If it is too hot or too cold, we burn calories to cool down or heat up. But if the temperature is just right, the calories may be turned into body fat instead. Those who take medicine to control their blood pressure can often put on weight. Similarly, studies have shown that going on the Pill can add to a woman's weight. Mother nature may also be the reason, with our body shape being partly inherited . The overweight are also more likely to settle with partners of a similar size. And their children are more likely to be obese . And the use of pollutants is on the rise, say the researchers. The man-made chemicals in pesticides and plastics can lead to weight gain. Your mother's age and your weight at birth are also important, with older woman more likely to have obese children and underweight babies having a bigger chance of being obese in later life. We also tend to put on weight as we get older. Finally, giving up smoking can also help pile on the pounds. The scientists from Yale, Cornell and Johns Hopkins said there was some evidence supporting poor diet and lack of exercise as the main causes of obesity.	['Regular and enough sleep.']
What impresses the town's current-- day authorities most?	"It doesn't look like the heart of a green revolution. The huge chimneys stick up above the line of pine trees and don't make for the most scenic view as you wander around the clear blue waters of the nearby lake. But it is this power plant that has helped the small Swedish city of Vaxjo become arguably the greenest place in Europe. On closer observation, the only thing emerging from the chimneys is the faintest mists of steam. And inside it smells more like a sauna than a furnace . That's because it is not oil fuelling the plant, but woodchip and other wood waste from the area's sawmills. And as well as generating electricity, it also supplies 90 per cent of this southern Swedish town with heating and hot water.[:Zxxk.Com] The gases produced as the wood burns are changed into liquid form, and are purified before they reach the chimney. And instead of wasting this liquid, the power plant pumps it around town. Some runs out of the town's public taps; the rest is directed through pipes that run through individual heaters, warming homes and offices. The pile of wood chippings in the yard towers above head height and takes almost five minutes to walk around. That's enough to keep Vaxjo warm on the snowiest day in winter, or supply it with hot water for a fortnight in summer, and it's good way of using the paper industry's waste. As well as the centuries-- old Swedish policy of planting a new tree for every one felled, the ashes swept out of the furnace each day find their way back to the forest as fertilizer . It was this green plant that netted Vaxjo the European Union's award for sustainable development, making it the greenest city on the continent. However, it is not just the citizen's consciences and moral histories to which the town's current day authorities are appealing. They know how to talk to their wallets too. Oil-generated electricity costs about 16,000 kronor a year(PS1,170) per person, while the new power plant's electricity comes in at two thirds of the price. They've been planning for over ten years to become a ""Fossil Fuel Free City"". But according to Anders Franzen, the head of planning and development department at the city council: ""The battle in the energy sector has been won, yes, but the next battleground is transport."""

Which of the following can be done by Rain Man?	Our brains work in complex and strange ways. There are some people who can calculate the day of the week for any given date in 40,000 years, but who cannot add two plus two. Others can perform complex classical piano pieces after hearing them once, but they cannot read or write. Dr. J. Langdon Down first described this condition in 1887. He called these people idiot savants. An idiot savant is a person who has significant mental injury, such as in autism or retardation. At the same time, the person also exhibits some extraordinary skills, which are unusual for most people. The skills of the savant may vary from being exceptionally gifted in music or in mathematics, or having a photographic memory. One of the first descriptions of a human who could calculate quickly was written in 1789 by Dr. Benjamin Rush, an American doctor. His patient, Thomas Fuller, was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1724. It took Thomas only 90 seconds to work out that a man who has lived 70 years, 17 days, and 12 hours has lived 2,210,500,800 seconds. Despite this ability, he died in 1790 without ever learning to read or write. Another idiot savant slave became famous as a pianist in the 1860s. Blind Tom had a vocabulary of only 100 words, but he played 5,000 musical pieces beautifully. In the excellent movie Rain Man, made in 1988 and available on video cassette, Dustin Hoffman plays an idiot savant who amazes his brother played by Tom Cruise, with his ability to perform complex calculations very rapidly. Today we more clearly recognize that the idiot savant is special because of brain impairment. Yet not all brain injury leads to savant skills. Some studies have shown that people who have purposeful interruption of the left side of the brain can develop idiot savant skills. However few people wish to participate in such experiments. There are many excellent reasons for not undergoing unnecessary experimentation on one's brain. The term idiot savant is outdated and inappropriate. Virtually all savants have a high degree of intelligence and are thus not idiots.	['He can count matches dropped on the floor quickly.']
"The belief that : "" The customer is always right"" suggests that _ ."	"Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right."""	"[""stores should do their best to meet the customer's needs if they want to be successful.""]"
The writer`s father didn`t give the money to the man directly, because _ .	"Once when I was a teenager, my father and I were standing in line to buy tickets for the circus . Finally, there was only one family between the ticket counter and us. This family made a big impression on me. There were eight children, all probably under the age of 12. You could tell they didn't have a lot of money. Their clothes were not expensive, but they were clean. They were excitedly talking about the clowns, elephants, and other acts they would see that night. The father and mother were at the head of the pack, standing proud as they could be. When the ticket lady asked the father how many tickets he wanted, he proudly answered, ""Please let me buy eight children's tickets and two adults tickets, so I can take my family to the circus."" The ticket lady told him the price. The man's wife lowered her head. The father`s lip began to quiver and he leaned a little closer and asked, ""How much did you say?"" The ticket lady again quoted the price. The man didn`t have enough money. How was he supposed to turn and tell his eight kids that he didn`t have enough money to take them to the circus? Seeing what was going on, my dad put his hand in his pocket, pulled out a $20 bill and dropped it on the ground. My father reached down, picked up the bill, tapped the man on the shoulder and said ,""Excuse me, sir. This fell out of your pocket."" The man knew what was going on. He wasn`t begging for a handout but certainly appreciated the help in a heartbreaking and embarrassing situation. He looked straight into my dad`s eyes, took my dad`s hand in both of his, holding the $20 bill, and with a tear running down his cheek, he replied, ""Thank you, sir. This really means a lot to me and my family ."" My father and I went back to our car and drove home. _"	['he didn`t want to let the man feel embarrassed']
Smart home technology can be applied _ in the future.	"In the near future, all housework will be done without having a robot maid. Smart home technology will allow all sorts of electronics and appliances to be able to communicate with each other and perform various tasks. Whenever someone wants to have a snack, but does not feel like making something, why not have the refrigerator suggest something based on what it has inside of it. Not only that, it would communicate with the microwave to prepare the cooking power and time for that particular dish. Nearly all major appliances in the future will take advantage of this technology through home networks and the Internet. Smart home technology is a way for ordinary electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, consumers, and even manufacturers. Many consider a smart home to be one that is networked. Others feel it is a home that has appliances that will allow the consumer to do little or no work, but a smart home really is all of that combined, and more. Not only will all consumer products be networked, but they will also make life easier and more entertaining. Smart home technology is currently being developed and carried out for all rooms in the house, in particular the kitchen and the living room. Many of today's products are becoming ""smart."" Kitchen refrigerators, microwaves, and stoves are using this technology. Even washers and dryers have the technology today to be more automated to fit people's needs. Products in the bathroom will even start to use smart home technology. Electric razors, toilets, and showers will have some sort of automation built in. Smart home technology is still in its early stages but will soon make a great effect on everyone's lives."	['in all rooms in the house']
The children complained about _ besides the weight trouble.	"Mrs. Smith is an unusual teacher. Once she told each student to bring along a few potatoes in plastic bag. On each potato the students had to write a name of a person that they hated And the next day, every child brought some potatoes. Some had two potatoes;some three;some up to five. Mrs. Smith then told the children to carry the bags everywhere they went, even to the toilet, for two weeks. As day after day passed, the children started to complain about the awful smell of the rotten potatoes. Those children who brought five potatoes began to feel the weight trouble of the bags. After two weeks, the children were happy to hear that the game was finally ended. Mrs. Smith asked,""How did you feel while carrying the potatoes for two weeks?"" The children started complaining about the trouble loudly. Then Mrs. Smith told them why she asked them to play the game. She said,""This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The terrible smell of the hatred will pollute your heart and you will carry something unnecessary with you all the time. If you cannot stand the smell of the rotten potatoes for just two weeks, can you imagine how heavy it would be to have the hatred in your heart for your lifetime? So throw away any hatred from your heart, and you'll be really happy. ,."	['the smell']
Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"President Bush this week announced his support for a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.Details published Friday said Israel would remove troops and all settlements from the Gaza Strip by the end of next year.About seven-thousand settlers live there. Israel would also remove four settlements in the West Bank.But six large settlements would remain.The ruling Likud party of Minister Sharon is expected to vote on the proposal on May second. Minister Sharon visited the White House on Wednesday.President Bush praised what he called "" historic and courageous actions."" Mr.Bush said the plan gives the Palestinians, in his words, "" a chance to create a reformed, just and free government."" Palestinian leaders have denounced the president.Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia said Bush is the first president to accept Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories. British Prime Minister Tony Blair was at the White House Friday.He said he welcomed the plan.Blair urged other countries to get involved. At least for now, Israel would continue to control airspace, waters and land passages.Minister Sharon says the plan is necessary because the Palestinian Authority has failed to stop attacks against Israelis.Diplomatic efforts also have not succeeded. A Bush administration official said the president supports the plan because Israel is taking steps to remove existing settlements.Mr.Bush said removing all Jewish settlements in the West Bank would be unrealistic. Palestinian officials called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations, the United States, Russia and the European Union.Palestinian President Yasser Arafat says the plan is hurting Palestinians and they will never stop seeking an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. Israel captured Gaza and the West Bank in the nineteen-sixty-seven Middle East War.It soon began to build settlements.Palestinians want their own state in all of the West Bank and Gaza.They also demand the right of return to lands that are now part of Israel. On Friday, several thousand Palestinians protested against President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon."	['Israel removed troops and all settlements from the Gaza Strip']
According to the writer, _ could be the best way to prevent ourselves from being left out.	In our life, we have rarely expressed our gratitude to the one who'd lived those years with us.In fact, we don't have to wait for anniversaries to thank the ones close to us--the ones so easily overlooked. If I have learned anything about giving thanks, it is this: give it now!While your feeling of appreciation is alive and sincere, act on it. Saying thanks is such an easy way to add to the world's happiness. Saying thanks not only brightens someone else's world, but it also brightens yours. If you're feeling left out, unloved or unappreciated, try reaching out to others. It may be just the medicine you need. Of course, there are times when you can't express gratitude immediately. In that case don't let embarrassment sink you into silence--speak up the first time you have the chance. Once a young minister, Mark Brian, was sent to a remote parish of Kwakiutl Indians in British Columbia. He had been told that the Indians did not have a word for thank you. But Brian soon found that these people had exceptional generosity. Instead of saying thanks, it is their custom to return every favor with a favor of their own, and every kindness with an equal or superior kindness. They do their thanks. I wonder if we had no words in our vocabulary for thank you, would we do a better job of communicating our gratitude? Would we be more responsive, more sensitive and more caring? Thankfulness sets in motion a chain of reaction that transforms people all around us--including ourselves, for no one ever misunderstands the melody of a grateful heart.

The reason why the boy remembers Mr. Young is that _ .	"I remember my math teacher Mr.Young very well. He stood out because the kids made fun of him. He was missing one of his fingers, and always pointed at students with his middle finger. I was not very good at English and math. No matter how hard I tried, I just could not figure out why I did not understand what all the other kids found so easy to learn. One day, I was told that if I got one more E on my report card, I would be taken to the ""big prison for kids"". I tried really hard for weeks. I just couldn't understand how to make different parts of members into whole things. The day before report cards were to come out, I knew that Mr.Young would give me an E, just like he always did. I went to Mr. Young and told him that the orphanage was going to send me to the big prison if I got another E on my report card. He told me there was nothing he could do; it would be unfair to the other kids if he gave me a better grade than I had actually earned. I smiled at him and said, ""Mr.Young, do you know how the kids make fun of you because you're missing your finger?"" He looked at me, moved his mouth to one side and said nothing. ""They shouldn't do that to you because you can't help not having a finger, Mr.Young.Just like I can't help not being able to learn numbers and stuff like that."" I said. The next day, when I got my report card, I tucked it into one of my books. While on the school bus, I opened it: Geography, B+; Mechanical Drawing, C-; English, D-; History, C-; Gym, B+; Art, C; Math, D-. That math grade was the most favorite one I ever received, because I knew that someone in the world finally understood what it was like for me to be missing a finger inside my head."

The Sapporo Snow Festival 2013 will start from _ .	The Sapporo Snow Festival (Sapporo Yuki-matsuri) is a festival being held every year in Sapporo, Japan for over seven days in February. Presently, Odori Park, Susukino, and Tsudome are the main places of the festival. The 2013 Yuki-matsuri dates are February 5 to 11. The festival is one of Japan's largest and most typical winter events. In 2007 (58th Festival), about two million people visited Sapporo to see the hundreds of floating statues and ice sculptures at the Odori Park and Susukino sites, in central Sapporo, and at the Satoland site. The festival is thought to be a chance for promoting international relations. International Snow Sculpture Contest has been held at the Odori Park site since 1974, and 14 teams from various areas of the world participated in 2008. The subject of the statues differs and often shows an event, famous building or person from the previous year. For example, in 2004, there were statues of Hideki Matsui, the famous baseball player who at that time played for the New York Yankees. A number of stages made out of snow are also constructed and some events including musical performances are held. At the Satoland site, visitors can enjoy long snow and ice slides as well as a huge maze made of snow. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of local foods from all over Hokkaido at the Odori Park and Satoland sites, such as fresh seafood, potatoes and corn, and fresh dairy products. Every year the number of Statues displayed is around 400 in total. In 2007, ther were 307 statues created in the Odori Park site, 32 in the Satoland site and 100 in the Susukino site. The best place to view the creations is from the TV Tower at the Odori Park site. Most of the statues are lighted in the evening. The Sapporo Snow Festival Museum is placed in the Hitsujigaoka observation hill in Toyohira-ku, and displays historical materials and media of the festival.	['February 5']
Which of the following statements is TRUE about the red phone box?	"The red phone box in Britain is a perfect example of the British traditional culture. However, with the fast development of mobile phones, it has lost its place in people's everyday life. In order to save their loved red phone boxes, people have come up with many ideas, for example, to turn them into toilets or art houses. In a village in Somerset, a place in South West England, villagers have found a new way to save their red phone box. They turned it into a mini library to deal with the shortage of libraries in their area. The idea was given by a local villager, Janet Fisher, who lives opposite the phone box. Villagers got together to set up the book box. Over 100 books and a lot of movies and music CDs are available at this mini library. The books are of different kinds, including from cooking books to the classics and children's books. People can put the books that they have read inside the phone box, and take away the books that they'd like to read. The books are always changing. There is a regular check on the books to keep the phone box collection fresh. Anyone is free to come to read books there. The phone box library is open every day around the clock and is lit (the past form of ""light"") at night. "" It's very pleasing that the red phone box has been saved. More importantly, it can continue providing a service for us,"" said one of the villagers."	['The library is open to the public day and night.']
"The word ""mateship"" is closest in meaning to _ ."	"Australia is largely a nation of immigration , with one in four of Australia's 21 million population born overseas. But immigrations hoping to become Australian citizens will soon have to take a test examining their knowledge of the country's history and institutions.

Form later this year, new immigrants will have to show an understanding of the English language. They will also be required to answer 20 questions from a list of 200. Anyone who gives fewer than 12 correct responses will not be accepted. Immigrants will also have to accept what the government considers to be 10 important Australia values, including ""mateship"" and ""giving people a fair go"". Other important Australia values are said to include tolerance, compassion, gender equality and freedom of speech. The new citizenship application procedures are detailed in a 40-pages booklet . It describes Australia as ""a nation at ease with the world and itself"" but says that newcomers are expected to respect its values. The booklet sums up mateship as voluntary helping and receiving help from others, especially in difficult times.

To avoid bad luck, the author will probably agree with the statement that _ .	"Your living room Feng shui is all about balance. Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy. Put plants in the corners of the room, as they attract good energy and will energize your health, but not ones with sharp leaves such as yuccas or cactus. Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things. Take a look at every object, and ask yourself, ""Do I really need it? Do I really like it?"" If the answer is no, get rid of it. Your bedroom You should have the head of your bed placed against a wall, as this gives you a sense of security. Avoid having a bed under a window, as you are exposed to danger and bad energy from outside. If this is impossible, use blinds or heavy curtains to cover the window. Never sleep in a place where you can't see the door--you should always be able to see someone who's coming in. Avoid hanging pictures or lights above your bed, as this leads to a subconscious feeling of threat. Don't put mirrors opposite the bed either, as they ""break up"" the image, and therefore the relationship reflected in them. Keep lighting low and soft, and decorate preferably with dark colors. Do not hang paintings of fierce animals, abstract subjects, or water in the bedroom. Water is very good elsewhere, but in the bedroom it suggests financial loss. Make sure you never put plants in the bedroom, and don't have a TV facing the bed, or at least cover it when it is not in use. Your study Don't use the same room for your bedroom and your study, as the different energies will be in conflict. If you have to do this, try to separate the areas either symbolically with plants, or with a screen. Put away piles of files or unfinished work--don't leave them on your desk. Being tidy promotes positive energy. Wherever you study make sure your desk is in the north-east corner, especially if you are preparing for exams, as this area symbolizes education. A bookcase is bad feng shui, as its sharp corners generate negative ""arrows"", and if you have one you ought to put a climbing plant on it to avoid this effect. Cupboards are better than open shelves."	['blinds or heavy curtains can be used to cover the window if your bed is under a window']
What's the best title for the passage?	"Some weightloss camps, which are rare in China just a few years ago,have multiplied in Beijing, Qingdao, Shenzhen,and other cities. Today about 15 percent of adults, or 200 million Chinese, are reportedly overweight.Of these, 90 million--about 7 percent--are obese . Experts say the obesity epidemic is spreading to children, though more slowly than in adults. The obesity, they say, will do harm to the health of China' s citizens and economy.""We're seeing a very large number of teenagers who are quite heavy and aren't moving much,"" said Barry Popkin, a nutrition professor. Popkin carries out an ongoing healthandnutrition survey of 16,000 households in China. He says more kids today are overeating and putting on weight ""quite quickly."" In just ten years China's childhood obesity rate has doubled,with the greatest gains coming in urban areas.""In big cities it's a big problem."" Some experts blame the extra fat on a range of factors, many of them tied to China' s rapidly changing economy and culture. The diets of Chinese adults and children are far higher in meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, fats and sugars than ever before. In addition,kids--especially city dwellers--are more today and spend more time indoors in front of homework, television,computer games, and the Internet. Shuwen Ng,a health economist, says that kids in China now have pocket money, and they spend a portion of it on junk food. Ng adds that advertising and peer groups influence kids' food choices. Certain foods, such as new candies or fast food, have attractive features. China' s childhood obesity rate stillfall behind that of the United States, where some 15 percent of kids are said to be obese. But the longterm effects are equally serious."

What can we do to save water?	"It's time to be water efficient! As populations increase across Australia and the rest of the world, demand for water will also increase. If we don't reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through embodied water) the water situation will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase demands for water much more without detrimental effects to the environment, society and the economy. It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation -""if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target"" - but it's not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of being water efficient. There are many real world examples given in the case studies on this site. Everybody has a responsibility to save water, if future generations are to enjoy a similar standard of living to the one we enjoy now. In fact, many of the impacts associated with water use are likely to have an effect on our own lives! www.savewater.com.au has been designed to help you respond to the challenge to become water efficient. It acts as a central repository for relevant information and further advice, so that you can actually achieve significant savings.

What is the real reason resulting in the old man's mental improvement?	"A girl became a volunteer in the activities of Deathbed Care, which meant visiting and taking care of a patient suffering from an incurable disease with days numbered. The girl was assigned to look after an old man suffering from cancer whose children lived abroad. Their living conditions were not satisfactory while the old man had a lot of savings. She was expected to comfort him and keep up his spirits. Every Saturday the girl came on time to keep him company, telling him stories. When he was having an intravenous drip , she would help massage his arms. The doctor found the patient much improved mentally. The old man began to involve himself actively in the medical treatment and he seldom shouted at others. But something that happened made the doctor uneasy and puzzled. Each time the girl left, the old man would give her some money. The doctor did nothing to interfere , unwilling to offend the old man. A month later the old man showed evident signs of decline after suffering coma a few times. When rescued from the latest coma, the old man told the doctor his last wish, ""I have deep sympathy for the girl. Will you be kind enough to help her finish her studies?"" But the doctor knew that her family was welloff and she had no difficulty pursuing her studies. Sometimes she even came to the hospital in her father's car. When the girl came at the weekend after the death of the old man, the doctor told her the bad news. She was very sad and burst into tears. Then she handed $ 500 to the doctor, saying, ""The old man had all along thought I came to do the job because of poverty. He gave me money so that I could continue my schooling."" Now he got the answer to the puzzle. In the last period of his life, the old man found it a real pleasure to be able to help a girl badly in need."	['The pleasure of helping people in need.']

What can we learn about the woman?	"She was returning from teaching out in a small community . It was a moonless night, and a heavy snow was falling. She remembered back to when she had first started teaching out in small communities. In those days she had always picked up hitchhikers , until the day her sister told her of a friend who had been shot in the head by a hitchhiker, all because she had stopped out of kindness to help him during a storm. Her family didn't become concerned about her safety over the hitchhikers until the family heard the promise: ""No more hitchhikers!"" The snow that night was making her think back to this. Then she saw a man waving. She slowed down for him, but now as he ran toward the car in the dark she shook with fear. Yet she thought that if he was truly in need she couldn't leave him here in this storm. The stranger explained that his car was dead, and she told him to get in. They drove for an hour into the next city and she took him to a telephone booth . She waited until he had made a call. When he reported back to her that a family member would soon come for him, she wished him well and left. _ ""I hope they'll understand why I had to break my promise,"" she thought."

Which of the following can be considered green shopping?	Shopping green can make an important contribution to protecting the planet and conserving its resources. Today's consumer faces a wider range of choices than ever before, Add to that the steady stream of sales campaigns, and shopping smart only gets harder. To buy economically and reduce waste, safeguard health and protect the environment, you'll need to follow some basic principles and have a clear idea of what you want. 1. Do Your Homework Before making any major purchase, take the time to research it. Plentiful resources are usually available online. Avoid buying in a hurry, and don't be persuaded by overenthusiastic salespeople. _ it if necessary--you won't regret giving yourself some extra time to think. 2. Take the Long View Consider the running costs as well as the initial price of any item you buy. Many environmentally friendly products cost more to buy, but save you money in the long run. Choose items that are made to last. For example, pick a sofa that has a hardwood or steel frame rather than one made of softwood, which may break easily. 3. Skip the Disposable Option Buy reusable products like washable cloth towels, handkerchiefs, serviettes and cleaning cloths rather than paper, single-use varieties. Avoid other disposable supplies like cups, glasses, and chopsticks, too. 4. Take the Local Route Buy local products that are in season. It's usually cheaper and fresher and has less harm to the environment. Markets and roadside stands are good sources. Some supermarkets also buy from local producers. Support it if you have one. 5. Avoid Wasteful Packaging Better not buy products that have too much packaging. It's estimated that approximately 10 percent of every shopping bill is actually paying for packaging--which you normally just throw away! Moreover, significant amounts of energy are used in the production of packaging. Purchasing refillable and renewable containers can also help cut this kind of waste.

We can infer from the passage that _ .	In life, people come across many experiences, which they remember throughout their lives. I had a similar experience, too. I was very excited. It was the day of my last paper of the final examination. My mind was full of thoughts of how I would spend my vacation. I was especially excited of the invitation that my uncle had given me to stay with him for a few days in Cambridge. I was prepared for the subject, physics. My friends and I were on the ground doing the last minute revisions and also discussing the questions that were supposed to come in the paper. Suddenly the bell rang and we got into our classrooms. The teacher came and quickly handed out the answer paper and the question paper. The paper was of two hours and some of the expected questions came. I finished it almost forty-five minutes earlier. But since it was a rule not to collect the answer paper before the allotted time. the teacher was not collecting and I had to sit till the time was over. I checked my paper twice and corrected some of the mistakes in it. I started thinking about the place my friends and I had planned to go after the paper. Though I was thinking for a long time, the time seemed to be endless. So I thought of drawing something on the question paper and turned it overleaf. I was shocked to see that the page which I had supposed to be blank had four more questions on it which carried 20 marks and would take at least half an hour to complete. I had a quick glance at my watch. There were only 10 minutes left. I was so nervous that I was hardly in a state to write anything. They were the sub-questions of the last question. Suddenly our physics teacher came in and told all of us that in the last question, out of 6 sub-questions only 2 had to be solved. I felt very much _ . Thereafter I never made such mistakes again. But I realized that my anxiousness and excitement could have cost me to lose 20 marks and decided never to make such a mistake again.	['the writer did 2 sub-questions of the last question']
Though Mo Yan is very successful, _ .	"Chinese writer Mo Yan's Noble Prize for Literature on Thunday might set off an explosion of global interest in Chinese literature and lead to more titles being translated into English. Chinese literature has alyeady attracted international attention, but experts say translation remains a barrier. ""Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already.""says Michel Hockx, professor of University of London. "" It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their work outside China and to interact with readerships abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in Chinese language and Chinese culture."" Hockx adds: ""We need more good translators, especially foreign translators, who know good Chinese and can translate the work into their own languages in a way that foreign readers will appreciate and understand."" London's independent literary agent Toby Eady, who represents many Chinese writers, including Yu Dan, met Mo about 15 years ago in China. But Eady says:""I still think Mo Yan's writing--and, to an extent, all Chinese writing--are not truly understood by Western readers because a part of Chinese literature is lost in translation. The translator has done a good job in translating Mo's work, but the variety of Chinese vocabulary doesn't well translate into English."" University of Oxford lecturer in medern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says:""The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself. People have come to realize that there is a serious knowledge deficit between China and its international counterparts --in particular, China knows incomparably more about Europe and America than the other way around--and reading Chinese literature is an effective means of narrowing that gap."""

"What do we know about the ""Heads-down Tribe""?"	"Today, an increasing number of people are always looking at their mobile phones with their heads down. These people are called the ""Heads-down Tribe"" . Are you a heads-down tribe member? Heads-down tribe members now can be seen everywhere. Using mobile phones may cause accidents and even cost a lot of money. Also, more and more interesting and strange facts happen to the ""Heads-down Tribe"". Let's have a look at an interesting TV report. A man in America kept using his mobile phone on his way home. As a result, he bumped into a big lost bear on the street. When he lifted his eyes from the phone,he was so scared that he turned around and ran away as quickly as possible. Another fact is that we can often see people in the restaurant eating face to face but looking at their own mobile phones. It's strange that they don't talk to the ones who sit opposite to them during the meal. Some of them even have fun communicating with others on the phone. Mobile phones are helpful and necessary tools for modern life. Are mobile phones good or bad? It depends on how people use them. Let's be ""healthy"" users and try to be the ""Heads-up Tribe""."

Where does our self-confidence come from?	Throughout your life, you spend the most time being with or dealing with yourself, but it is exactly yourself that you have the least understanding of. When you are going upwards in life, you tend to think too highly of yourself. When you are going downhill, you tend to have too low an opinion of yourself. It's likely that you think it wise for yourself to know your place and keep yourself from lacking courage to face whatever problem you meet with, in which case your energy and creativity would remain far from enough for your age. To get a thorough understanding of oneself is to gain a correct view of oneself and be a clear-minded realistic person-knowing both one's strength and shortage. You may look forward hopefully to the future but be sure not to expect too much, for dreams can never be fully realized. You may be brave to meet challenges, but it should be clear to you where to direct your efforts. To get a thorough understanding of oneself needs self-appreciation. Whether you hold yourself as a big tree or a thin piece of grass, whether you think you are a high mountain or a small stone, you show a state of nature that has its own reason of existence. If you really admire yourself, you'll have a real sense of self-appreciation which will give you self-confidence. As soon as you gain full confidence in yourself, you'll be enabled to fight and defeat any trouble that will otherwise defeat you. To get a thorough understanding of oneself also requires that you show yourself loving concern about your health and daily life. Unless you know perfectly well when and how to do yourself a favor, you won't be confident and ready enough even to resist the attack of illness. Therefore, just do yourself a favor whenever it's needed. In time of anger, do yourself a favor by giving an exit to it in a quiet place so that you won't be hurt by the anger itself; in time of sadness, do yourself a favor by sharing it with your friends so as to change a sad mood into a cheerful one; in time of tiredness, do yourself a favor by getting a good sleep or some other relaxation. All in all, to get a thorough understanding of oneself is to get a full control one's life. Then one will find one's life full of color1, pleasure and achievement.	['Our self-appreciation.']
The following factors have something to do with disasters behaviors EXCEPT _ .	"Whether it is ""women and children first"" or ""every man for himself"" in a shipwreck may depend on how long it takes the ship to sink, researchers said recently. When the Lusitania was torpedoed by a German ship in 1915, it sank in 18 minutes and the majority of the survivors were young men and women who responded immediately to their powerful survival instincts . But when the Titanic struck an iceberg in 1912, it took ""three hours to go down, allowing time for more civilize behavior to take control--and the majority of the survivors were women, children and people with young children. Economist Benno Torgler of the Queensland University of Technology in Australia and his colleagues studied the two sinkings in order to explore the economic theory that people generally behave in a ""rational"" and selfish manner. The two tragedies provided a ""natural experiment"" for testing the idea, because the passengers on the two ships were quite similar in terms of gender and wealth. The major difference was how long it took the ships to sink. They suggested that when people have little time to react, instincts may rule. When more time is available, social influences play a bigger role. But psychologists noted that many factors other than following social norms could come into play in a disaster, including an evolutionary urge to save the species, attachments that are formed between individuals during the event and the leadership of authority figures. The extent of altruism and how it occurs ""is a very controversial issue,"" said Anthony R. Mawson, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.He thinks the dominant response was attachment behavior. Psychologist Daniel Kruger of the University of Michigan, US thinks that the answer lies less in social norms and more in our evolutionary heritage. Human beings have a deep instinct to preserve our kind, he said, and that means ""people are more likely to save those who have higher reproductive value, namely the young and women in child-bearing years"". Kruger also stressed the importance of leadership during a disaster, noting that the Titanic's captain appeared to have greater control than the Lusitania's."	['social division of labor']

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"You hurry into the kitchen,open the refrigerator and suddenly you forget why you open it.""What am I looking for?""You ask yourself.""What am I doing here?""Don't worry.You are not losing your mind.We have all had this kind of thing.If you think about something very quickly,it goes into your short-term memory and it goes right back out in just a few seconds.You have not moved things from short-term to long-term memory,so you won't be able to remember it later on. What can you do to help get back your missing short-term memory?You may go back to where you were.So,for example,if you were sitting in a chair listening to the music in the living room,just go back into the living room.This will help you remember,and when you are back in the living room,you will suddenly think,""Oh,yes,I was thirsty and I wanted something cold to drink.That is why I went to the fridge.""If,sometimes,you can't go back to where you were before,just try tracing your steps back in your mind.Think back to things you did before,and this may help you."

In order not to get the bad result of imitation, we should	"Blind imitation is destroying yourself. To common people, imitation appears attractive; to creative people ,imitation is misleading. In the early stages of skill or character development, imitation is helpful, When I first learned to cook, I used recipes and really cooked some tasty dishes. But soon I grew bored. Why did I have to follow someone else's way of cooking when I could create my own? Imitating role models is like using training wheels on a child's bicycle. They help you get going, but once you find your own balance, you fly faster and farther without depending on them. In daily life, imitation can hurt us if we hold poor role models. As a child, if you watched people whose lives pain as normal and gone on to follow what they did. If you do not make strong choices for yourself, you'll get the results of the weak choices of others. In the field of entertainment, our culture appreciates famous people. Those stars look great on screen. But when they step off screen, their personal lives may be awful. If you are going to follow someone, concentrate on their talent, not their bad character or behaviors. People like the person who is willing to act on their sudden inspiration to create something particular. Think of the things and people that have affected you most deeply. They moved you because their creations were caused by inspiration, not desperation . The world is changed not by those who do similar work before them but by those who do creative work. Creative people are full of new ideas. The problem a creator faces is not running out of material; It is what to do with the material to knock at the door of imagination. Study your role models, accept the gifts they have given and leave behind what does not serve you. Then you can say, ""If I have announced my success, it's by learning lessons from my ancestors' failure."""	['choose the right example']
The following are all the measures that companies have adopted to cope with the ageing workforce EXCEPT _ .	"Last month the first baby-boomers turned 60. The enormous generation born between 1946 and 1964 is heading towards retirement. The coming ""demographic cliff"" will see vast numbers of skilled workers disappear from the labor force. The workforce is ageing across the rich world. Within the EU the number of workers aged between 50 and 64 will increase by 25% over the next two decades, while those aged 20 -29 will decrease by 20%. Given that most societies have a tendency to retirement at around 65, companies have a problem of knowledge management, of making sure that the boomers do not leave before they have handed over their expertise along with the office keys and their e-mail address. If you look hard enough, you can find companies that have begun to adapt the workplace to older workers. The tools they use to achieve are flexible working, telecommuting, and so forth. Some companies spend ""a lot of time"" on the ergonomics its factories, making jobs there less tiring. Likewise, for more than a decade, prefix = st1 /Toyota, has been unusually keen to employ older workers. IBM uses its alumni network to recruit retired people for particular projects. But such examples are unusual. A survey in America last month by Ernst & Young found that ""although America foresees a significant workforce shortage as boomers retire, it is not dealing with the issue . "" Why are firms not working harder to keep old employees? Mostly they are not hanging on to older workers the only way to cope with a falling supply of labor. The participation of developing countries in the world economy has increased the overall supply--whatever the local effect of demographics in the rich countries."

"Lee Humberg, district manager for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, is the man in charge of figuring out how to remove the flocks of 15,000 to 20,000 Canada geese that could strike planes flying in and out of the New York area. The Port Authority, the agency that manages airport in New York and New Jersey, estimates that there have been as many as 315 bird strikes annually in the past 30 years. Bird strikes have been a hot topic since a US Airways jet suffered a ""double strike"" and made an emergency landing on the Hudson River in January 2009. All 155 passengers were rescued safely and the flight was called ""Miracle on the Hudson"". The plane finally ended up at the Carolinas Aviation Museum. The next major bird strike may not have such a happy ending. To thin the flocks, Humberg and his team have tracked down goose nests and killed eggs with corn oil. They've also terrified the birds with dogs, remote-controlled boats and kites that look like eagles. But the only method that effectively decreases the goose population is the one that angers animal lovers the most: gassing hundreds at a time. ""If all you are doing is goose harassment every day, it's very frustrating, because you are just playing Ping-Pong with the birds,"" Humberg told New York magazine. ""It's basically an arms race to come up with the tools to deal with them."" Now New York City plans to send the geese captured to Pennsylvania to be cooked and distributed at food banks as meals for the poor. That might just be a fate better than flying into a 747 engine."

In both accidents the drivers of the cars _ .	"People enjoy talking about ""firsts"". They like to remember their first love or their first car. But not all firsts are happy ones. One of history's bad but important firsts was the first car accident. Cars were still young when it happened. The accident took place in New York City in May 1896. A man from Massachusetts was visiting the city in his new car. At that time, bicycle riders were still trying to get used to the new set of wheels on the road. No one was sure who was to blame for it. Anyway, the bike and the car hit each other hard. The man on the bike was injured. The driver of the car had to stay in jail and wait for the hospital report on the bicycle rider. Luckily, the rider was not killed. Three years later, another car accident took place. It was again in New York City. A man named Henry Bliss stepped off a streetcar . He was hit by a passing car. Once again, no one was sure just how it happened or whose fault it was. The driver of the car was put in prison. Poor Mr. Bliss became the first person to die in a car accident."	['had to stay in prison for a while']
If a student wants to like school again, what's the first step?	Lots of kids hate school, a new study found. Usually this kind of feeling doesn't last long. School is a fact of life and getting a good education can help you build the kind of future life you want. So let's talk about school and what to do when you don't like it. The first step is to find out why. You might not like school because you don't have enough friends, or maybe you don't get along with your teachers. Sometimes it's a big problem with your classes and school work. You may be getting further and further behind, and it may seem like you'll never catch up. When you know why you don't like school, you can start taking steps to make things better. It's a good idea to talk to someone about your problems with school. Your mom, dad, or teachers will be able to help you. Another good idea is to write down your feelings about school in a notebook. It's a great way to let out emotion . Remember, you don't have to share what you've written with others. And here are some ways to give you the best first day of school. The night before school starts, you can do something quiet and peaceful to calm yourself down, like reading a book with your parents, taking a walk or taking a photo of your smiling face. By doing these, you will have a nice day at school.	['To find out the reasons.']
Kids can avoid web predators successfully by _ .	"Of all the websites, one that has attracted attention recently is myspace.com. Most of this attention has come from the media and tells every reason why the website should be shut down. The danger of internet predators is indeed a tough reality, but shutting down the site is not the answer. If myspace.com were shut down, another site would quickly take its place. Therefore, the right way is to teach teens how to use the site safely and educate them about who may be predators and how to avoid them. The key to staying safe on the Internet is to make sure that your profile is secure. The simplest way is to change the privacy setting on your profile to ""private"", which protects your information so that only the people on your friend list can view it. Although this is effective, it is not perfect. Predators can find ways to view your profile if they really want to, whether through hacking in or figuring out their way onto your friend list. Thus, you should never post too much personal information. Some people actually post their home and school addresses, date of birth, and other personal information, often letting predators know exactly where they will be and when. The safest information is your first name and province. Anything more is basically inviting a predator into your life. Another big problem is photos. I suggest completely skipping photos and never posting a photo of a friend online without asking permission. Most importantly, never, under any circumstances, agree to a real-life meeting with anyone you meet online. No matter how well you think you know this person, there are no guarantees that they have told the truth. But you could feel free to chat with people you meet on the site, but just remember that not everyone is who they say they are. Hopefully, the next time you edit your profile, you'll be more informed about the dangers of Internet predators and take the steps to defend yourself. Lastly, do not send money to anyone you meet online. A common _ among Internet criminals is to request to pay for ""expensive Internet charges"" or ""unreasonable Internet cafe fees"". While it is indeed true that many countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and South America do not yet have Internet service readily available in all cities and towns, a sincere friend from one of these countries will be more than happy to pay their own Internet charges. Never, under any circumstances, should you send money to a stranger from another country(or within your own country for that matter) who claims monetary assistance is required to continue their contact with you."

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"GERALD Christian is in Grade 8 at Ridge Road Middle School in North Carolina, US. She is a member of her school basketball team. Late last month, the 14-year-old faced a big problem. Her mother lost her job. She thought she couldn't pay the $ 50 fee for the city's sports meet this year. Christian was not the only one who had this problem. Some other middle school players in the city had the same problem. That's why famous NBA player Michael Jordan gave $ 250, 000 to the city earlier this month. He wanted to help the poor students. Jordan said: ""I know there are kids who get an education by playing sports. We need to keep sports alive for them."" Christian was _ . ""Really? I can't believe Michael did that for us. These days, I go to bed thinking about it and I wake up thinking about it,"" she said. ""Now the problem is over. "" Christian wanted to say ""thanks"" to Jordan. ""Michael, thank you for giving me the chance to show myself. I will do my best at the meet."	['Few of the players could pay the fee.']
According to the passage, a good lawyer should know how to _ .	The law has a great many rules, showing when and how far a man is to be punished, or if he should be made to hand over money or property to his neighbors, and so on. These rules are contained in books. A lawyer learns them mainly by reading books. He begins by doing little else than reading, and after he has prepared himself by three years' study, still, he has to, almost every day, read more about some new questions which he has to answer. The power to use books, then, is a special skill which a would-be lawyer ought to possess. He ought to have enough flexibility to make it easy for him to collect ideas from printed words. He ought to have some readiness to find what a book contains, and something of an instinct for where to look for what he wants. But although this is the power which he will first feel in need of, it is not the most important. A lawyer does not study law to recite it; he studies it to use it and act upon the rules which he has learned in real life. His business is to try cases in court and to advise people what to do in order to keep out or get out of trouble.	['understand and use what he reads']
What does the author say about energy independence for America?	"People talk about energy everywhere. Green energy, for example. Then, energy independence. It has a nice ring to it. Doesn't it? If you think so, you're not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American president for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession . ""Energy independence"" and its rhetorical companion ""energy security"" are, however, unreliable concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it that we want independence from, exactly? Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere. The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle of biofuel available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction. Second, Americans have basically decided that they don't really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to tolerate the environmental influence of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports? Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don't read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries. There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to keep its economy stable. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices. At the same time, we get massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world."	['It sounds very attractive.']

What is needed to solve these problems?	What are the biggest problems that society will have to deal with in the new age? There are diseases like AIDS and cancer. There's climate change, of course. And what about producing enough cheap food and energy for the world's growing population? Who's going to solve all these terrible problems? Yes, politicians and world leaders will have a big part to play. Yes, businesses will need to create the economic wealth to pay for some of these things. But who's going to make a much greater difference to something like AIDS or climate change? It's going to be a scientist. It is the scientist who can turn some new bit of science into a new technology to solve these problems. If you like thinking about the world around you, why not become a scientist? It doesn't mean you have to wear a white coat and plastic glasses and spend all your time in a lab as most people often imagine! Scientists do all kinds of amazing things that are actually interesting! Military scientists develop not only new weapons but new military technologies that could help make wars out of date. Forensic scientists work with the police to find quite small clues to catch criminals. Scientists work in schools and colleges as the teachers and professors who will train tomorrow's scientists. Don't think a scientist is far away! Maybe you like cooking? You could be a food technologist helping to keep fruit and vegetables fresher for longer. Perhaps sport is your thing? Do you know that most top athletes work with sports scientists in order to improve their performance? You could even be the science writer who gets to spend the life studying the latest advances and sharing them with the world. Looking for something to do for the rest of your life? My advice? Take a long and hard look at science. It is interesting and ever.	['New technologies.']
What is the relationship between obesity and the place where you eat?	"Deborah Cohen is a senior natural scientist at the Rand Corp and the author of the book A Big Fat Crisis: The Hidden Forces Behind the Obesity Epidemic and How We Can End It. According to the book, there are lots of misunderstandings of obesity. 1. If you're obese, blame your genes. Obesity rates have increased. Yet, between 1980 and 2000, the number of Americans who are obese has doubled--too quickly for genetic factors to be responsible. At restaurants, a dollar puts more calories on our plates than ever before, because restaurant meals usually have more calories than what we prepare at home, so people who eat out more frequently have higher rates of obesity than those who eat out less. 2. If you're obese, you lack self-control. Research shows that if we are faced with too much information, we have a tendency to make poor dietary choices. Our world has become so rich in temptation that we can be led to consume too much in ways we can't understand. Even the most vigilant people may not be up to the task of controlling themselves. 3. Lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables is responsible for obesity. Although the US Department of Agriculture estimates that fewer than 5 percent of Americans live in the ""food deserts"", about 65 percent of the nation's population is overweight or obese. For most of us, obesity is not related to access to more fresh fruits and vegetables, but to the choices we make in supermarkets. 4. The problem is not that we eat too much, but that we don't exercise. Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" campaign is based on the idea that if kids exercise more, childhood obesity rates will decrease. But there was no significant decrease in physical activity levels as obesity rates climbed in the 1980s and 1990s. In fact, although a drop in work-related physical activity may account for up to 100 fewer calories burned, leisure physical activity appears to have increased. The problem is that we eat too much."

On the second day of the World Internet Conference themed with cybersecurity and international cooperation held in Wuzhen, an official with China's network emergency watchdog said that 6,118 domestic websites have been controlled by the United States, according to Shanghai Securities News. Among the hacked websites in the first half of this year, 48.8 percent were under the thumb of overseas IP addresses, said Huang Chengqing, director-general of the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team and Coordination Center (CNERT/CC). He added that the US contributed the most, followed by Hong Kong, which controlled 3,097, and South Korea with 2,307. Among the overseas IP addresses inserting backdoor programs in domestic websites, the US accounted for 29.3 percent, South Korea for 6 percent and Hong Kong for 5 percent, he said. In addition, 4.9 percent of government websites have been attacked, and 3.2 percent inserted with backdoor programs. Huang also said that the number of Chinese computers affected by Trojan Horse viruses reached 190,000 in the six-month period. To safeguard cybersecurity, the CNERT/CC has cooperated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and built relationships with 59 countries and 127 organizations. Over the past two years, the center dealt with more than 15,000 cross-border online security cases.	['cybersecurity and international cooperation']
The iPhone 4 drops more bars than normal when tightly held because of _ .	Dear iPhone 4 Users, The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product in Apple's history. It is the best smartphone ever, and most users have told that they love it. So we were surprised when reading reports of reception problems, and we immediately began researching them. To start with, holding tightly almost any mobile phone in certain ways will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars of signal strength. This is true of iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many other phones. But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars when tightly held in a way. This is a far bigger drop than normal, and as a result some have said the iPhone 4 has a faulty antenna design. Upon research, we find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong. Our formula usually mistakenly displays 2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. The big drop in bars is because the high bars were never real in the beginning. We will give a free software update to correct the formula. This software update will also be available for iPhone 3GS. If you are not fully satisfied, you can return your undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple Store within 30 days of buying and get all your money back. Thank you for your patience and support. Apple	['a wrong formula']

What is the author's attitude toward Eco City Farms?	"Eco City Farms are becoming more popular in cities and towns around the United states. Eco City Farms in Edmonton, Maryland, is located near shopping centers, car repair shops and homes. The neighborhood is a working-class community . People do not have very much money. And they have limited access to fresh food in markets. Over the past two years, the farm has attracted volunteers from the community like Marcy Clark. She schools her four children at home. On a recent day she brought them to Eco City Farms for a lesson. Her son Alston Clark thinks his experience is very valuable.""I like coming out here,"" he says,"" You know, you connect with the earth, where your food comes from. You appreciate the food a little bit more."" Margaret Morgan started Eco City Farms. She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives. ""Growing food in a community brings people together,"" she continues, ""Every piece of what we do here is a demonstration to show people everything about how to have an eco-friendly community."" she says. From the Eco City Farms people come to know that they are not only growing food and raising chickens and bees, but improving the soil with compost made from food waste. Eco City Farms is an experimental operation. The farm gets its power not from the local electricity networks, but from the sun with solar panels. In winter, the green house use a geothermal system. Vegetables can be grown all year. So once a week, all winter long, neighbors like Chris Moss and her three children bike to the farm to pick up a share of the harvest.

This passage is mainly about _ .	"After an earthquake or any similar disaster, parents and teachers need to help children overcome the effects of this frightening and sometimes devastating ( ) experience. Psychologists say that if children go through a disturbing event before the age of ten, they are three times as likely to suffer psychological problems as teenagers. After a disaster children may become easily upset, shy, aggressive , or afraid of wind, rain, noises, or darkness. They may have trouble letting go of their parents and resist going to school or daycare. Some children may even feel guilty thinking that they somehow caused the disaster through their bad behavior. Because of such common reactions, parents and others should begin as soon after the event as possible helping these children. Some suggestions include talking to the children about what happened, letting the children express their own feelings, spending extra time with them doing activities together and reassuring them that you love them and won't leave them. For some children expressing themselves through drawing pictures or writing can be useful. Do everything possible to help children get back to a normal routine; however, don't be afraid to ""spoil"" these children for a while after the disaster. Let them have extra privileges and more attention than usual. Encourage the children to grieve after a loss. It should be OK for them to cry. Caring families and friends can do much to heal children victims of disasters."	['how to help traumatized children to get over']
"What should we do before attempting to ""read"" people?"	"Facial expressions carry meaning that is determined by situations and relationships. For example, in American culture the smile is in general an expression of pleasure. Yet it also has other uses. A woman's smile at a police officer does not carry the same meaning as the smile she gives to a young child. A smile may show love or politeness. It can also hide true feelings. It often causes confusion across cultures. For example, many people in Russia smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even improper. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian culture, a smile is frequently used to cover painful feelings. Vietnamese people may tell a sad story but end the story with a smile. Our faces show emotions, but we should not attempt to ""read"" people from another culture as we would ""read"" someone from our own culture. The fact that members of one culture do not express their emotions as openly as do members of another does not mean that they do not experience emotions. Rather, there are cultural differences in the amount of facial expressions permitted. For example, in public and in formal situations many Japanese do not show their emotions as freely as Americans do. When with friends, Japanese and Americans seem to show their emotions similarly. It is difficult to generalize about Americans and facial expressiveness because of personal and cultural differences in the United States. People from certain cultural backgrounds in the United States seem to be more facially expressive than others. The key is to try not to judge people whose ways of showing emotion are different. If we judge according to our own cultural habits, we may make the mistake of ""reading"" the other person incorrectly."	['Understand their cultural backgrounds.']
What can we learn about friends and friendship?	Friendship continues to remain central to our lives. Friends often affect our health and energy. More and more people are increasingly turning towards their friends for support and sharing rather than just communicating with their s. We may have a very unclear understanding of what makes a friend but we all want to have a good number of friends around us. There are certain things you do to help you make friends or at least help you get close to people whom you want to make friends with. The first step to make friends with people is to make them like you. If they don't like you in the first place, it is unlikely that they'll be eager to become your friends. To let someone know that you are interested in him, simple _ s like a little smile and calling him by his name can help. To make the other person feel important, you need to be a good listener and to encourage him to talk. Give your honest and sincere opinion, but do not make fun of him. The second step is to develop trust in each other. You need to share opinions with this person and it is necessary for you to develop a habit of seeing things from his point of view. To become the best of friends, you must show concern and consideration for your friends' desires and opinions. The third and final step is to show your support and encouragement towards your friend. Moreover, you also need to be very clear about your expectations from your friend. If what you expect from the person you want to be a friend matches with what that person can and wants to do in friendship, the developing friendship between you and your friend is sure to be easy and successful.

When Nazi Germany is featured in these films, cruel Nazi officers and brutal concentration camps most often represent it. But the new Hollywood movie Valkyrie tells a different story, ""a chapter of German history which is little known abroad"", according to the German Cultural Minister Bernd Neumann. Valkyrie is based on a true incident that took place in 1944. Colonel Stauffenberg had been a loyal soldier for his entire military career. However, after losing an eye, a hand, and three fingers in an Allied bombing, _ . The destruction that his country had brought to its European neighbors had become too terrible for the colonel to bear in silence. He hoped that someone would find a way to stop Adolf Hitler, one of the most evil tyrants the world has ever known. Realizing that time was running out, he decided that he must take action himself and joined the German resistance. These men drew up Operation Valkyrie, a plot to assassinate Hitler and to overthrow his Nazi government from the inside. This plot is what the film is named after and focuses on. The Hollywood star Tom Cruise plays the lead role. ""This was a very challenging film to make. We carried a huge responsibility to correctly portray history,"" Cruise said.

In class, she asked for a desk that was closer to the blackboard. One day, her teacher said, ""Carmen, I've noticed you squinting a lot. Are you having trouble seeing the board?"" Carmen shook her head. ""I'm fine, Mrs. Cruz."" At home, she had to sit closer and closer to the television. Her mother noticed her squinting as she watched her favorite shows. ""Tomorrow I will go to see a doctor,"" she said firmly. Three days later, Carmen had new glasses. She was told to wear them all the time. ""All of the kids at school will think I am anerd ,"" she said. ""You look just as beautiful with those glasses on as you do without them,"" her mother said. But Carmen didn't believe her. The next day, Carmen kept the glasses in her pocket as she walked into the schoolyard. Suddenly, she heard her friend Theresa shout. ""What's wrong?"" she asked. ""My silver ring is gone!"" Theresa cried. Carmen could tell that Theresa was very upset. They all looked for the ring in the grassy area of the playground. Carmen realized that she could search better if she could see better. She took the glasses out of her pocket and put them on. Everything looked so different! So clear! And aglimmer of silver caught her eye. ""Here it is,"" she shouted. ""Thanks Carmen,"" Theresa said. ""I didn't know you wore glasses. They look great!"" ""Thanks,"" Carmen replied shyly. As they walked back toward the school building, two more girls praised her glasses. Carmen smiled. ""Maybe wearing glasses won't be so bad after all,"" she thought."	"[""things aren't always as bad as we expect""]"

Swept up by mountainous tsunami waves at a Thai resort ( ), she could not hold on to both her young sons and survive . Fighting to stay above the waters , she had to choose which one would have to take his chances in the swirling torrent . ""I knew I had to let go of one of them and I just thought I'd better let go of the one that's the older,"" she told Sky News television in a report broadcast on Thursday. She said she was accompanied by the two boys, Lachie, 5, and two-year-old Blake, and their father, Brad, who had watched the drama helplessly from their first-floor hotel room, when the waves struck. ""And I was screaming, trying to find _ , and we thought he was dead,"" she told reporters on arrival back in Australia. Lachie was found alive about 2 hours later clinging to a door and, looked uninjured as his mother spoke to reporters. British surfer Martin Markwell is also a lucky man. He had always dreamed of catching that perfect wave -but when it finally came along, it was a nightmare. He was on his surfboard when he was swept up by a tsunami wave. ""It was really terrible because I was surfing, I was really surfing on a wave I wasn't supposed to be on,"" he said. ""As an experienced surfer, when I saw the wave come I realized something was wrong, but I couldn't escape because my surfboard was tied to my ankle."" His wife Vicki and son Jake looked on in horror from a hotel balcony as he crashed towards the shore. Luckily , he stayed on top of his board until he reached the hotel , jumped off and got to safety as the ocean rolled back to feed a much larger tsunami wave on its way . The family regrouped and ran to safety just minutes before a giant tsunami wave 10 meters high."	['watched things going on , unable to do anything']
What is the main idea ?	Deserts do not stay the same size .Sometimes they grow bigger. Sometimes they get smaller. The world's biggest desert, Sahara, is in Africa. Right now, the Sahara desert is growing fast. Why is the Sahara growing ? In some places , People farm too much. In other places ,animals eat all the grass. or people cut down the trees. This makes the soil weak. Weak soil lets the desert grow. Why is it a problem? people can not grow food in the desert. people can not build houses, hospitals , or schools in the desert . so people must leave their homes .They must live somewhere else. What can people do ? They can plant trees. They can also farm less. These things make soil stronger. maybe the Sahara will stop growing . It's a big problem. Many people must work together to solve it?	['Planting trees will help the world.']

How can an inventor invent things? The most important thing is how to:	Many people go to school for a good education. They learn languages, history, maths and other lessons. School education is very important and useful. Yet no one can learn everything from school. No matter how much a teacher knows, he cannot teach his students everything they want to know. His work is to show his students how to learn. He teaches them how to read and how to think. So, much more is to be learned outside school by the students themselves. It is always more important to know how to study by oneself. It is quite easy to learn something in a language or a formula in maths,but it is difficult to use a formula in finding the answer to a maths problem . Great inventors do not get everything from school but they can invent many things and change the world a lot. Though Thomas Edison invented many things he didn't have much school education. How do they do all these? Because they know how to study. A lot of things are not taught in the classroom. They get knowledge from books outside school. They work hard all their lives, and the most important thing is that they know how to use their head.	['study by himself']
From the passage, we can see that the living statues perform in the street in order to_.	"In a living statue, just as the name implies, somebody transforms himself or herself into a statue. Last year, I came across an article in a magazine describing living statues in the streets of some Australian cities. The article was vividly written, except that there was not even a single picture; one could only imagine what a scene it would have been! All the harder, then, to believe that I ran into the ""wonder"" in prefix = st1 /Barcelonathis year. The performers - the living statues - were street artists at Las Ramblas. Las Ramblas is the most famous street in Barcelona. Especially in summer, thousands of tourists go to the seaside by passing through this street, making it a center of shops and bazaars. Not only can you find tourists there, but also thieves, cheats, cops...among whom the living statue artists are the most special group. They were covered with greasepaint in different color1s, wearing season - disproportional clothes, standing on a pedestal for several hours without making even a single move. Are they real or _ , the guests were wondering...and then suddenly the statues came to life, just for a few seconds to shift positions. But the movement of the statues seemed like someone just had breathed life into them. They really do look like statues, and that's how they got their name. Usually there is a jar or a hat in front of them. They would change to another pose whenever some tourist puts a coin in the hat. You may take photos after giving a Euro, or even less, but be careful not to touch the statues, unless you want yourself to be covered in paint. It's a really special experience, don't you think?"

Which of the following statements is NOT true about the book My Life?	"CHICAGO --Bill Clinton's eagerly awaited memoir , My Life, will be published this June, and is sure to ignite a firestorm of interest in an already politically charged election year. Bill Clinton said that most presidential memoirs are thought to be ""dull and self-serving, but I hope mine is interesting and self-serving."" My Life, which is being published by Knopf and will sell for $ 35, is expected by many industry watchers to rise to the top of the best-seller lists. Clinton said the book tells the story of his life from his birth and childhood in Arkansas to his years in the White House. From the book readers can have a look at his successes and _ . He tells the story ""as it happens to me, so you see what it's like to be president ... to see how everything happens at once."" Without offering specifics or mentioning Monica Lewinsky, Clinton said, ""I don't spare myself"" in the book. ""I have no idea if this is a great book,"" he said, ""but it's a pretty good story. "" Clinton was reportedly paid an advance of $10 million for the book, which was supposed to be done a year ago. ""The minute that book goes on sale, people will be lined up buying the book,"" said Bob Wietrak, a vice-president and chief merchant for Barnes & Noble. Some predict the 957-page book will be one of the few presidential memoirs to fly off shelves. Booksellers have already taken pre-orders. The 1.5 million-copy first printing is bigger than the first run for Hillary Clinton's memoir Living History, which sold 1.8 million copies."	['It will be published by Barnes & Noble']
We can infer that the person who donate the ears is _ .	"""Can I see my baby?"" the happy new mother asked. When the bundle was in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she gasped. The doctor turned quickly and looked out of the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears. Time proved that the baby' s hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was imperfect. When he rushed home from school one day and threw himself into his mother's arms, she sighed , knowing that his life was to be unfortunate. He cried to his mum ""A boy, a big boy... called me a freak ."" He grew up, handsome. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. ""But you might communicate with other young people,"" his mother blamed him, but felt a kindness in her heart. Two years went by. One day, his father said to the son, ""You' re going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it' s a secret."" The operation was a great success, and a new person appeared. Later he married and became a lawyer. One day, he asked his father, ""Who gave me the ears? Who gave me so much? I could never do enough for him or her."" ""I do not believe you could,"" said the father, ""but the agreement was that you are not to know... not yet."" The years kept their secret, but the day did come. He stood with his father over his mother' s casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish brown hair to show the mother had no outer ears. ""Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,"" his father whispered gently, ""and nobody ever thought Mother less beautiful, did they?"""	['His mother.']
Peters' experience tells us that we should _ .	"Lexi Peters, a 14-year-old girl in New York, loves hockey. She's not only good at playing on her after-school team, but also at playing hockey video games. But when Peters played the popular NHL (National Hockey League) games made by Electronic Arts, something really bothered her. The virtual character in the game could only be a boy -- not a girl. She didn't think that was reasonable. There must be many girls playing hockey in the US. So she wrote a letter to Electronic Arts. ""Being represented by a man is unfair to women and girl hockey players,"" Peters wrote. ""Women's hockey is a fast-growing sport. I am confident that I'm not the only woman interested in the opportunity to create herself in the game."" Several weeks later, Peters received an unexpected e-mail from the senior producer for EA Sports' NHL games, David Littman. ""Hi, Lexi,"" the e-mail began. ""We agree with you!"" Electronic Arts said it would create a female player in the game. ""I was thinking you could be the model,"" Littman wrote. Peters almost couldn't believe it. Later, she sent photos of herself taken at all different angles . And so, when Electronic Arts released the newest version of their game, NHL 12, this fall, Peters was the face of the female player. She can now skate with the NHL's great players. ""It's strange at first, but you get used to it,"" said Peters. ""It's really funny and cool."" For Peters, there is also an important lesson that she will take with her the rest of her life. ""If you have something to say, and you think it's important, go for it!"" she said."

What's the best title of this passage?	"A recent Living Social survey showed that Americans may live up to their poor reputation while travelling abroad. But what's more surprising is that many of those surveyed self-identified themselves as 'ugly' Americans and the world's worst travelers. Those in the U.S. ranked themselves as the worst travellers by a shocking 20 per cent, followed by 15 per cent saying the Chinese were the most substandard tourists. Americans topped the list as being the worst-behaved travelers in a survey of 5,600 respondents, 4,000 of whom were Americans. Other respondents were in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. But even American respondents considered their compatriots as the worst travelers from a list of 16 nationalities. Canadians and Australians also put Americans in the No. 1 spot. Irish respondents pointed to U.K. residents and U.K. respondents gave Germans the nod. On the other hand, 37% of Americans opted for ""none of the above"" in answer to the worst-tourists question, displaying more tolerance and open-mindedness than the other nationalities. Other survey questions had respondents admitting _ from hotels. Four in ten U.S. survey-takers said they'd stolen something - mostly towels (28%) and bathrobes (8%). Other popular pinched items included pillows, remote controls, Bibles and sheets. Not surprising is that Americans have less time off from work than other nationalities. Americans reported getting 16 days off, compared with 28 days for the Irish, 27 days for Australians, 23 days for U.K. workers; and 21 days for Canadians. In the travel mishaps department, the most common travel disaster reported by Americans was lost luggage on an airline (21%); bad weather (21%); and getting very lost (16%). As for places Americans most want to see, Disney World and Las Vegas made the top 10, but they weren't at the top of the heap. And New York didn't make the cut."

What is the passage mainly about?	"What do you do if you're stranded on a lonely island? Surely you need to find a way to get in touch with the outside world. Your best chance of doing this is to draw the attention of a passing plane. Body signals Pilots from different countries understand body signals if they have the correct training. When you wave your arms up and down in a straight line, it means ""yes"". When you point downwards and swing your arm from side to side, it means ""no"". If you want the pilot to know that it's safe to land, push your hands out in front of you and bend your knees. If you want to say that it's not safe to land, put your arms in the air and move them to one side. Smoke signals The smoke from a fire can be seen from far away, so it's a good way to draw attention. If the weather is dry, it isn't hard to start a fire. Remember, however, that fires can be very dangerous if they get out of control. Never light a fire unless you're sure that it can't spread. If the ground is dark, light smoke can be seen more easily. Green grass and leaves produce light smoke. Ground-to-air signals It's a good idea to build some signals, too. Use large pieces of wood to make the symbols . If you can't find any wood, use earth. Some useful symbols are: F ""I need food and water."" II ""I need medicine."" I ""I am badly hurt."" X"" I am unable to move from here."" Pilots' replies If the pilot lowers the plane's wings from side to side, this means ""message received and understood"". (At night, the pilot flashes the plane's green lights.) If the pilots flies the plane in a clockwise circle, this means ""message received but not understood"".(At night, the pilot flashes the plane's red lights.) However, there is no signal which means ""message not received"". Why not?"	['Ways of sending out signals on a lonely island.']
Which of the following is right according to the passage?	An Englishman was once traveling in Italy. One day he went into a small restaurant to order dinner. He understood very little Italian and couldn't read the menu . He knew the word for eggs, and so he ordered eggs. Italy is famous, however, for its mushrooms with eggs. But he did not know the word for mushrooms. The waiter did not speak a word of English and could not help him. At last, the man took out his pocket a pencil and a piece of paper and very carefully drew a picture of a mushroom on the piece of paper. The waiter looked at the picture of the mushroom for a long while. He did not understand very well, but at last he left. He was gone a long time. After about a half hour he returned. But instead of an order of mushroom, he brought the man a large black umbrella.	"[""The waiter didn't know English at all.""]"
Who is the intended reader of the passage?	The first step in exercising for most people is determining whether or not they should. This is particularly true with anyone over thirty-five, especially if they have been heavy smokers. Likewise, young adults who have been very inactive should proceed slowly and with caution. A physical evaluation from a physician is recommended, preferably one that includes an exercise-stress test. While a person is exercising, a stress test detects cardiovascular problems that might not show up when the body is at rest. This is done by monitoring blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen consumption, and the heart's electrical activity while exercising. Whatever exercise program is selected, it is important to start with warm-up periods. These should include stretching exercises, jumping jacks, or active walking. The idea is to increase heart rate and circulation slowly without placing a sudden strain on the heart or the muscles that are starting to work. The next phase in developing an exercise program is to determine the amount of exercise that is enough to condition the muscles and cardiovascular system without excessively exhausting the body. This involves taking one's pulse and finding one's target zone. This target zone, or safe-training pulse rate, is established by subtracting one's age from 220 and then taking 60 percent to 80 percent of that total. If you are just starting to exercise, 60 percent is recommended; 80 percent is recommended if you are already in good condition.	['anyone who wants to take up exercise']
The common part in the two versions of Cinderella mentioned in this passage is that _ .	Many of you have heard a Cinderella story, but what you may not know is that there are over a hundred different ways to tell the Cinderella story. Each of these stories is written by a different author. The story of Cinderella has many different versions. The version that most people know is the oldest one written in 1697 by Charles Perrault from France. This is the version where the birds help make Cinderella's dress and the mice turn into carriage men and help Cinderella go to the ball in the pumpkin that turns into a carriage. In this version, many of the animals are Cinderella's friends. They help her meet the Prince, who Cinderella marries, and together they live happily ever after. In another version of this story, written in the 1850s by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm from Germany, there are birds that help Cinderella throughout the story. Cinderella's mother is not living at the beginning of the story. She visits her mother's grave three times a day to say a prayer for her. Cinderella's father has given her a brunch when he goes to the festival. She plants the brunch and her tears water the brunch until it grows into a tall tree. The birds now live in the tree and they give Cinderella a dress of gold and silver and slippers of the same colours. Cinderella goes to the festival to meet and dance with the Prince. Later, Cinderella marries the Prince and they have a nice life ever after. Have you read other versions of the Cinderella story? More than one author can tell a story in a different way from their viewpoints . That is why there are many versions of the same story.	['both Cinderella and the Prince enjoy their marriage life']
Feeling sorry, the author offered the old lady the following EXCEPT _ .	"A few days ago, I was sitting in a Thai restaurant enjoying a meal when I got on a phone call from a friend I hadn't spoken to in a long time. In my enthusiasm and excitement, I talked quite louder than usual voice and in Spanish, my mother tongue. A few minutes into the call, an old lady sitting at the table beside mine got up, seemingly offended, and asked the restaurant staff to relocate a table as far away as possible from this man who seemed to be impolite. I sank in my seat out of embarrassment. I ended the call soon afterwards and felt the urge to apologize. Before getting up, I looked around to see where she was and she was at the table farthest away from me. I noticed that the lady was alone and staring out the window. I found a tinge of sadness or anxiety and perhaps a desire for aloneness and peace. But I had obviously destroyed it minutes earlier. Right then I abandoned my plan for a conventional apologetic gesture. Seeing those funny smile cards in my wallet, I took one out and wrote some words to express my apology. On signing my restaurant bill, I asked a waiter to secretly charge the lady's meal to me and hand her the smile card instead of her bill. Did she take it the wrong way, I wondered? Did she get confused? Did she refuse the anonymous offer? And so on. I just waited and felt nervous to learn the outcome. To my pleasant surprise, things turned out the best possible way. The waiter approached me in a joy, telling me, ""In the many times she had dined here before, I had never seen the old lady smile as she did when receiving the smile card and the $0 bill. She thanked me even though I explained that someone else did the job."""	['an apologetic gesture']

If such unhappy persons insist on keeping the habit, the author suggests that people should _ .	There are two types of people in the world. Although they have equal degree of health and wealth and other forts of life, one bees happy and the other bees unhappy. This arises from the different ways in which they consider things, persons, events and the resulting effects upon their minds. People who are to be happy fix their attention on the convenience of things: the pleasant parts of conversation, the well prepared dishes, the goodness of the wine and the fine weather. They enjoy all the cheerful things. Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the opposite things. Therefore, they are continually dissatisfied. By their remarks, they sour the pleasure of society, offend (hurt) many people, and make themselves disagreeable everywhere. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, such unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied. The intention of criticizing and being disliked is perhaps taken up by imitation . It grows into a habit, unknown to its possessors. The habit may be strong, but it may be cured when those who have it realize its bad effects on their interests and tastes. I hope this little warning may be of service to them, and help them change this habit. Although in fact it is chiefly an act of the imagination, it has serious results in life since it brings on deep sorrow and bad luck. Those people offend many others; nobody loves them, and no one treats them with more than the most mon politeness and respect. This frequently puts them in bad temper and draws them into arguments. If they aim at getting some advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone start a step or speak a word to favor their hopes. If they bring on themselves public objections, no one will defend or excuse them, and many will join to criticize their wrongdoings. These should change this bad habit and be pleased with what is pleasing, without worrying needlessly about themselves and others. If they do not, it will be good for others to avoid any contact with them. Otherwise, it can be disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient, especially when one bees mixed up in their quarrels.

"What is the greatest value of ""dinner time"" to the author?"	"Papa, as a son of a dirt-poor farmer, left school early and went to work in a factory, for education was for the rich then. So, the world became his school. With great interest, he read everything he could lay his hands on, listened to the town elders and learned about the world beyond his tiny hometown. ""There's so much to learn,"" he'd say. ""Though we're born stupid, only the stupid remain that way. "" He was determined that none of his children would be denied an education. Thus, Papa insisted that we learn at least one new thing each day. Though, as children, we thought this was crazy, it would never have occurred to us to deny Papa a request. And dinner time seemed perfect for sharing what we had learned. We would talk about the news of the day; no matter how insignificant, it was never taken lightly. Papa would listen carefully and was ready with some comment, always to the point. Then came the moment--the time to share the day's new learning. Papa, at the head of the table, would push back his chair and pour a glass of red wine, ready to listen. ""Felice,"" he'd say, ""tell me what you learned today. "" ""I learned that the population of Nepal is .... "" Silence. Papa was thinking about what was said, as if the salvation of the world would depend upon it. ""The population of Nepal. Hmm. Well . . . . "" he'd say. ""Get the map; let's see where Nepal is. "" And the whole family went on a search for Nepal. This same experience was repeated until each family member had a turn. Dinner ended only after we had a clear understanding of at least half a dozen such facts. As children, we thought very little about these educational wonders. Our family, however, was growing together, sharing experiences and participating in one another's education. And by looking at us, listening to us, respecting our input, affirming our value, giving us a sense of dignity, Papa was unquestionably our most influential teacher. Later during my training as a future teacher /1 studied with some of the most famous educators. They were imparting what Papa had known all along--the value of continual learning. His technique has served me well all my life. Not a single day has been wasted, though I can never tell when knowing the population of Nepal might prove useful."	['Continual learning.']

Anna introduced the idea of drinking afternoon tea because she _ .	"One thing that British and Chinese cultures share is a love for fine tea. Today, when we think of Western tea culture, we often think of the English and beautiful china tea cups. Afternoon tea People believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the English ate only two main meals each day: breakfast and a heavy supper that would last for several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o'clock. This meal included cakes and sandwiches. And tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important, fine china cups and plates and silver teapots, knives, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular social occasions. Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in modern Britain. Will you come for coffee? Coffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use the words ""Will you come for coffee"" to mean ""Would you like to come to my home for a chat?"" Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a ""coffee"" party. Coffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange In the 17th century London, coffeehouses were busy and noisy places. Businessmen and bankers went to coffeehouses to do their business, as well as to drink coffee. In fact, the London Stock Exchange is believed to have started from these coffeehouses."

He knew wolves were a kind of protected animals. However, he also knew most of his neighbors would shoot wolves, too. Shortly after the farmer skinned the wolves, problems began. It seemed that someone didn't like the idea of killing wolves after all. The officials had arrived. Out-of-town reporters got hold of the story. And now the farmer was on trial for his killing of the wolves.	['he was afraid the wolves would cause trouble']
As the passage is not complete, what do you think would follow in its full text? _	Water Pollution and Man Water pollution affects man's health, recreational use of water and sense of beauty. The spread of water-carried disease is of great concern. In highly developed countries in particular, emphasis has changed from concern over bacterial disease to concern over water-carried viral disease. Viral hepatitis , for example, has been found to occur more frequently in cities whose water supplies have comparatively high levels of water impurity. Poisonous chemicals found in streams that are ultimately used for water supplies also create an important public health problem. It is clear that poisonous chemicals must be excluded from water, but more and more chemicals from new pesticides , fertilizers, and other new products have been found in water. Since the public health importance of these chemicals is not yet fully known, they are of increasing concern. The chemicals from fertilizers are also finding their way into water supplies from pollution. As man's desire for water-based recreation increases, greater demands are placed on the quality of the water. The water must not only but be attractive in appearance but also meet certain other conditions. Sports such as swimming involve direct contact with water, and so water standards are raised higher. The range of water quality necessary for industrial processes varies greatly with the intended use of the water. The water used in steel mills, foe example, must have a lower chloride level than that accepted for drinking water. Cooling water can often be of comparatively low sanitary quality. A large part of the water used in the paper-making industry an be of ly low quality in some aspects, but must contain little iron and carbon dioxide.

There are _ people in Mr White's family.	"Mr and Mrs White live in the country( ). Christmas Day ( )is coming. They want to buy some clothes for their family in the city . In the morning, Mr and Mrs White have breakfast. Then they go shopping in their car at 8:30. They get to a store at 9:40. In the store they see a lot of clothes. Mrs White likes the clothes very much. So she buys a T-shirt for their son, a skirt for their daughter, and a sweater for Mr White. She buys a hat for herself , too. After that, Mr White is very tired and hungry . He looks at his watch. Then he says, ""Oh, it's 4:00 in the afternoon, that's too late. I think we must go home now."" So they begin to go home. But they lose their way. Mr White can't find the way home. He sees an old man and asks him, ""Excuse me, sir. Where am I?"" The old man looks at him and the car, ""You're in your car, sir."" he says."	['four']
How many ways does the author suggest to maintain a positive frame of mind?	"Negative self talk and negative energy can affect you in many ways and cause you additional stress. Because of this, developing more positive self talk is an important way to reduce stress in your life. You can help yourself maintain a positive frame of mind which will help with positive self talkby surrounding yourself with positive energy in your life. You can get that by adding some elements to your life. Listening to music that not only has a pleasant melody, but an uplifting message, can be great for developing positive self talk. Have you ever had a song ""stuck in your head"" for a few hours or days, the lyrics repeating themselves in your mind? If those lyrics were positive and inspirational, that would be a good thing. It's a much better mental soundtrack to have than a running stream of complaints, criticisms of self-limiting thoughts, or even songs that had more depressing or sad lyrics. Books on strength, personal power, enlightenment, or self help can be good resources to help you change your outlook and the things you say to yourself. Rather than bringing habitual self-defeating thoughts, you can find yourself thinking of new can-do concepts when times get tough. One of the most important ways you can get and keep positive energy in your life is with the company you keep. Do your friends uplift you, or bring you down? Are they critical, or approving? Ideal friendships provide support when you're down, fun when you're up, wisdom when you're lost. Good friends can inspire you to reach greater heights, and see your strengths even when you don't always. Pay attention to how your friends make you feel, and if they're less than supportive, start putting your energy and time toward people who are better suited to be your friends. In addition, positive affirmations can certainly change your self talk from negative to positive. Now, why not begin working positive affirmations into your life in some creative ways?"	['4.']
Essena O'Neill decided to disconnect herself from social media because _ .	"Social media is one of the fastest-growing industries in today's world. A study conducted by the US think tank Pew Research Center showed that 92 percent of teenagers go online daily. The wide spread of social media has changed nearly all parts of teenagers' lives. Changing relationships High school student Elly Cooper from Illinois said social media often reduces face-to-face communication. ""It makes in-person relationships harder because people give attention to their phones instead of their boyfriends or girlfriends,"" Cooper said. There's also a greater possibility of things getting lost in translation over social media. ""If half of your relationship is over social media, you don't really know how the other person is reacting,"" Sienna Schulte, a junior student from Illinois, said. Yet, some people believe social media has made it easier to start relationships with anyone from anywhere. Beth Kaplan from Illinois met her long-distance friend through social media. He currently lives in Scotland, but they're still able to frequently communicate with one another. ""I can feel close to someone that I'm talking to via FaceTime,"" Kaplan said. Wanting to be ""liked"" The rise of social media has changed the way teenagers see themselves. The 19-year-old Essena O'Neill announced on the social networking service Instagram that she was quitting social media because it made her obsessed with appearing perfect online. Negative comments also can do great damage to a teenager's self-esteem . In particular, anonymous social media apps such as Yik Yak may provide opportunities for cyber bullying . The app allows users within 5 miles (8 km) to create and add comments to everything. Teenagers who get negative comments on these sites can't help but feel hurt. Opening new doors However, Armin Korsos, a student from Illinois, takes advantage of the comments he receives over social media to improve his videos on the social networking site Youtube. ""Social media can help people show themselves and their talents to the world in a way that was never possible before,"" Korsos said. But Korsos recognizes that social media has become a distraction . ""Social media, though it helps people connect with their friends and stay updated, is not all necessary."""

From the passage, we can learn that clowns play at _ .	Do you know that many clowns go to school to learn how to be funny? How would you like to go to that school? You could learn how to walk and talk like a clown. Then you could make people laugh. Clowns may go to school for a year. There they learn to move in funny ways. They learn to run and jump like different animals. They also learn how to fall down in a special way. They make sure they don't get injured. They make every move look easy. But really it's hard work. In a school clowns decide how they will look. They make funny pants and tops. Then clowns have their funny long shoes made. They also learn to make up their faces. Clowns carefully put special paint on, so they look silly. They start by making every part of their feces white. Then they use red paint around their mouths to make them look big. Clowns may paint re spots on each side of their faces, too. Big red noses are added. They put on funny hair or funny hats. Now they look silly. They are ready to go to work! You can see clowns at the circus or parade. They do funny things to surprise people. Ten big clowns may get out of a very small car. Or they may walk on a high rope. Then they almost fall. The faces they make when they try to stand up again make people laugh.	['both A and B']
When the North Pole is tilted toward the sun, the Northern Hemisphere gets _ sunlight.	"The word ""day"" has two meanings. When we talk about the number of days in a year, we are using ""day"" to mean 24 hours. But when we talk about day and night, we are using ""day"" to mean the time between sunrise and sunset. Since the earth looks like a ball, the sun can shine on only half of it at a time. Always one half of the earth is having day and the other half night. A place is moved from day into night and from night into day over and over by the spinning of the earth. At the equator day and night are sometimes the same length. They are each twelve hours long. The sun rises at 6 in the morning and sets at 6 in the evening. For six months the North Pole is tilted toward the sun. In those months the Northern Hemisphere gets more hours of sunlight than the Southern Hemisphere. Days are longer than nights. South of the equator nights are longer than days. For the other six months the North Pole is tilted away from the sun. Then the Southern Hemisphere gets more sunlight. Days are longer than night. North of the equator nights are longer than days. Winter is the season of long nights. Summer is the season of long days."	['more']
The passage mainly tells us about _ .	Hanukkah Hanukkah is a Jewish festival. It is celebrated on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev , which is usually sometime in December. It is often called the festival of lights. The festival celebrates the time, over 2,000 years ago, when the Jewish people fought against an emperor who would not let them follow their own traditions and religion. When the Jewish people won back their temple in Jerusalem, they found there was only enough holy oil to keep the sacred light burning for one day. However, to their surprise, this small amount of oil kept the light burning for eight days and nights, until the people had time to make more oil. At the center of the Hanukkah celebrations is a candlestick (called a Menorah) that holds nine candles. On the first night of Hanukkah the first candle is lit, and each day this candle is used to light another candle, until on the eighth day, the last day, all the candles are lit. During Hanukkah, people go to the synagogue to pray and to remember the miracle of the holy oil. Hanukkah is a time for family and friends to come together. People exchange gifts and greeting cards, and children go to parties. Parents often give their children money at Hanukkah. Potato cakes, called latkes, are a traditional Hanukkah food.

According to this passage,which one is correct?	On Tuesday,a new study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation:Heart Failure revealed that women who ate five or more dishes of baked fish a month had a thirty percent lower risk of heart failure in comparison to women who ate less than one dish a month. Researchers examined the diets of 84,493 women,whose ages ranged from 50 to 79.The women who had eaten lots of baked fish like salmon ,were more healthy than those who mostly ate tuna or white fish. Eating baked fish also appeared to provide a protection against high blood pressure. The study also found that those women who ate more baked fish were likely to have a lower weight,exercise more and eat more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who ate fried fish. Researchers noted that past research had discovered the fatty acids in fish probably decreased the risk of high blood pressure by improving blood pressure along with heart and blood functioning. This study showed the link between eating fish and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect. This study also showed that just by eating one dish of fried fish a week led to a 49% greater risk of heart failure,and eating fried fish led to lower fiber intake and higher calorie intake. The American Heart Association suggested eating a minimum of two dishes of fish especially fatty fish each week.	['The fatty acids in fish can improve blood functioning.']
Walt Whitman expressed his feelings by _ .	Walt Whitman was born in eighteen nineteen in New York City. During his long life, he watched America grow from a young nation to the strongest industrial power in the world. Whitman was influenced by events around him. But his poetry speaks of the inner self. He celebrated great people like President Abraham Lincoln. He also celebrated common people. As a young man, Whitman worked as a school teacher, a printer and a newspaper reporter. He was thirty-six years old when his first book of poetry was published. He called it Leaves of Grass. It has only twelve poems. The poems are written in free verse. The lines do not follow any set form. Some lines are short and some are long. The words at the end of each line do not have a similar sound. They do not rhyme. One of America's greatest thinkers and writers immediately recognized the importance of Leaves of Grass. Ralph Waldo Emerson praised Whitman's work. _ The America's Civil War began in eighteen sixty-one. During the war, Whitman worked without pay at army hospitals. He helped care for the wounded and dying soldiers. He sat beside these men for hours. He brought them food and wrote letters for them. After the Civil War, Whitman worked for government agencies. He watched the United States try to heal itself and increase democracy. To Walt Whitman, democracy was more than a political system or idea. It was a natural form of government for free people. Whitman believed democracy was meant to honor the rights of every person and the equality of all people. In eighteen seventy-three, Walt Whitman suffered a stroke. He spent the last few years of his life in Camden, New Jersey and wrote more poems. Whitman was poor and weak during the last few years of his life. He died in eighteen ninety-two.	['writing poems']
Children can see _ in Blue Ocean Aquarium.	"Blue Ocean Aquarium is a great place for families to take a holiday. Children love to see the sea animals and watch films about sharks in it. Last Saturday morning, Mr Jackson took his wife and two little sons to the aquarium. At the ticket office, he asked, ""How much shall I pay to get in?"" The woman at the ticket office answered, ""The price is 20 dollars for each adult or any kid older than five. We let kids in free if they are five or younger. How old are your kids?"" Mr Jackson said, ""The older one is six and the younger one is three. I think I must buy three tickets. "" The woman was surprised. She said, ""Sir, don't you want to save 20 dollars? If you tell me your older son is five, I won't know the difference. "" Mr Jackson said with a smile, ""Yes, that sounds right, but my kids will know the difference. "" From Mr Jackson' s story, we know _ is very important in the modern society . We should tell the truth to the people around us, especially to the kids."	['dolphins']
In this passage, what does the incoming tide signal?	The young man arrived on the Massachusetts beach early carrying a radio, a shovel , and a strange set of tools: a brick layer's trowel, a palette knife, spatulas, spoons, and a spray bottle. He walked down near the water -- the tide was out -- and switched on the radio to listen to soft rock. Then he shoveled wet sand into a pile nearly four feet high and as many feet across. Then he created a square shape. After that, he set to work with palette knife, spatulas, and spoons. He shaped a splendid tower, topped walls, fashioned beautiful bay windows, and carved out a big front gate. The man knew his sand. He smoothly finished some surfaces and carved artistic designs on others. As the shapes began to dry, he gently kept them slightly wet with water from the spray bottle, in case they might break in the wind. All this took hours. People gathered. At last he stood back, obviously satisfied with a castle worthy of the Austrian countryside or Disneyland. Then he gathered his tools and radio and moved them up to drier sand. He had known for a while what many in the crowd still ignored: the tide was coming in. Not only had he practiced his art with confidence and style, he also had done so against a powerful, irresistible deadline. As the crowd looked on, water came at the base of the castle. In minutes it was surrounded. Then the rising flood began to eat into the base, walls fell, the tower fell, and finally the gate fell. More minutes passed, and small waves erased bay windows -- soon no more than a small part was left. Many in the crowd looked terribly sad; some voiced fear and discouragement. But the man remained calm. He had, after all, had a wonderful day, making beauty out of nothing, and watching it return to nothing as time and tide moved on.	"[""It is the end of a day's work.""]"
Fitzgerald's screenwriting was _ .	"When people think of Hollywood, they think of the city where dreams come true. This did not apply to F. Scott Fitzgerald, a screenwriter who had his share of ups and downs in this land. Fitzgerald was not a successful Hollywood writer because he was not good at the career path he chose. He was an amazing novelist, but his efforts of turning them into screenplays ended in disappointment and confusion. It was because of a lack of potential for screenwriting as well as his addiction and desire to be famous. Growing up as a boy, Fitzgerald went to movies a lot. He wanted to write stories that would eventually turn into movies. The problem was: just because Fitzgerald wanted to do something didn't necessarily mean that he was good at it. He made his attempts, but most of these efforts ended in disappointment because he thought about the change from script to screen too much. His plot was too detailed and complicated; his tone was too serious or his dialogue too sentimental . Fitzgerald's quick rise to fame also led to his fall. In life, things are not meant to happen all at once, all that the same time but it did for Fitzgerald. At his best time, three of his early stories were made into short films, including The Great Gatsby and Babylon Revisited. As the twenties approached, he was gradually forgotten by the reading public. He became drunk and constantly took pills both to sleep and wake up. His marriage was destroyed and his wife broke down mentally. He seemed unsure about his life. Fitzgerald had another chance at success when many opportunities came his way, including revisions of Emlyn William's play The Light of Heart and production of one of his own scripts, Cosmopolitan. However, these were all put aside and he was right back where he started, left behind and called a ""ruined man"". Fitzgerald simply wanted too much in his life. He wanted ""to be both a great novelist and a Hollywood success, to write songs like Cole Porter and poetry like John Keats"". His addiction to fame held him back and led to his failure as a Hollywood writer."	['complex in plot']
How many students get their scholarships each year according to the Straightforward Teacher Program ?	Becoming a teacher is one of the best ways to make a difference in the life of a child and even older students. Here are some great scholarships and grant opportunities to get the ball rolling on your dreams of becoming a teacher. Straightforward Teacher Program This is one of the most popular and unique scholarships available for students working towards becoming teachers. The foundation offers their scholarships every three months as opposed to each year. During each payment, four students receive a $500 scholarship. Prezell Robinson Scholarship Program While this scholarship is available only to students in the state of North Carolina, it is so incredibly helpful that many students choose to study in the state for the only purpose of receiving it. It is offered to college students who come from low-income high schools or families that are interested in pursuing a long term career in education at any level. New York State Scholarship Program Officials in the state of New York founded this program to award students who want to give back to their community through their ability to teach. The catch for this scholarship is that the students must be pursuing a teaching career in mathematics or science at the secondary level. Also, because the program was designed to improve the education system in New York, the candidates must sign a service contract agreeing to work full time within the state for at least five years after graduation. Coca-Cola Scholarships You may have many opportunities for grants and scholarships through The Coca Cola Foundation. There is the Coca Cola Teaching Foundation that will provide free money for students pursuing an education in the teaching field. This is the most obvious for teachers, but do not be afraid to check out their other offers. Funds For Teachers Not all scholarships or grants are for students entering or already in college. The Funds for Teachers scholarships are for graduates who are already working in the field, but want to improve their possibilities, skills and education in an effort to increase their ability to teach the students that cross their path more effectively. Teachers in PreK through 12th grade are applicable no matter where they teach or what subject they specialize in.	['Sixteen']
Why did Paul go to college to study the science of plants?	"When Paul was a boy growing up in Utah, he happened to live near a copper smelter ,and the chemicals that poured out had made a wasteland out of what used to be a beautiful forest. One day a young visitor looked at this wasteland and called it an awful area. Paul knocked him down. From then on, something happened inside him. Years later Paul was back in the area, and he went to the smelter office. He asked if they had any plans or if they would let him try to bring the trees back. The answer from that big industry was ""No"". Paul then went to college to study the science of plants. Unfortunately, his teachers said there weren't any birds or squirrels to spread the seeds. It would be a waste of his life to try to do it. Everyone knew that, he was told. Even if he was knowledgeable as he had expected, he wouldn't get his idea accepted. Paul later got married and had some kids. But his dream would not die. And then one night he did what he could with what he had. As Samuel Johnson wrote, ""It is common to overlook what is near by keeping the eye fixed on something remote. Attainable good is often ignored by minds busied in wide ranges."" Under the cover of darkness, he went secretly into the wasteland and started planting. And every week, he made his secret journey into the wasteland and planted trees and grass. For fifteen years he did this against _ . Slowly rabbits appeared. Later, as there was legal pressure to clean up the environment, the company actually hired Paul to do what he was already doing. Now the place is fourteen thousand acres of trees and grass and bushes, and Paul has received almost every environmental award Utah has. It took him until his hair turned white, but he managed to keep that impossible vow he made to himself as a child."	['Because he thought his knowledge would make his advice more persuasive.']
They all chuckled because _ .	"My husband, Micheal, and I were at a restaurant with his boss, a rather stern elderly man. When Micheal began a story I was sure he had told before, I gave him a kick under the table. There was no response, so I gave him another kick. Still the story went on. Suddenly he stopped and said with a smile, ""Oh, but I've told you this one before, haven't I ?"" We all chuckled and changed the subject. Later, on the dance floor, I asked my husband why it had taken him so long to get my message. ""What do you mean?"" he replied. ""I cut off the story as soon as you kicked me."" ""But I kicked you twice, and it still took you a while to stop!"" Suddenly we realized what had happened and returned to our table. The boss smiled and said, ""Don't worry. After the second one I thought it wasn't for me, so I passed it along!"""	['they all thought each of them had done something interesting']
The purpose of the author in writing this passage is to _ .	"If you are hungry, what will you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like stomach, even your mind will be hungry. But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things. So it silently begins to hide your needs and never lets itself grow. When mind loses its freedom to grow, creativity gets its full stop. This might be the reason why we all sometimes think ""What happens next?"", ""Why can't I think?"", ""Why am I always given the difficult problems?"" Well, this is the after-effect of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading. But why is it reading but not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educational tool used by us right from the childhood. Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to turn to reading for help. You have a number of books in the world which will answer all your ""how-to"" questions. Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but your mind decodes it and explains it to you. The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed. Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas. The same seed, if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, which you would never thought of in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity. The more books you read, the wider your mind will become. Also this improves your oratorical (speech-making) skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary. When you start speaking English or any other language fluently with your friends or other people, you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time. Actually, I had a problem in speaking English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly. So guys, do join me and give food for your thoughts by reading, reading and more reading. Now what are you waiting for? Go, grab a book and let me know!"	['explain and persuade']
Which is the best title for the passage?	"Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little red-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a ""Merry Christmas,"" and asked her to see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to find their little books also, one grey-color1ed, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day. ""Girls,"" said Meg seriously, ""Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day."" Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face. Much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters' example, the other two started reading too. And then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting. ""Where is Mother?"" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later. ""Your ma went straight off to see what was needed in a poor woman's home."" Replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant. ""She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready,"" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time."" ""There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick!"" cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall. The girls rushed to the table, eager for breakfast. ""Merry Christmas, Mummy! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day,"" they all cried happily together. ""Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?"" They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed excitedly, ""I'm so glad you came before we began!"" Then the four girls put the cream, the muffins and the buckwheat bread into a big basket. ""I thought you'd do it,"" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied."" You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner time."" They were soon ready, and the procession set out. A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, crying baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm. How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in. ""Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!"" said the poor woman, crying for joy. ""Funny angels in hoods and mittens ,"" said Jo, and set them to laughing. In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak . Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel , and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of it. When they went away, leaving comfort behind, there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls. They gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning."	['A Merry Christmas']
What can we conclude from the passage?	"Do you always forget where you placed your keys or your purse? What was the name of the movie you saw last week? The major cause of your forgetfulness may be linked to what you store in your body, not in your short-term memory bank. Tests continue to show that people with enough Vitamin B-2 do well in memory exams. The ""B"" could stand for ""brain"", if you're one of many with limited instant recall. And the number one source of that vitamin is sunflower seeds. Even when you're sleeping or relaxing, your brain is still at work. Although it makes up just two percent of your total body weight, it uses up to 30 % of the calories you take in each day. For it to work properly, it must be fed. Even if you're not a breakfast eater, that meal is the best way to prepare your brain for the day. A quick and easy English _ with peanut and butter in it, a glass of milk, and an orange, might be what your brain may be asking you the first thing in the morning when you feel your head is in a fog. Having sunflower seeds and fruit between meals adds more muscle to that hungry, demanding organ. Vitamin B-1 also helps the memory, and that is found in eggs, meats and nuts. In Chinese culture, walnuts are known as the fruit for a long life because it is believed that they feed both the kidneys and the brain. And according to Chinese culture, if you keep those two important organs in good working order, you'll live longer. However forgetful you are, just keep in mind the letter ""B"", which will help you to ""bear in mind almost everything"" even on those days when life's challenges are sending you in a billion directions."	['What we eat seems more important than what we learn in terms of memory.']
The passage tells us that with the development of cars, we may _ .	"Imagine a world where air pollution is no longer a problem. Clean air is all around us. People don't have to worry about polluting the air every time they drive their cars. They no longer need to face the problem of not having enough fuel either. Although scientists have been trying for many years to develop a new kind of car that does not need gasoline , _ have been unsuccessful. Recently, however, car engineers have succeeded in creating a new kind of car that runs on gasoline and electricity . This is the famous ""hybrid car"". This car gets its name from the fact that it has a gasoline engine and an electric motor inside. Hybrid cars do not pollute the environment as much as the cars that are commonly used today. They also cost drivers less money because they need less fuel than ordinary cars. Hybrid cars are becoming widely popular in the United States. They are soon expected to become widely used around the world. If scientists and engineers continue to work on car development, perhaps the world with clean air that we imagined earlier just might become real in the future."	['live in the world with clean air']
According to the passage, which of the following is increasingly dangerous to sea animals?	Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean.	['The man-made noises.']
Why does Mrs. Ward always use the same Valentine's Day card?	"There's no danger of 88-year-old Harry Ward forgetting his wife Doris's Valentine's Day card - the couple still use the same one he bought her 70 years ago. When 17-year-old Harry Ward presented Doris with a Valentine's Day card as he boarded a train to join the wartime effort on February 14, 1941, he must have been fairly confident about his affections . After all the couple had been dating since they met in a cafe three months earlier. But little can he have imagined that 70 years on, not only would he still be happy about having married Doris, but that every year she would present him with the very same card he gave her that Valentine's Day. ""I bring it out of the cupboard and put it on our mantelpiece every Valentine's Day,"" she said. ""It's a special to me now as it was 70 years ago. Harry has never bought me one since, because I have this one every year."" They first met in a cafe. ""Harry was in the cafe drinking and he said hello. He asked me my name and we got talking happily. He offered to walk me to the bus stop but when we got outside, a bombing raid had started and we had to run to a nearby air-raid shelter ,"" Doris said. Mr. Ward said,""I knew Doris was the one for me the moment I met her. I gave her the Valentine's card then and she is still my Valentine now."" Mrs. Ward's card is not the only thing that has endured the passing of time. ""Harry is quite romantic and we are as still in love as the day he first gave me this card,""Dorris said."

What will be the future of the Beijing Opera?	Beijing opera or Peking opera (Pinyin: Jingju) is a form of Chinese opera which arose in the late 18th century and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century.The form was extremely popular in the Qing Dynasty court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China.Major performance troupes (,) are based in Beijing and Tianjin in the north,and Shanghai in the south.The art form is also enjoyed in Taiwan,and has spread to other countries such as the United States and Japan. Beijing opera features four main types of performers.Performing troupes often have several of each variety,as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers.With their elaborate (,) and colorful costumes,performers are the only focal points on Beijing opera's characteristically small stage.They make use of the skills of speech,song,dance,and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive,rather than realistic.Above all else,the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements.Performers also hold a variety of stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production.The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music.The music of Beijing opera can be divided into the Xipi and Erhuang styles.Melodies include arias ,fixed-tune melodies,and percussion patterns.The repertoire of Beijing opera includes over 1,400 works,which are based on Chinese history,folklore,and,increasingly,contemporary life. In recent years,Beijing opera has attempted numerous reforms in response to sagging audience numbers.These reforms,which include improving performance quality,adapting new performance elements,and performing new and original plays,have met with mixed success.Some Western works have been adopted as new plays,but a lack of funding and an adverse political climate have left Beijing opera's fate uncertain as the form enters the 21st century.

How does Ridley look at shopping?	"Feeling blue about world ? ""Cheer up."" Says science writer Matt Ridley.""The world has never been a better place to live in, and it will keep on getting better both for humans and got nature."" Ridley calls himself a tat ional optimist--tactical .because he's carefully weighed the evidence optimistic .because that offence shows human progress to be both unavoidable and good .And this is what he's set out to prone from unique point of view in his most recent book. The Rant anal Opting .He views mankind as grand enterprise that .on the whole .has done little but progress for 100.000 years. He backed his finding with hard gathered though years of research. Here's how he explains his views. Shopping fuels invention It is reported that there are more than ten billion different producers for sale in London alone. Even allowing for the many people who still live in poverty .our own generation has access to more nutritious food .more convenient transport .bigger houses, better ears .and of course, more pounds and dollars than any who lived before us .This will continue as long as we there things to make other things, This more we specialize and exchange, the better off we'll be. 2) Brilliant advances One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ener before is that the four most basie human needs -food, clothing, fuel and shelter- have grown a lot cheaper. Take one example. In 1800 a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s the same light from an oil lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950 it was eight seconds. Today it's half second. 3) Let's not kill ourselves for climate change Mitigating climate change could prove just as damaging to human welface as climate change itself. A child that dies from indoor smoke in a village, where the use of fassil-fuel electrieity is forhidden by well meaming members of green polucal movements trying to save the world, is just as great a tragedy as a child that mes in a flood caused by climate change.

What does Jason say about long summer holidays?	"In many countries, schools have long summer holidays, with shorter holidays in between.However, a new report suggests shortening school holidays to stop children forgetting what they have learnt during the long summer break.Instead of three school terms, it says, there should be five eight-week terms.And there should be just four weeks off in the summer, with a two-week break between the other terms. Sonia Montero has two children at primary school and works full-time.She supports the idea.""The kids,"" she says, "" have much longer holidays then and I can't afford to take several weeks off work, so I need someone to take care of them.But nobody wants the work in the summer holidays -- they all have holidays of their own. Not surprisingly, some young people disagree.Student Jason Panos says , ""It's a stupid idea.I would hate staying at school in the summer.It's unfair, too.The people who suggest this had long school holidays when they were young, but now they want to stop us enjoying the summer.The kids in Spain and American have much longer holidays than here, but they don't forget everything they've learnt in a few months."" Nadia Salib agrees.""Sure,"" she says, ""the first week at school after the summer is never easy, but you soon get back into it.The real problem round here is that kids get bored after so many weeks out of school, and then some of them start causing trouble.But the answer is to give them something to do, not make everyone stay in school longer."""

How can parents reduce children's bargaining power?	"It may not be news to parents of teenage girls, but researchers have confirmed that no one can stop their 16-year-old daughter from deciding how the family spends its money. The willpower and determination of teenage girls in how a family's money is spent on everything from food and meals to mobile phones, and, of course, clothes. Teenage boys did not show up at all in the analysis, which was designed to find out the influence of young people on household spending. The findings on the spending power of teenage girls were calculated from Office for National Statistics records of family spending during the 1980s and 1990s. Researchers examined how much money went on services and leisure goods in different kinds of homes. They checked spending on food, restaurant meals, alcohol, tobacco, services, heating, transport, clothes and sports in 2,745 British families. They found that teenage girls in the UK typically played an active role in family decisions about the allocation of household resources. But older children-- those over the age of 21 who are still living with their parents--appear to have no say in household decisions. They also tried to calculate to what extent the bargaining power of a teenager affected family budgets. ""Every parent knows that children, even at a very early age, have their own preferences with regard to consumption, researchers said. ""But children are only interested in a limited range of goods--mainly sweets and toys--and parents are able to use punishment to reduce their children's bargaining power or remove it."" When they become teenagers, however, girls are much more independent and they are capable of earning their own money, which improves their bargaining power in family decisions. The researchers could not explain why girls have more influence over spending while the evidence for boys is much less conclusive. However, this study could be of great significance to market research and how marketers target children."	['By threatening to punish them.']
What can we know about the old man from the passage?	"When I was a child, my parents often took me to an old house in a thick forest. No other children ever stayed there. I didn't even have the choice of playing with a brother or sister. I could never understand what the attraction of the house was, even for my parents, who enjoyed nothing better than to sit in silence with a good book. The woman in the house, my father's distant cousin, was a terrible cook and her food was _ . One day, when I was wandering around the garden behind the house, I noticed a wooden house which had clearly been abandoned . As I walked towards it, I heard a noise, like an animal moving hurriedly away. Then I saw a man with a long beard standing at the door. I was greatly surprised. ""Please don't tell them you saw me,"" he said. ""They never use this place, and I have nowhere else to live."" ""Don't worry,"" I said. ""I won't tell anyone. But are you all right out here? I mean--do you have enough to eat?"" The old man shook his head. The same evening, I took a small plastic bag into the dining room and, while no one was looking, emptied some of the food into it. Later, I got out of the back door secretly and gave the food to the old man, whose name I had discovered was Taff. I had never seen anything else as lovely as the smile of satisfaction on Taff's face when he ate the food. From then on, my visits to the old house had a purpose, and I enjoyed every minute of the rest of my stay."	['He was poor and hungry.']
The author mentions his competition with his neighbors to _ .	It does not matter who wins. We are told that from day one. Usually, that statement is followed by some remark about being a loser. If we do not care who wins, then why do we compete? Fun, experience, the chance to meet new people --- these are the reasons we try to outdo each other. People will compete over anything. Every Christmas, my neighbors and I have a little Christmas light competition. It is heaven for the electric company, but I think we give Will Rogers Airport a scare. It is bright enough to land a plane in our front yards. I admit that last year my neighbors won, but only because they bought every strand of lights Wal-Mart had before I could get there. Personal competitions are great, but we get a little carried away. I cannot stand to see coaches shout at kids playing sports. Who cares if someone messes up and the other team advances? I'm tired of people competing just to win. It happens not only in sports, but in music competitions, too. People auditioning for chair placement in certain bands can get really unfriendly. This year I did not audition for a certain band, but I went to auditions anyway. This was the first time I actually had the opportunity to comprehend the whole picture. Other times I've been the person who was nervous and anxious. This time, I sat back and observed everyone else. I came to the realization that the people who aren't so good are terrified of the good people, and the good people are scared stiff that the bad people have taken lessons and can now show them up. Unless a person is on the outside looking in, I don't think anyone realizes _ . Maybe competing is human nature, but we shouldn't let it influence our judgment. Being disrespectful to opponents , letting competition become our life, and becoming so involved that we close ourselves off from friends and family is not the meaning of competition. A little competition is healthy, so it shouldn't hurt anyone. If it does, someone somewhere needs to back off, find the good thing hidden inside, and try it again. Winning isn't everything, and losing isn't the end of the world.	['show people really care about the result of competition']
When he looked at a boy in a certain way, that boy _ .	"My grandfather was a teacher. He was the headmaster of a school for boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen. I know that he was a kind and gentle man at heart, because when I was young (and he was old), he gave me presents and seated me on his knees, and told me stories. But I believe the boys at his school were afraid of him. At school, when he walked into a classroom full of noisy boys, those boys went red in the faces, and looked down at their shoes. If a boy brought him poor, careless work, which was not the best that boys could do, my grandfather picked up the boy's work and threw it across the classroom, shouting, ""Do it all again, and bring it back early in the morning!"" If the boy was late, or if he forgot to bring the work, he had to do it again. My grandfather never forgot. He was a very different man at school, from the man I saw day by day in his own home."

If a wild goose falls out of the V formation, _ .	Next autumn when you see wild geese heading south for the winter flying in a V formation you might think about what scientists have discovered as to why they fly that way. As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an uplift for the bird immediately following. By flying in a V formation the whole group adds at least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flies on its own. People who share a common direction and sense of community can get where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on the push of one another. When a wild goose falls out of the formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go alone and quickly tries to get back into the formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front. When the head goose gets tired, it flies back into the formation and another goose flies to the front. It is wise to take turns doing difficult jobs whether it be people or wild geese flying south. Wild geese honk from behind to inspire those up front to keep up their speed. What can we learn from this? When a wild goose gets sick or wounded by gunshots, and falls out of the formation, two other geese will fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection. They will stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly or until it dies, and only then will they go on with their own or with another formation to catch up with their group.

How much electricity can be produced per day by T-Boxes along a railway track of 100km?	Researchers around the world have been trying their hand at making better use of the huge amount of wind energy available in nature to produce clean energy. Apart from this, studies are being carried out to harness usable wind energy produced by man-made technologies. One useful source identified by Indian inventor Santosh Pradhan about two years ago is a speeding train, which produces fierce wind that can be transformed into electricity. According to Pradhan's proposal, with a few small improvements in existing trains running in Mumbai, the largest city in India, at least 10,000 megawatts of electricity could be harvested each day. Building on this principle, designers Ale Leonetti Luparinia and Qian Jiang from Yanko Design have created a device called T-Box that harnesses wind energy from speeding trains. T-Box can be placed within the railway tracks. It is half-buried underground between the concrete sleepers , which does not disturb the normal train operating at all. According to Yanko, around 150 T-Boxes can be fitted along a 1,000-meter railway track. A train running at a speed of 200 kph can produce winds blowing at 15 miles a second. Based on this calculation, 150 T-Boxes can produce 2.6 KWH of electricity per day. The T-Box's design won a silver medal in last year's Lite-On Awards and was exhibited last summer at the Xue Xue Institute in Taipei, Taiwan Province. Though the figures look impressive, it is important to remember that the design is still at a conceptual stage and hasn't taken into account issues such as pieces of waste material produced by the device and the efforts and costs involved in the maintenance of the device. We can expect the technology to see the light of the day only after it clears these issues. If so, rail travel, one of the greenest forms of travel, will become greener and more energy-efficient.

"Why do some companies "" sell"" their music for free?"	"When the recent research was analyzed , it was found that a lot of people wanted free pictures or free music from the Web. If it couldn't be free, then they wanted it ""new"" or at least at a low price. It seems that 70 percent of people aged 16 to 24 download music online but only 1 in 40 tracks are bought legally. Thus, some companies are planning to give all of their music away for free. The music will be totally free except that you will have to pay with your time by watching advertisements. This will be perfect for those who have lots of time but little money. The Web has encouraged a belief that things can be free, or at least very cheap. It seems that everyone is looking for a good deal on the Web. The desire for free objects is part of the nature of the Web because the Web is about self-service and self-service is all about being free, cheap, fast and convenient. It's interesting how words change their meaning. Stealing has now become file sharing, but it's not really stealing, is it? Free is a funny word. We all know that very little is really for free. If we go searching on the Web for free music, we know--or should know--that there are risks involved. However, it doesn't matter. We still want free things, or at least the sense that we're getting a real bargain and that at a minimum we're saving time. What can be the worst experience on the Web? A site that charges us high prices and wastes our time."	['They can earn money from the advertisements added in the music.']
According to this passage, we know that _ .	"Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, ""Thank you."" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, "" I love you, my dear son."" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, ""I love you."" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me. I've learned to appreciate every relationship I have, to tell people I care about them, and to never take anything in life for granted."	"[""The author's work greatly influenced him""]"

Which is NOT right below about the stone lions in front of the gates of the old houses?	"Lion is a special animal to Chinese people. A couple of stone lions, a male and a female , can often be seen in front of the gates of old buildings. The male lion is on the left with his right paw on a ball, and the female on the right.

The ball shows the country or the family will be together forever, and the baby animal with the female shows that you will have many children.

How will you feel if germs go into the finger that is cut?	Everyone likes living in a clean and comfortable environment. If the environment are bad, it will affect our body, and make us not feel well. Sometimes we may be terribly ill. At that time we don't want to work, and we have to stay in bed and rest at home. So the environment is very important to us. It's germs that makes us ill. There are germs everywhere, They are very small and you can't find them with your own eyes, but you can see them with a microscope They are very small and there may be hundreds of them on a very small thing, Germs can always be found in dirty water. When we look at dirty water under the microscope, we shall see them in it. Germs can also be found in air and dust . If you cut your finger, some of the dust from the floor may go into it, and you will have much pain in it. Sometimes the germs will go into all of your bodies, and you will have pain everywhere.

How did they find Chaffey College?	"I come to the United States ten year ago. I would always say that I was trying to study, but there were always things like work and my kids that would not allow me to start. Now I realized that those were only excuses. What stopped me was that I was afraid to start studying again. I always believed I would learn by myself. One day, however, my son told me that he was sad because his friends would come over and I didn't understand them because I didn't speak English. He was also sad because I could never help him with his homework. That same day, I told myself, ""Rocio, you have to start believing in yourself and you will see you can make it."" The next day, I went downtown to look for a big banner in front of the school which said that they offered classes for adults. I came in to see if I could join, but the classes were closed already. That night I took the kids to the movies, and on the way back, I told them we would take a new route. I ended up getting lost. That's the way I found Chaffey College. The following Monday, I went to ask for information. They told me that summer school was starting that week. That's how I started studying English last summer. It is difficult, but I have had great rewards. My daughter had to write a story for school. It was about the female they most admired and why . She wrote that I was the person she most admired because I had started going to College. I will never forget this."	['They took a new route and got lost.']
In Camilla Kring's opinion, B-people _ .	"A group of people from Denmark have formed the B-Society. According to them, human beings are divided into types: A-People, and B-People. A-People have no problem getting up in the morning, and operate much better earlier in the day. However, B-people are better later in the day. ""I'm useless early in the morning,"" says one of the members of the B-Society.""All I can do is drink coffee, and stare into space. People used to get up early because they had to feed the animals. But I haven't got any cows or chickens, so I can sleep late,"" She adds. Since the society was set up, the B-Society has welcomed several thousand members. Right now, the B-Society is fighting hard for businesses to join its B-certification list. Companies that are ""B-certified"" basically give their employees the opportunity to come in when they want. In some companies, employees arrive at any time up to 3:30 pm --- each to their own rhythm . And it is not just businesses that are benefiting from this. Teenagers who can't get out of bed in the morning, and parents who never quite get the kids to school on time, can now benefit from B-classes. From next year, a school in Copenhagen will offer classes which start later in the day (at 10 instead of eight). And even the government seems to like the idea. The B-Society was founded by Camilla Kring, a professor from the University of Copenhagen. On her website, she says, ""When B-people's work rhythms are considered at the work place, their productivity and quality of life is increased, which can increase productivity for the entire organization."" She adds that, ""B-Society will create a new daily rhythm in schools and other institutions as an alternative to the current rhythm of 'early at work and early at home'. We are working for the establishment of kindergartens, primary and secondary schools as well as universities that open between 10 am and 8 pm."" Would you like to work for a B-certified company?"

How often does the writer send e-mails?	6 June, Saturday I read an article about people living in e-age yesterday. It talks about different ways of communicating like chatting on line, sending e-mails, sending different kinds of messages and keeping an online diary. The article says that people nowadays send e-mails at least once a day. I don't agree with this because I send e-mail only twice a week. However, I do check my e-mail once a day. I like receiving e-mails. About chatting online, the article says that chatting on line is becoming more and more popular among teenagers. I think this is true. Whenever I arrive at home, I turn on my computer and log on to chat online with my friends. I prefer chatting online to calling a friend, because I can chat with many friends at the same time. But I like using mobile phones. When I do not have my computer with me I can send short massages to my friends. I also like keeping in touch with them in this way.

Brenda became famous because _ .	"Brenda Bongos was a happy, artistic girl. She had one big ambition--to play the drums in a band. But one big obstacle lay in her way. To be good enough to play in a band, Brenda had to practice a lot, but she lived next-door to a lot of old people. Many of them are sick. She knew that the sound of beating drums would really get on their nerves. So, she had tried playing in the strangest places: a basement, a kitchen, and even in a shower. But there was always someone it would annoy. One day, while watching a science documentary on TV, she heard that sound cannot travel in space, because there's no air. At that moment, Brenda Bongos decided to become a sort of musical astronaut. With the help of a lot of time, books and work, Brenda built a space bubble. This was a big glass ball connected to a machine which sucked out all the air inside. All that would be left inside was a drum kit and a chair. Brenda got into the space suit she had made, entered the bubble, turned on the machine, and played those drums like a wild child. It wasn't long before Brenda Bongos came very famous. Many people came to see her play in her space bubble. Shortly afterwards she came out of the bubble and started giving concerts. Her fame spread so much that the government suggested that she be part of a unique space journey. Finally, Brenda was a real musical astronaut, and had gone far beyond her first ambition of playing drums in a band. Years later, when asked how she had achieved all this, she thought for a moment, and said: ""If those old people next - door hadn't mattered so much to me, I wouldn't have found a solution, and none of this would have ever happened."""

Which of the following things wasn't found by the police?	"Yesterday the police were joined by more than 20 volunteers in the continuing search for the two missing teenagers, Vicky Gray and Tom Hunter, and their guide, Gavin Jones.

Later on Chief Inspector Roger Fleet said, ""The travelers had a radio with them. If they had been in trouble, they would have called us."" The three travelers left Cooktown very early on Saturday morning in aToyota car. They took a small dirt road that runs down to the Daintree River, a dangerous river full of crocodiles . Chief Inspector Roger Fleet said the tourists wouldn't have got into trouble if they had stayed on the main road. A photo of Vicky and Tom was found by a policeman under the ""Be Careful about crocodiles"" sign near the river. Why was the photo left behind? This is just one of the unanswered questions. Other questions are: Why was the photo left behind? Why was theToyotaparked and locked at the edge of the rainforest? The police said that the travelers had left a map of the area behind. Why? Why had someone drawn a cross on the point where the car is? Is this a sign? What does it mean? If anyone can give information or has seen these three young people, contact the local police in Cooktown."	"[""The travelers' radio.""]"
